The deal was done between Mark and Janice at SRP.  I heard him make the call.  Also, do you have any more avenues with PAC tranny like a supervisor or something.  I am not really in a position to negotiate with anyone.  They all claim that they can't change the Oasis system.

The guaranty you are providing to Engage Energy Canada should cover both ECC 
and ENA although should only reference the Master Firm Contract between ECC

reference the Master Contract between ENA and Engage US that is currently

There are two deals for Avista the are marked not to be confirmed.  Can you 
check into these, and if they are not to be confirmed, put a little note as 
to why or who said not to confirm them, so 6 months from now when someone 
says "Why didn't you confirm this deal!"  I'll have something to jog my

1. Any FX business conducted from London must in most cases be done by or

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the

AEP has informed us over the past couple of nights that they MUST HAVE tag numbers in order to do next day checkouts.  They claim that this has always been the case but we know that in the past we have not needed the tag #'s in order to check out. It appears AEP enjoys being difficult.  So it looks like going forward we will need tag numbers from the schedulers in order to check our properly with AEP.

They will pay a premium to get the power at lugo and they will buy the power transmission contingent.

Subject: California "Top Five" list



Sarah:

Please find attached a "top five" list on California market reform, as
requested, with some annotations on why I think these changes would be
beneficial etc. It is quite rough - not much more than a brain dump really -
but can serve as a basis for discussion.

Have a look and see what you think. Perhaps we should set up a call to
discuss sometime later this week?

 In her plea for the proposal, Feinstein said that: "I agree that the
CPUC was wrong to not allow long-term contracts."

 Secretary Abraham and Chairman Hebert were strongly opposed to price
caps.  When asked about the Feinstein/Smith proposal, Abraham noted that he
hadn't seen anything in writing, but that, to the extent the proposal
includes prices caps, the Administration would not support it.  This was
obviously an awkward situation for Abraham

This research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and 
optimization
models are not appropriate for internet-related businesses.  The technological
innovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of
information
which inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices.
Furthermore,
companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can

the Exposure Threshold/Credit Ratings on page 1 of Annex B-1.  As ENA does 
not have a credit rating above BBB+, we have inserted $20 mil. (the BBB+
