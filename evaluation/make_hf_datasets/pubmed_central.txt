Within the BM, the primary lineage-specific progeny of MSCs are stromal fibroblasts ([@b12-btt-2-699]; [@b3-btt-2-699]). It is not surprising then that SDF-1α is important in the biology of MSCs. Expression of the principal SDF-1α receptor, CXCR4, has been demonstrated on MSCs, where it has been shown to mediate site-directed homing of MSCs in models of tissue engineering ([@b32-btt-2-699]). In the BM, SDF-1α is vital to the hematopoietic supportive function that MSCs exert to maintain proper hematopoeisis (Van Overstraeten et al 2006).

As mentioned earlier, preconditioning MSCs with cytokines such as IL-1β and TNFα increased the migratory capacity of the cells ([@b30-btt-2-699]; [@b33-btt-2-699]). However, these enhancing effects were shown to be independent of SDF-1α, and were instead mediated by other chemokines ([@b30-btt-2-699]).

In general, the clinical relevance of SDF-1α in the success of MSC therapies is positive, since SDF-1α gradients help MSCs home to sites of tissue injury ([@b4-btt-2-699]). In theory, MSCs could be administered systemically and allowed to respond to SDF-1α gradients for proper delivery to the target tissue. Once at the site of injury, MSCs themselves could serve as a source of SDF-1α ([@b38-btt-2-699]). Expression of SDF-1α by MSCs has been shown to promote survival of cardiac myocytes after myocardial infarction in rats ([@b38-btt-2-699]).

However, SDF-1α is also a potent lymphocyte chemoattractant ([@b4-btt-2-699]). Excess production of SDF-1α within the microenvironment could potentially lead to increased immune cell infiltration and transplant rejection. SDF-1α may be less beneficial or even deleterious in therapies transplanting cells partly or fully differentiated from MSCs. For instance, SDF-1α has been shown to increase the proliferation of neural progenitor cells dissociated from rat cortex ([@b16-btt-2-699]). Comparing these results to the example of MSC neuronal transdifferentiation discussed throughout this review, excess SDF-1α might impede the final steps

Adult volunteers between the ages of 18 and 65 were recruited for this study. Patients meeting DSM-IV diagnosis of MDD without other Axis 1 conditions, such as bipolar disorder, psychosis, or substance dependence (determined using the Standard Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Health Disorders---Fourth Edition)^[@CR27]^ were included. Patients with a clinically significant risk of suicidal behaviour, or a need for urgent drug treatment were excluded. Healthy controls without a current or past history of Axis I disorders on DSM-IV were included. Any potential subject with contraindications to magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, who was pregnant or breastfeeding, or was involved in a research project during the month preceding the study was excluded from the study sample as well.

Mood ratings were measured using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D)^[@CR28]^ and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)^[@CR29]^, while anxiety ratings were scored using the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory (STAI)^[@CR30]^. We also measured anhedonia with the Snaith--Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS)^[@CR31]^ and fatigue with the Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFS)^[@CR31],[@CR32]^. Collectively, these scores were used to capture illness severity of a given subject. Childhood trauma was measured using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ)^[@CR33]^. All subjects included in this study gave informed written consent, and this study was approved by the National Research Ethics Service Committee (NRES), South-Central Oxford B.

Venous blood samples were taken at the time of scanning. Five millilitres were assayed on the same day for high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP), using a standard immunoturbidimetric method on an Abbott c 16 000 automatic chemistry analyzer (Abbott Diagnostics, Maidenhead, UK). Another 5 mL were collected into an EDTA tube, centrifuged for 10 min at 1250*×g* within 30 min to separate plasma, which was then stored at −30 °C until assay. On study completion, the plasma samples were transferred in a single batch, in unlinked anonymized form, for Human IL-6 Immunoassay using a Quantikine® HS (high sensitivity) ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK). The assay was performed in duplicates.

Salivary cortisol was assayed in duplicate using a commercial,

RMH-1 and HIM-6/ BLM Pachytene Foci Are Doublets/Elongated Structures {#sec009}
---------------------------------------------------------------------

We investigated the foci structure of RMH-1 and HIM-6 foci using structured illumination microscopy (SIM). Both in mid pachytene and late pachytene, RMH-1 and HIM-6 signals were resolved into more complex structures ([Fig 6](#pbio.1002412.g006){ref-type="fig"}). In mid pachytene, we observed foci that clearly exhibit a doublet structure and foci that show an elongated shape ([Fig 6A and 6B](#pbio.1002412.g006){ref-type="fig"}). In late pachytene, RMH-1 and HIM-6 appear even more clearly as doublets ([Fig 6C--6E](#pbio.1002412.g006){ref-type="fig"}). In both pachytene stages, we hypothesize that RMH-1 and HIM-6 foci mark similar recombination intermediates. The doublet structure is likely easier to observe in late foci as RMH-1 protein accumulates during pachytene progression, leading to larger foci in late pachytene. We measured the average distance between the foci peak in the three-dimensional stacks as an average of 227 +/- 46 nm. Interestingly, in *Drosophila*, the size of a recombination nodule has been estimated to around 100 nm \[[@pbio.1002412.ref072]\]. It has also been shown that 1 kb of B-form DNA is 340 nm in length. We conclude that the structure we describe here is on an appropriate scale for flanking dHJs. We also observed that the late pachytene HIM-6 doublet structures flank a COSA-1 focus in the wild type ([Fig 6F](#pbio.1002412.g006){ref-type="fig"}). Interestingly, in the *rmh-1(jf54*) mutant, HIM-6 appears as single foci and not as elongated or doublet structures in late pachytene ([Fig 6G](#pbio.1002412.g006){ref-type="fig"}). This suggests that *rmh-1* is required to concentrate HIM-6 at CO sites and also to organize a complex structure surrounding late recombination intermediates.

Background {#Sec2}
----------

*Toxoplasma gondii* is a ubiquitous protozoan parasite capable of infecting all warm-blooded animals, including humans \[[@CR1]\]. The definitive host, the cat, passes oocysts in its faeces that contaminate the environment where they can remain viable for long periods of time. Intermediate hosts, such as livestock, are infected by ingesting contaminated water or soil and this results in the formation of tissue cysts, containing *T. gondii,* that can remain viable for the lifetime of the host \[[@CR2]\]. Although most infections in small ruminants are asymptomatic there can be abortions, foetal mummification, stillbirths and birth of weak lambs/kids \[[@CR3]\]. Humans can become infected with *T. gondii* by ingesting tissue cysts from meat, or oocysts from contaminated food or water. Most infections are asymptomatic; however, there can be severe neurological and pulmonary signs in immunosuppressed people. Infections of a foetus during pregnancy can result in retinochoroiditis and neurological abnormalities \[[@CR4]\].

Small ruminants are a very important source of domestic meat production in the Caribbean \[[@CR5]\]. Generally, the Caribbean is a net importer of meat, particularly beef and poultry; however, the demand for sheep and goat meat (both referred to as mutton) is high, and any meat produced locally is consumed by the local population and occasionally by foreign tourists interested in tasting local cuisine \[[@CR5]\].

The prevalence of *T. gondii* in food animals is higher in pigs, sheep and goats than in cattle \[[@CR6], [@CR7]\], and varies worldwide \[[@CR8]\]. There are few studies on the prevalence of *T. gondii* in livestock animals in the Caribbean. In Trinidad, a study of animals at slaughter reported *T. gondii* antibodies in 42.9% of goats and 5.5% of pigs \[[@CR9]\]. In a more recent study, 23.1% of pigs, 44.1% of sheep, 42.8% of goats and 8.4% of cattle in Grenada and Carriacou were seropositive for *T. gondii* \[[@CR10]\].

To provide further data on the epidemiology of *T. gondii* in small ruminants in the Caribbean, we tested sheep and goats from four different islands for reactive

Extensive data have shown that, in healthy pre-menopausal and postmenopausal women, total body fat is positively related to bone mineral density, an important and measurable determinant of fracture risk,[@b26-dmso-4-273]--[@b27-dmso-4-273] that high body weight (or body mass index) is correlated with high bone mineral density, and that decreased body weight leads to bone loss.[@b28-dmso-4-273]--[@b32-dmso-4-273] Furthermore, fat mass, the most important index of obesity, has been demonstrated to have a similarly beneficial effect, leading to an increase in bone mass,[@b17-dmso-4-273],[@b33-dmso-4-273] while a beneficial effect of fat mass on bone mineral density is confirmed in white women but not in white men.[@b34-dmso-4-273]

Although these data indicate that obesity exerts a protective effect on bone tissue, more recent studies have described an opposite event. In particular, although cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have shown that bone mass is positively related to body weight and body mass index, there are controversial issues as to whether lean mass or fat mass might be the most important determinant of bone mineral density.[@b6-dmso-4-273] In particular, the evidence suggests an inverse relationship between obesity and osteoporosis depending on how obesity is defined. In the studies where obesity is defined on the basis of body mass index or body weight, obesity appears to act as a protective factor against bone loss and fractures; however, if obesity is considered as a percentage of body fat and distribution, as in the study published by Zhao et al in a Chinese population,[@b11-dmso-4-273] it becomes a risk factor for osteoporosis.

In particular, there are data indicating that women with a high body mass index (25--29.9 kg/m^2^) are protected from osteoporosis, but there is increasing evidence conflicting with this observation, suggesting that obesity (body mass index \> 30) might actually interfere with bone health.[@b11-dmso-4-273]

In accordance with the data reported by Zhao et al,[@b11-dmso-4-273] Hsu et al showed that matching of Chinese subjects by body mass index, across 5 kg strata of body weight, revealed a negative relationship between fat and bone mass, and the risk of osteoporosis and nonspinal fractures was significantly higher for subjects

CD28 is required for the thymic generation and peripheral maintenance of a functional Treg population. CD4+ Foxp3+ Tregs are key negative regulators of T cell-mediated immunity and are required for the control of spontaneous responses to self through several mechanisms ([@B59], [@B60]). Contact-mediated suppression relies on CTLA-4 interactions with its ligands and is discussed in detail below. Bystander suppression is mediated by suppressive cytokines, mainly IL-10 ([@B61]) and TGF-β ([@B62]) produced by activated Tregs, and by induction of cytokine starvation in target cells by IL-2 clearance ([@B63]). B7 ligand recognition plays an important role in Treg development and function, summarized in Table [1](#T1){ref-type="table"}. In CD28-deficient NOD mice, the percentage of peripheral Tregs is strongly reduced ([@B64]). Similar reductions are observed in NOD mice lacking both CD80 and CD86, leading to the conclusion that the B7--CD28 interaction is required for the formation of the full Treg repertoire. The reduction in the percentage of Tregs in NOD mice treated with B7-blocking CTLA-4-Ig correlates with a higher incidence of spontaneous autoimmune diabetes ([@B64]). Subsequent analysis revealed that Treg deficiency in CD28^−/−^ mice can be traced back to thymic development. The percentage of Treg precursors among thymic CD4 single-positive cells is significantly reduced in CD28^−/−^ mice as well as in NOD mice injected with anti-CD80 and CD86 antibodies ([@B65]), and in B7 double knockout mice ([@B66]). Peripheral homeostatic expansion of Tregs -- but not effector T cells -- in normal syngeneic hosts is also strongly suppressed by anti-CD80 and CD86 antibodies ([@B66]). A mechanistic explanation for the thymic requirement for CD28 was proposed by Tai et al. ([@B67]) who examined the consequences of CD28 deletion in a TCR-transgenic model. Mice expressing the AND TCR and its agonist ligand, a pigeon cytochrome *c* peptide, were found to effectively induce thymic Tregs only in the presence of CD28. This means that while a strong selection signal through TCR is indeed required ([@B68]), it is not sufficient for the full initiation of the agonist selection program leading to the generation of Tregs, and that a co-stimulatory signal from mTEC-expressed B7 molecules through CD28 is also required. It is noteworthy that a

RPS3 induces maturation and activation of mouse BMDCs, THP-1 cells, and human DCs {#Sec15}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To confirm the effects of RPS3 which binds to TLR4, we used recombinant RPS3 from E.coli in all experiments due to productivity and convenience. Firstly, we determined the effects of RPS3 on mouse BMDCs by characterizing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and IFN-β. The levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, and IFN-β were all significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner in DCs treated with RPS3 compared to untreated DCs (Fig. [2](#Fig2){ref-type="fig"}A). In addition, the expression levels of co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, CD86, and MHC class I were also increased in DCs treated with RPS3 compared to untreated DCs (Fig. [2](#Fig2){ref-type="fig"}B). To evaluate the activation of signaling pathways, mouse BMDCs were treated with RPS3 in a time course over an hour. The levels of p-ERK, p-P38, and p-JNK and p-AKT were all found to be elevated (Fig. [2](#Fig2){ref-type="fig"}C). To assess NF-κB activation, we measured the degradation of the inhibitory IκB-α protein (Fig. [2](#Fig2){ref-type="fig"}C). The activation of DCS by RPS3 was carried out using protein purified from *E. coli* in such a way that endotoxins were removed from the preparation. As a negative control, GFP prepared in an identical manner was used; LPS was used as a positive control since it is a known TLR4 ligand. We assessed LPS contamination of the RPS3 protein preparation used to treat DCs and showed that it was not as a result of endotoxin contamination from *E. coli*. Treatment with polymyxin B (PMB) decreased the effects of LPS in DCs, whereas the effects of RPS3 in DCs were not affected but instead were decreased by proteinase K treatment (Additional File [2](#MOESM2){ref-type="media"}: Figure S4). These results indicate that RPS3 can induce the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, increase the expression of co-stimulatory molecules, and activate signaling pathways in mouse BMD

Literature review provided no references of human amniotic membrane used as a biologic dressing to aid reconstruction of the nose. Evidence demonstrating efficacy in epithelialization and pain reduction along with anti-inflammatory and anti-scarring properties pointed to human amniotic membrane as an ideal option for nasal reconstruction \[[@rjw174C6]--[@rjw174C8]\]. This case report presents a patient in which dehydrated human amniotic membrane (EpiFix; MiMedex Group, Inc., Kennesaw, GA) was used to facilitate healing of the lower third of the nose.

Case Presentation {#rjw174s2}
=================

A 56-year-old male presented status post assault with human bites to the tip of his nose, left ala, right ear and first digit of his left hand. He denied nasal obstruction and no facial fractures were associated. He denied of consciousness and reported no other trauma. Past medical history was significant for hypertension controlled with Lisinopril, diet and exercise. Patient denied tobacco and illicit drug use but reported occasional alcohol use. Physical exam revealed a well-developed, well-nourished adult Caucasian male in no acute distress. There was a 22 × 18 mm full thickness skin and subcutaneous tissue defect present on the nasal tip. The columella and left ala were similarly involved. The perichondrium and nasal cartilage remained intact and undamaged. Nasopharyngoscopy with a zero degree nasopharyngoscope revealed a slight right septal deviation without evidence of intranasal trauma, discharge or mucosal bleeding. Involvement of the patient\'s right auricular pinna was very superficial and treatment was deferred. No facial lacerations, bony abnormalities or palpatory tenderness was appreciated. Facial weakness and neurologic deficits were also no appreciated. Bilateral involvement of the hands and upper extremities also appeared very superficial and treatment was deferred.

Debridement of the nasal tip and adjacent structures was performed using standard sterile technique and local anesthesia. The defect measured 25 × 20 mm following debridement and the perichondrium and nasal cartilage was confirmed intact and without evidence of disease or injury. Dehydrated human amniotic membrane was fashioned to the dimensions of the defect and affixed to the wound. The allograft did not overly the native integument. Suture fixation was deferred. Sterile wet to dry dressing was applied and the patient was instructed to avoid recurrent trauma to, and washing of,

So far, we have analysed the *co-occurrence* of financial institutions in the set of the 25 best ranked institutions, weighted by their ranks. These ranks were based on their activities, i.e., *total derivatives*. As a result, we could reconstruct the weighted network of counterparty risk which also reflects the importance of the nodes. This network was reconstructed (a) on a time resolution of one quarter year, to show the dynamics of the network (Fig D in [S1 Appendix](#pone.0136638.s001){ref-type="supplementary-material"}), and (b) on the time aggregated level ([Fig 8](#pone.0136638.g008){ref-type="fig"}).

To further analyse the mutual dependence between the best ranked institutions, we now calculate different correlations. The network of counterparty risk has revealed how the co-occurrence changes over time. But will the OTC derivatives of institution *i* increase, or decrease, if the same measure of institution *j* increases? Answering this question allows some more refined conclusions about the dependence between these institutions.

The simplest measure is the *Pearson correlation coefficient* *ρ*, which points to a *linear* dependence between two variables. As explained above, for each institution *i* we have a dataset **a** ~*i*~ = {*a* ~*i*~(1), *a* ~*i*~(2), ..., *a* ~*i*~(*T*)} available which contains up to *T* entries about its quarterly activity *a* ~*i*~(*t*) measured by means of its total derivatives. We recall that some of these entries are zero whenever institution *i* was not listed among the best 25 ranked. Let us define the mean value and the standard deviation of each of these samples as: $${\overline{a}}_{i} = \frac{1}{T}\sum\limits_{t = 1}^{T}a_{i}\left( t \right)\;; s_{i}^{a} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{T - 1}\sum_{t = 1}^{T}\left\lbrack a_{i}\left( t \right) - {\overline{a}}_{i} \right\rbrack^{2}}.$$ The Pearson correlation coefficient with respect to the variable *a* is then defined as $$\rho_{ij}^{a} = \frac{1}{T - 1}\sum\limits_{t = 1}^{T}\mspace{180

Case report
===========

Early on October 2014, a 45-year-old woman was presented at our outpatient gynecology clinic with sudden lower pelvic discomfort and vaginal bleeding symptoms. The patient had a history of hysterectomy 13 months ago due to symptomatic multiple leiomyomas and adenomyosis.

The previous surgery was conducted as a single-port approach laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy in July 2013. Surgical findings showed an enlarged uterus of about a 14 weeks gestational age size. Both adnexa were grossly normal in appearance and the peritoneum was clear with no signs of endometriosis. The vaginal vault was sutured vaginally using a 1-0 vicryl. No complications were observed during the postoperative period and the patient was discharged as scheduled. The histology of the uterus was confirmed as adenomyosis with leiomyoma with a secretory phase endometrium. Follow up examinations at 3 and 6 months showed no complications and thus no additional follow-ups were required afterwards.

However on October 2014, after more than a year from her last check up, the patient appeared at our clinic complaining of sudden pelvic discomfort and vaginal bleeding symptoms. Pelvic examinations showed no signs of active bleeding. Yet, a dark wine colored papule suggestive of a small hematoma or ulcerative lesion was observed upon the previous operative vaginal vault site ([Fig. 1.](#F1){ref-type="fig"}).

Her vitals were stable and she showed no signs of fever. The pain was tolerable during manipulation of the vault site. The ulcerative lesion was suspected as an old hematoma or granulation formation of the previous hysterectomy vault or possibly due to an unknown malignancy or cancerous change.

For further investigation, a quick excision biopsy using sharp scissors was performed under local anesthesia at the outpatient operation room. Bleeding control was done with sutures and tampon gauzes were inserted intravaginally. Nevertheless, the patient returned to the clinic within a few hours with excessive bleeding. Upon re-examination, active bleeding was visible at the vault site, and additional maneuvers including sutures were performed for hemostasis.

The pathology reports showed normal vaginal tissue with non-specific loss of surface epithelium and subepithelial hemorrhage. The diagnosis was uncertain but any kind of malignancy could be ruled out.

Ten days later, the patient revisited our clinic with another incidence of massive vaginal bleeding with large clots. She looked pale and anemic in general with vital signs showing an increased pulse with a decreased blood

Genomic DNA was isolated from a fresh culture biomass of Achromobacter sp. B7 grown on tryptic soy agar (TSA) and lysed in EDTA-saline buffer (0.15 M NaCl, 0.01 M EDTA, pH 8.0) with 10 mg ml^−1^ lysozyme for 2 h at 37°C. Genomic DNA was isolated with the Promega Wizard kit and a modified Marmur procedure ([@B5]). DNA was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 system (GATC Biotech, Germany), generating 10,102,770 pair-end reads of 150 bp each and yielding a total of 1,525.5 Mb. Standard genomic library preparation was performed with an optimized protocol, and standard Illumina adapter sequences were used. Sequence reads were trimmed, using Sickle (version 1.33) ([@B6]), with a Phred quality score threshold of 30. A subset of 6,666,666 high-quality paired-end reads with a total of 904,208,607 bp was obtained. Additionally, DNA was sequenced with an Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION instrument. A library was prepared with the ONT rapid barcoding kit (SQK-RBK004). Albacore version 2.1.10 was used for base calling, which yielded a total of 2,260 Mb distributed in 217,643 reads. The subsets of Illumina paired-end reads (904 Mb) and base-called Nanopore reads (2,260 Mb) were used to perform a hybrid assembly, using hybridSPAdes from SPAdes version 3.11.1 ([@B7], [@B8]). The hybrid assembly resulted in a final closed and complete chromosome sequence of 6,236,552 bp with a G+C content of 64.8%.

The B7 genome was annotated with the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) version 4.6 ([@B9]), which identified 5,578 coding sequences and 57 tRNAs. After 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses, A. spanius DSM 23806 was the most closely related species (100% identity). Analysis by average nucleotide identity based on BLAST (ANIb) ([@B10]), using JSpeciesWS version 3.0.20 ([@B11]), with A. piechaudii NBRC 102461^T^, A. spanius DSM 23806 ^T^, and

Three-fourths of the population came from Afghanistan, while the remaining came from Somalia and Iran ([table 1](#T1){ref-type="table"}). There were no significant differences between the countries of origin and the variables included in this article. A minority (36%) were able to read in their own language. Mean number of serious lifetime events experienced was 6.1 (SD 2.3), range 1--11. Most of the participants (96%) had experienced at least one of the serious life events listed. The most frequently reported experiences were life-threatening events (82%), physical abuse (78%) and loss of a close relative (78%). The official age assessment found a mean age of 18.4 years (SD 2.4), range 15--28, which meant that 72 (56%) participants were considered to be adults. Of this 'adult' group, 36 participants were allowed to stay at the care centres for adolescents, while the rest had to move to centres for adults. None of the participants received psychiatric treatment during the study. Overall, there were no significant changes in the level of symptoms within the study period (p≥0.084), neither for HSCL ([table 2](#T2){ref-type="table"}) nor for PTSS.

The unmasked localized reconstruction using the sub-particles of the vertex region was performed to determine the orientation of P2 with respect to the viral capsid and avoid any bias by masking. From the localized reconstruction, we now know that the P2 protein is on average present only on 2 vertices of the viral particle. We can also notice that all the vertices display the presence of P5 that would also contribute to map densities (i.e., the highly flexible C-terminal regions with the collagen-like triple helix and the knob domain that are not resolved in the icosahedrally averaged map used to generate the projection for signal subtraction) during the focused classification. These issues along with the caveat mentioned by the reviewers will significantly reduce the resolution. By applying a focus mask around the P2 protein to address some of the issues, we would essentially bias the very orientation that we plan to determine. Hence, we have avoided using whole particles for focused classification of P2. Instead, we provide the P2 map from the masked classification without re-alignment of sub-particles whose orientation was previously determined without using a mask from localized reconstruction. This ensures that the features observed are not due to masking. We have provided two images, one with the map generated by re-aligned sub-particles (previously submitted) and another with a masked map without realignment (submitted here as part of the supporting files). We believe that the Figure 5, currently in the manuscript, illustrates the structure of the vertex complex, best.

We do agree that having a resolution beyond 3 Å for an asymmetric reconstruction would be better to access the heteropentameric nature of the penton. The resolution of the maps from the localized reconstruction and focused classification should be sufficient to assess the secondary structure and domain fit for the proteins P31, P5 N-terminal domain and P2.

The first randomized controlled trial (RCT) measuring the effect of the Sonas programme was conducted in 2003 by Jackson et al. \[[@B18]\]. All 75 participants were randomly selected to either attend a weekly Sonas session for 8 weeks or be part of the control group where the participants received standard care. No significant differences were found between the groups in relation to aggression, agitation, depression or cognitive impairment. A recent pilot RCT \[[@B15]\] included 36 residents with moderate to severe dementia, of whom 20 participated in Sonas sessions twice weekly over a period of 7 weeks; no statistically significant differences in depression, anxiety, communication, and QoL were reported. However, there was some improvement for both groups in relation to depression and anxiety, where the control group demonstrated greater improvement than the Sonas group. Further, the Sonas group demonstrated an improvement in communication ability and QoL, as well as a greater reduction in behavioural and mood disturbance than the control group.

The need for high-quality research investigating psychosocial interventions for older people with dementia has been emphasized \[[@B19]\]. In addition, only few studies have investigated the effectiveness of techniques to improve communication for people with dementia, which is of importance as communication is essential for social life of people regardless of cognitive function \[[@B20]\]. With just few published studies examining the effect of the Sonas programme, some showing methodological limitations, short duration and small sample sizes, the overall aim of this study was to examine the effect of the Sonas programme on communication ability for people with moderate to severe dementia living in a nursing home. The secondary aim was to explore if any effect could be related to cognitive function and different aspects of communication.

Study Design {#sec2_1}
------------

The study is an RCT where the participants were assigned to 1 of the 3 groups for 24 weeks: (1) the Sonas programme, (2) the reading group, and (3) standard care. The reading group was set up in order to rule out the possibility that an effect of attending the Sonas sessions could be caused by the attention given by staff leading the group, rather than the actual Sonas programme. The study took place from April to October 2014. Data collection was carried out at baseline (T0) before randomization, and after

Perceived depressive symptom severity was not always congruent with PHQ-9 scores at inclusion. Both over- and underestimation by the PHQ-9 of depression severity was perceived. Even though the PHQ-9 is a validated instrument to screen for mild depression in the chronically ill using a cut-off of 6 \[[@CR47], [@CR48]\], our findings could indicate that, in these specific long-term conditions, the discriminative properties of this method were not optimal. A recent study in a population of patients with DM2/CHD, found optimal cut-off scores for minor and major depression to be within a small range of 8 and 10 respectively \[[@CR57]\]. This suggests that the PHQ-9 might not be specific enough to distinguish minor from major depression for scores in this range. A higher cut-off score of 8 might be necessary in order not to over-diagnose mild depression in patients with DM2/CHD, as symptom of the somatic diseases and depression, like fatigue and altered appetite, can overlap. Also, there is an association between depressive symptoms and distress related to long-term conditions \[[@CR58]\], such as diabetes distress \[[@CR59], [@CR60]\]. A complex finding of our study was that even though patients explained they felt mildly to moderately depressed, they independently labelled their mental state differently than 'depression'. It seems likely that patients actually do suffer from depressive symptoms, but prefer using different labels like 'stress' or 'sleeping disorders', as they perceive these as less stigmatizing than 'depression'. However, since the specificity of the PHQ-9 with a cut-off of 6 was found to be only 55% \[[@CR57]\], our findings raise questions over whether it discriminates enough between mild depression and mild forms of other psychological problems, like anxiety, burn-out or sleeping disorders.

In this study, many patients expressed both the heavy burden of sleeping problems and the wish to alleviate it. Problems with sleeping are classic symptoms of depression, but the associations between disturbed sleep and depression \[[@CR61]\] or long-term conditions \[[@CR62]\], like CHD and DM2, have also been well established. While the underlying mechanisms of the relationships between these conditions and their implications for rational therapeutics should be further explored \[[@CR63]\], addressing sleeping problems seems a promising starting point for the delivery of mental health care for most patients with depressive symptoms.

We found that all three groups (PTSD, PTSD+DS and controls) differed significantly in terms of CAPS-IV, CTQ, BDI, MDI-total, and MDI depersonalization/derealization average scores. The PTSD+DS group exhibited the highest scores among these clinical variables as compared to the PTSD and control groups (see Supplemental Material Table s1 and [Table 1](#tbl0001){ref-type="table"}), where the PTSD group had higher scores on these clinical variables as compared to the control group only.

With regard to state-based clinical measures assessed at the time of the fMRI scan, the PTSD+DS group scored significantly higher on state dissociation scores as measured by the RSDI-dissociation subscale as compared to the PTSD group (see Supplemental Material Table s1 and [Table 1](#tbl0001){ref-type="table"}). By contrast, scores for state anxiety (STAI) and reliving symptoms (RSDI scale) did not differ significantly between the PTSD and PTSD+DS groups. However, all state-based clinical measures were significantly higher in the PTSD and PTSD+DS groups as compared to the healthy control group, which is a common finding in the PTSD literature and suggests active psychopathology even at rest among PTSD patients (also see [@bib0054]; [@bib0091]; [@bib0076]). Dissociative symptoms collected prior to the scan (MDI depersonalization/derealization averages) and during the scan (RSDI depersonalization/derealization averages) were highly correlated (*r* = 0.70, *p* \<0.001).

The relation between medication use frequency and group was non-significant. MDD diagnosis was significantly more frequent in the PTSD+DS group as compared to the PTSD group (*p* \< .001), where it has been suggested that higher scores of depression and PTSD symptom severity are associated with the dissociative subtype of PTSD ([@bib0128]; [@bib0050]). Finally, when MDD diagnosis was used as a covariate in Part A, regional clusters did not change, albeit the magnitude of statistical significance decreased marginally. Similarly, medication use was not found to significantly affect results when used as a covariate. Our analysis regarding motion outliers yielded non-significant results when comparing observed outlier frequencies across groups X^2^ (2, *N*

For violations of sphericity, a Huynh-Feldt correction procedure was applied. Least significant difference (LSD) test was performed for all multiple comparisons. For the sake of brevity, uncorrected degrees of freedom were reported. All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS package.

Result and Discussion
---------------------

For the subjective pleasantness ratings, a one-way ANOVA showed a significant effect of odor, *F*(2,46) = 72.22, *p* \< 0.001, $\eta_{p}^{2}$ = 0.758. Pairwise comparisons revealed that the smell of lemon (*M* = 7.08, *SE* = 0.27) was rated as significantly more pleasant than water (*M* = 4.75, *SE* = 0.16, *p* \< 0.001) and water, in turn, was rated more pleasant than pyridine (*M* = 2.92, *SE* = 0.26, *p* \< 0.001).

The ANOVA on gaze cone width showed that the main effect of odor condition was not significant, *F*(2,36) = 0.76, *p* = 0.473, $\eta_{p}^{2}$ = 0.041, and there was no main effect of gaze direction (*p* = 0.339) or interaction between odor condition and gaze direction (*p* = 0.281) either (see **Figure [2A](#F2){ref-type="fig"}**). The proportions of looking-at-me responses for the nine gaze angles as a function of odor condition are presented in the Supplementary Table [S1](#SM1){ref-type="supplementary-material"}. For the eye contact strength rating data (**Figure [2B](#F2){ref-type="fig"}**), the analysis expectedly showed a main effect of gaze angle, *F*(4,72) = 188.50, *p* \< 0.001, $\eta_{p}^{2}$ = 0.913. The strength of the eye contact feeling decreased with larger deviations of gaze angle from the direct gaze. Again, there was no main effect of odor condition or gaze direction (*p* = 0.754 and *p* = 0.284, respectively) or interactions involving odor condition, gaze angle, and gaze direction (*p* = 0.551, *p* = 0.640, *p* = 0.689,

Discussion {#sec1-3}
==========

Bilateral PFEDH is uncommon and its supratentorial extension is even rare.\[[@ref1]\] According to the speed of the clinical picture development, PFEDH can be divided into acute (\<24 hours), subacute (2-7 days) or chronic (\>7 days), depending on the onset of symptoms. The acute ones are caused by arterial injuries and chronic or subacute are secondary to venous injuries. However, in the index case there was venous sinus tear seen and the presentation was acute. Occipital bone fractures or diastasis of lambdoid sutures is seen in 40-86%.\[[@ref4]\] Swelling of soft tissue in occipital and retromastoid region is seen in almost all the patients.\[[@ref4]\] Distatic fracture of the lambdoid suture is usually associated with more complicated venous sinus injury making surgery more difficult.\[[@ref5]\]

Patients with occipital trauma should be evaluated immediately using cranial CT scans, and those having mass effect should be immediately treated surgically. PFEDH has a higher mortality than supratentorial localization. However, early diagnosis of PFEDH by urgent CT scan and prompt surgical evacuation provide excellent recovery.\[[@ref2]\] Patients with PFEDH with no mass effect, serial CT scanning is recommended especially in first 24 hours as repeat CT picks up delayed PFEDH even when the initial CT may be negative.\[[@ref1][@ref2][@ref6]\]

Classically, first one burr hole in the occipital region is made, immediately evacuating the hematoma from this burr hole, then performing the craniectomy. Bilateral or unilateral suboccipital craniectomy has been the standard approach.\[[@ref1]\] Strong dural attachment over the midline has been cited as the reason for bilateral PFEDH without continuity between the haematomas.\[[@ref3]\]

It is important to define mortality and morbidity risk factors in patients with PFEDH. In the previous studies, the risk factors were mentioned as pediatric age group, supr

Most subjects (54%) reported sleeping for four to six hours per day, and 41% reported sleeping for seven to nine hours per day. Only 3% reported sleeping for more than nine hours per day, whereas 2% reported sleeping for three or fewer hours per day. Assessments of participants' knowledge about the number of hours of sleep needed per day showed that the majority (82%) regarded that sleep for seven to nine hours was needed, with 14% reporting that four to six hours per day were needed (Table [4](#TAB4){ref-type="table"}). Only 4% reported that sleep for more than nine hours per day was needed, and only 0.2% reported that with three or fewer hours were required. About 70% of the respondents reported that the time they slept was sufficient for performing daily activities without difficulties, whereas 30% did not. Assessment of participants' knowledge of the most important benefits of adequate sleep found that 51% regarded physical benefits, 41% enhanced thinking, 5% reported emotional benefits, and 3% regarded

The terminology used in both these questions was specifically investigated prior to implementation of data collection. The General Register Office for Scotland commissioned Ipsos MORI Scotland to undertake cognitive question testing, to determine whether the questions were answered accurately and willingly by respondents, and what changes if any might be required to improve data quality and/or the acceptability of the response options. Cognitive interviewing is a widely used approach to critically evaluate survey questionnaires.[@R15] It tests the way respondents understand, mentally process and respond to survey materials. It enables researchers to modify survey material to enhance clarity. Retrospective probing was deemed to be the most appropriate of the different techniques available. It involved the interviewer presenting the question, the respondent answering it, and the interviewer then probing for specific information relevant to the question or to the specific answer given (eg, What does this question mean in your own words?). This research was undertaken with 102 participants with a mix of gender and age, both with and without the health conditions and disabilities (including people with more than one of the conditions). This included people with autism, intellectual disabilities, dyslexia, dyspraxia, speech impairment, mental health conditions (both milder and more serious) and other long-term conditions. The results found that the question on general health status functioned well and did not need amendment, as did the questions on long-term conditions, including intellectual disabilities and mental health condition, while the question on autism was redesigned to that listed above in order to more accurately capture the data specifically on autism. Additionally, the response 'no' was amended to 'no condition'. The other questions did not require any modification. Further information can be found at: <http://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/documents/research/2011-census-health-disability-questions.pdf> <http://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/documents/legislation/changes-to-gov-statement-report.pdf>

In Scotland, the term 'learning disability' is synonymous with the international term 'intellectual disabilities'.[@R16]

For 2.6% of the Census returns, information on long-term conditions was not completed. The Census team assumed the most plausible explanation was that the person had no long-term condition but did not see the 'No condition' check box at the end of the question. They

Another major factor which plays a role in patient not giving adequate importance to periodontal therapy requirements is the inability of periodontist to demonstrate in most of the conditions what they have achieved after treatment. For example, in endodontics, patients get relieved of pain after the therapy or gets a new crown which gives him an esthetic look and functional tooth that is so motivating for him to get the treatment. Similarly, in orthodontics, a beautiful smile even after a difficult, costly prolonged treatment of more than one year, is the incentive for which the patient is motivated to take the treatment.

We have nothing much to show as post-operative outcomes in most of the procedures except for few esthetic surgeries. Rather the patients have lot of complaints in this period. And the irony is that the procedures in which we can show results are barely asked for, by patients in Indian clinical practice scenario. The worrying aspect of these esthetic procedures are their unpredictable results. We deal with periodontal diseases in surrogate endpoints like pocket depth, clinical attachment loss, furcation involvement etc., rather than using true endpoints.

We diagnose the periodontal diseases with parameters which are surrogate, we evaluate our treatment success with same surrogate endpoints and in long term we use the same surrogate parameters to determine whether the patient has maintained the oral hygiene or not. The worst part is that we use the same surrogate endpoints even to explain to the patients what has happened at the time of diagnosis, what we plan to do and what can be expected after treatment.

What does patient understand by pocket depth or clinical attachment loss (CAL) or furcation involvement or gingival colour changes at the time of diagnosis. We try to tell them about bone loss which they cannot understand as it is not visible and they are at their imaginative best. How much a radiograph can explain the amount of bone loss to a layman is still a question unanswered. Even after the therapy is over, we evaluate the above mentioned parameters and are very elated if they have improved.

My question is, how does it matter to the patient if pocket depth is reduced or there is a CAL gain or bone gain or improvement in furcation status?

How many patients have we encountered in our practice/departments who have primarily come for the treatment of increased pocket depth or loss of attachment or furcation involvement and want them to be treated. The answer would be none till date.

Patients come with complaint of dirty teeth, bleeding, mobility, recession, halitosis, spacing,

To investigate the possibility of the leaching of active metal species from Au/HT into the reaction mixtures, Au/HT was filtered from the reaction mixture at 50% conversion of 1, and treatment of the filtrate with additional stirring under similar conditions did not give any product. Furthermore, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectral (ICP-AES) analysis revealed no Au species in the filtrates (detection limit: 0.1 ppm). These results clearly proved that no leaching occurred and the deoxygenation proceeded on the Au NPs on HT.

The outstanding catalytic activity of Au NPs encouraged us to investigate the scope of epoxides in the deoxygenation ([Table 2](#molecules-16-08209-t002){ref-type="table"}). Various epoxides were efficiently converted into the corresponding alkenes with over 99% selectivity. Both aromatic and aliphatic epoxides could be deoxygenated. Epoxides having ether and hydroxyl groups were also successfully employed as substrates (Entries 9 and 16). Notably, the reducible C=O bonds of epoxyketones were tolerated in the deoxygenation (Entries 14 and 15). *cis*-Stilbene oxide and *cis*-2,3-epoxyoctane gave (*Z*)/(*E*)-alkene stereoisomers. The selectivities for *cis*-alkenes were 60% and 50%, respectively (Entries 4 and 13).

The supermode in CDRR is based on traditional micro-ring resonance, which is not that fragile. To test the stability of this sensor, a $5\ {nm} \times 5\ {nm}$ square defect is inserted at two different positions of CDRR, respectively, as given in [Figure 11](#sensors-18-00116-f011){ref-type="fig"}b,c. From the corresponding transmission spectrum of mode 2 shown in [Figure 11](#sensors-18-00116-f011){ref-type="fig"}a, the defect on outer (inner) ring only has influence on the resonance of outer (inner) ring, which can make resonant wavelength shift or create new mode. However, the mode 2 still exists with narrow FWHM in both cases, only suffers from little lower absorption or resonant wavelength change. The corresponding distributions $\left| H_{z} \right|$ of mode 2 with defect are presented in [Figure 11](#sensors-18-00116-f011){ref-type="fig"}d,e.

4. Bio-Sensing {#sec4-sensors-18-00116}
==============

Here, the application for bio-sensing is discussed, the same structure parameters are chosen with outer ring radius 350 nm and gap $30~{nm}$, and still only mode 2 is focused. Since water is one of the most common solvents used in chemical and biological applications, it is necessary to test the performance of the sensor in water (*n* = 1.33), as presented in [Figure 12](#sensors-18-00116-f012){ref-type="fig"}a. When considering the concentration of solution can be reflected by the refractive index (RI), a set of different RI values around the water are used to measure the sensitivity and FOM, the transmission spectrum is given in [Figure 12](#sensors-18-00116-f012){ref-type="fig"}b. According to [Figure 12](#sensors-18-00116-f012){ref-type="fig"}c, the sensitivity in the water is 1061 nm/RIU, and the FOM of 193 can be achieved, which can prove that this sensor still has excellent performance in water.

Therefore, such structure can be a sensitive label-free and compact biosensor. A special case for the detection of the DNA hybridization is shown as follows. After the DNA hybridization, i.e., when single strand DNA

Laad et al. (2004) in France analyzed the seasonal variations in the appearance of the stroke and the influence of meteorological factors on their appearance. The study was a population-based Dijon registry of stroke and included 3287 patients from 1985 to 1998. The difference from one season to another was significant only for the total number of strokes, with a minimum from July to September and a maximum in October. Detected are correlations with meteorological data for the total number of strokes. They pointed to the influence of temperature and relative humidity on days with stroke or 1-5 days earlier ([@R10]). In our study, when testing the null hypothesis about the effects of relative air humidity on days with and without CVI's, (where the null hypothesis denies the influence of the facto and working confirms the influence of humidity) compared to the average values of relative humidity is monitored in two months with the highest stroke incidence and four weeks with most strokes within these months, there was no effect of the average relative humidity on the incidence of stroke. It was found only by this test in 2005 the average relative humidity had influence on the incidence of CVI's. The influence of relative humidity showed the increased incidence of stroke and at extreme values: first at a very low average humidity (38%), followed by a very high (98%). The influence of fluctuations in relative humidity is negligible during the day r = 0.07 (7 am to 14 pm), and there is a mild correlation compared to the average humidity of the day r = 0.29 to the emergence of CVI when we include all the cases. In extreme situations, with an increased number of stroke and no significant correlation between relative humidity, but only a mild correlation with changes in the average humidity of the day in relation to the previous day. Fluctuations for all analyzed parameters during the day was analyzed by comparing measurements in the period from 7 am to 14 pm, when it was most strokes during a three-year research and where it is found that there is no significant correlation between relative humidity and CVI's. Given that the measurements made in terms of 7h, 14h and 21h, analyzes were performed in these terms, but without significant results.

6.. CONCLUSIONS
===============

Patients gender in all three years of the study did not significantly influence the incidence of CVI's, women were represented slightly more (1006) or 52.12%, and men 924 or 47.87% of the cases. When testing the existence of statistical differences in CV

Aneurysms of the internal mammary artery (IMAA) are uncommon clinical entities \[[@RJU125C1]\] and usually occur in patients after sternotomy, placement of a central venous catheter or pacemaker leads \[[@RJU125C2]\]. Less common, these aneurysms are associated with vasculitis (e.g. Kawasaki disease \[[@RJU125C3]\]), connective tissue disorders (e.g. Marfan syndrome \[[@RJU125C4]\]), chest wall infections \[[@RJU125C5]\] or atherosclerosis \[[@RJU125C6]\]. However, changes in the structure of the vascular wall at the cellular level such as cystic medial necrosis or hyperplasia lead to loss of elasticity and formation of aneurysms \[[@RJU125C6]\].

Since rupture of IMAA leads to haemothorax and life-threatening conditions, early diagnosis and treatment is indispensable. We here report the case of a 46-year-old man with an idiopathic IMAA.

CASE REPORT {#s2}
===========

A 46-year-old man was presented to the Department of Vascular Surgery with distinct varicosis. In the context of preparation for vein stripping, chest X-ray was performed and revealed a nodular shadow attached to the pleural cupula (Fig. [1](#RJU125F1){ref-type="fig"}). Exact census of the anamnesis revealed increasing surge and numbness of the fingers depending on the load of the arm (comparable to the thoracic outlet syndrome). To further evaluate the nodular shadow on X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax with contrast medium has been drafted. The CT scan revealed a 3.6 × 4.4 cm inhomogeneous tumorous process dorsal of the left clavicle with impression of the neighbouring lung. Furthermore, it was suspected that the tumour infiltrated the left internal jugular and subclavian vein. Therefore, an additional phlebography was initiated. Phlebography confirmed the perceptions of the CT scan, but failed to shed any further light on the nature of the tumour (Fig. [2](#RJU125F2){ref-type="fig"}). Finally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was performed in order to demonstrate the exact origin of the tumour, but also failed to obtain new findings (Fig. [3](#RJU125F3){ref-type="fig"}). Figure 1:

In our study, NP dosimetry was not the primary focus, since we aimed at comparing the NP impact on cells among different labs (and not of NP) using identical cell lines and culture medium, identical NP suspensions with verified colloidal stability. Due to the homogeneity of experimental parameters, the NP effective density, fate and transport behavior were expected to be comparable among all the labs involved.

Interestingly, it turned out in the inter-laboratory experiments that small variations of the transfer process for the SiO~2~ NPs can strongly affect the stability and, hence, aggregation state of the NPs in cell culture medium. It took several rounds of careful testing and refining, until NPs from the same batch had the same properties after re-dispersion in the individual labs. Many of the factors that were found to have a distinct impact on the state of the NPs are often not been considered in similar experiments involving single or fewer laboratories. Specifically, it was observed i. e., that the power of the ultrasonic bath, an incomplete immersion of the centrifuge tubes with the NP in the ultrasonic bath, different centrifugal accelerations, and even the geometry of the centrifuge tubes, i.e. the use of small (1--3 mL) conically shaped centrifuge tubes instead of round bottomed or larger conical ones resulted in substantially aggregated samples with hydrodynamic diameters of up to 1000 nm. The impact of sonication parameters such as power output, frequency and sample volume on nanoparticle agglomeration and stability in liquid dispersions has already been shown by other authors^[@CR28]--[@CR30]^. The observed drastic effect of the container shape on the sonication processes has not been reported so far. Utmost care should also be taken whenever mailing NPs between laboratories by standard mail, as the conditions during transport are frequently uncontrolled and not reproducible, if the carrier is not well selected. Low (less than \<0 °C) and high temperatures (\>40 °C) lead to a distinct alteration of the aqueous dispersion of silica nanoparticles. Only the careful elimination of all thermal impact on the samples leads to reliable results by thoroughly standardizing the transport and dispersion procedures. This allowed us to work with high standard samples. In this context it should also be pointed out that such problems can be strongly related to the individual properties of different NPs: the polymer NPs used in this study showed reproducible properties and excellent colloidal stability already in the first round of shipment to the individual groups indicating that they are less prone to be affected by environmental factors such as

Generell bietet eine Telefonkonferenz den Vorteil, dass die teilweise zeit- und kostenaufwendige An- und Abfahrt wegfällt und somit die zeitlichen und finanziellen Ressourcen aller Teilnehmer effektiver genutzt werden können. Durch standardisierte Arbeitsweise konnte seit Einführung der EpiLag der wöchentliche zeitliche Aufwand bei der Vorbereitung reduziert werden.

Schlussfolgerung {#Sec13}
================

Das Epidemic Intelligence (EI)-Konzept der EpiLag stellt den Teilnehmern Meldungen über Ereignisse aus der indikatorbasierten Surveillance sowie aus der eventbasierten Surveillance aus unterschiedlichen Quellen zur Verfügung. Informationen aus beiden Komponenten können mithilfe der EpiLag beschleunigt weitergegeben und evaluiert werden. Somit können auch Public-Health-Maßnahmen rascher eingeleitet werden. Mit Einführung der EpiLag wurde eine Informationslücke geschlossen.

Die Implementierung eines nationalen EI-Surveillance-Systems sollte spezifisch auf Monitoring und Evaluation von Infektionskrankheiten, die die Gesundheit der Bevölkerung bedrohen, zugeschnitten sein \[[@CR19]\]. Da sich die EpiLag als infektionsepidemiologische Plattform zwischen nationaler Ebene (RKI) und den zuständigen Landesgesundheitsbehörden bewährt hat, könnten auch zwischen den zuständigen Landesgesundheitsbehörden und lokalen Gesundheitsämtern Telefonkonferenzen eingerichtet werden, auf denen die Teilnehmer regelmäßig, strukturiert und zeitnah infektionsepidemiologische Ereignisse diskutieren.

In relative terms, humans and animals use comparable amounts of antimicrobials \[118 mg/PCU and 133 mg/kg, respectively ([@cit0014])\], but given that the biomass of animals raised for food exceeds by far the biomass of humans, new resistant mutations are more likely to arise in animals. Furthermore, a central distinction between animals and humans is the purpose of antimicrobial use. Unlike in humans, antimicrobial use in animals is primarily intended for growth promotion and mass prophylaxis. These uses are often administered both through feed, directly targeting the gut, and in low-dose patterns that promote the evolution of resistance ([@cit0015]). These factors suggest that the food animal reservoir is a greater source of resistance genes than humans. However, the subsequent spread of those genes to humans follows complex pathways, and recent work has highlighted that curtailing antimicrobial use in animals alone will not suffice to contain AMR in humans ([@cit0016]).

GLOBAL SOLUTIONS {#sec2}
================

The use of antimicrobials in food animals could be reduced by 2030 between *9* and 80% with effective policies compared with a business-as-usual target (BAU) of continued growth of the livestock sector with current levels of antimicrobial use (see the graph). This could be achieved either by reducing the quantity of antimicrobial used per animal (targets 1 and 3) or the number of animals that we raise for food (target 2).

*Regulations.* A global regulation putting a cap of 50 mg of antimicrobials per PCU per year, the current global average amount, could reduce total consumption by 64% (target 1A). If only countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and China were to adopt this regulation, the global consumption in 2030 would already be reduced by 60% (target 1B). In the short term, target 1B may be preferred because it would have substantial impact on global consumption without targeting vulnerable farmers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) who rely on the ability to treat livestock for subsistence ([@cit0017]). In some high-income countries, regulatory approaches have achieved substantial reduction in antimicrobial use within a few years and at moderate costs. However, in LMICs, the cost of setting up surveillance

In this study, we show that integrin--tTG complexes are formed inside the cell early during biosynthesis. We were unable to reconstitute integrin interaction with tTG in vitro using purified proteins, most likely because the formation of these complexes involves some as-yet unidentified intracellular intermediate(s) (data not shown). These facts might explain some previous data showing inability of purified tTG added to cells to influence cell adhesion and spreading ([Jones et al. 1997](#Jonesetal1997){ref-type="bib"}). We also generated a truncated tTG mutant tTG\[Δ592-687\] with the deleted fourth (most COOH-terminal) domain and found that although it retained enzymatic and Fn-binding activities, it did not associate with integrins and was not transported to the cell surface (data not shown). These results suggest that integrins might be involved in transporting tTG to the cell surface. Thus, the integrin--tTG interaction established in this work may provide an explanation for the surface localization of tTG reported previously ([Martinez et al. 1994](#Martinezetal1994){ref-type="bib"}; [Aeschlimann et al. 1995](#Aeschlimannetal1995){ref-type="bib"}; [Verderio et al. 1998](#Verderioetal1998){ref-type="bib"}), and consequently, for its effects on cell adhesion and spreading ([Gentile et al. 1992](#Gentileetal1992){ref-type="bib"}; [Jones et al. 1997](#Jonesetal1997){ref-type="bib"}; [Verderio et al. 1998](#Verderioetal1998){ref-type="bib"}).

How does the integrin--tTG interaction promote cell adhesion? Integrins are relatively low affinity receptors for ECM proteins, including Fn. In contrast, tTG binds with high affinity to Fn and its 42-kD fragment ([Turner and Lorand 1989](#TurnerandLorand1989){ref-type="bib"}; [Radek et al. 1993](#Radeketal1993){ref-type="bib"}), and as shown here, forms stable complexes with integrins. The presence of integrin-bound tTG on the surface creates a possibility for cells to use an additional binding site within Fn for the interaction with integrins. This potentially doubles the number of sites in the Fn matrix that cells can access in the process of adhesion and spreading. If the Fn chains are fully extended, as in the case

Time series analysis of average costs for mental disorder {#s2c}
---------------------------------------------------------

A sequence chart of data from 2011 to 2015 showed that hospitalisation admissions for mental disorder presented an upward trend and seasonal variations. [Table 4](#T4){ref-type="table"} shows the models and their performance. The p values of the Ljung-Box test were all over 0.05, indicating that the residuals from the models had no significant autocorrelation, which shows that these models fit the data. The results of forecasting, including observed, fit and forecast values, and credibility intervals are shown in [figure 2](#F2){ref-type="fig"}. The costs for all population, employed population and unemployed population showed increasing trends. By the end of 2030, the average costs per admission per month were estimated to be US\$7394.17 (95% CI US\$6782.24 to 8006.10) for all population, US\$7354.72 (95% CI US\$6635.07 to 8074.36) for employed population and US\$7206.24 (95% CI US\$6222.27 to 8191.02) for unemployed population. Based on the main scenario, the numbers of hospitalisations for mental disorder would be 15 738, making the total expenditure US\$110.95 million (95% CI US\$ 101.32 to 120.58 million) in 2030.

The clearance concept has been used for many years, but the current knowledge remains inadequate for readily designing a targeting system with a clearance step to achieve low blood background. The current investigation focuses on the clearability of biotinylated antibody using avidin as a clearing agent. It is known that avidin does not clear biotinylated antibody completely, but there is no quantitative study as to the exact cause. However, this topic is very important not only for developing a pretargeting technology with clearance, but also for any antibody-based drug for which the background is a concern.

In the current investigation, we employed a model pretargeting system to investigate the *in vivo* chemistry between avidin and biotinylated IgG antibody. The aim of this study is not to develop an improved pretargeting protocol but to understand the clearability of biotinylated antibody by avidin. As such, the pretargeting system is used as a research tool for understanding rather than solely for improved pretargeting technology. In this pretargeting system, the antibody CC49 is conjugated concomitantly with a biotin and a morpholino phosphorodiamidate oligomer (MORF). The biotin functions to bind to the clearing agent of avidin, whereas the MORF is for radiolabeling both *in vivo* and *in vitro*. In contrast to most clearance systems, the current design has avoided the binding competition between the clearing agent and the effector. In this investigation, normal mice are used to focus on the determinants of antibody clearance. Tumor accumulation will not be compromised by antibody clearance as previously concluded (Liu et al., [@B9]).

Materials and methods {#s2}
=====================

The MORF and cMORF (complementary MORF) were custom-synthesized by Gene Tools, LLC (Philomath, OR). Their base sequences and amine derivatization were the same as previously reported (Liu et al., [@B9]). The EZ™ Biotin Quantitation Kit and avidin were from Pierce (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL). The model antiTAG-72 IgG antibody CC49 was prepared by Strategic Biosolutions (Ramona, CA) from its murine hybridoma cell line (a gift from Dr. Jeff Schlom, Center for Cancer Research, NCI, NIH). The biotin-CC49-MORF was synthesized following the reactions illustrated below (Scheme [1](#S1){ref-type="

As some children with NF1 exhibit cognitive deficits and neurodevelopmental delays ([@bib12], [@bib13], [@bib14], [@bib20]), we sought to determine the effects of distinct *NF1* germline mutations on human CNS neuronal function and differentiation. Based on the observation that *Nf1-*mutant (*Nf1+/−*) mice exhibit increased GABAergic tone that contributes to the observed deficits in learning and spatial memory ([@bib5], [@bib6]), we assayed GABA levels in NPC-derived GABAergic neurons ([Figures 3](#fig3){ref-type="fig"}B and [S3](#mmc1){ref-type="supplementary-material"}E). In all *NF1*-mutant neurons (2D cultures), GABA levels were increased (6.5- to 7.8-fold) relative to isogenic control neurons, revealing a shared abnormality in all *NF1*-mutant GABAergic neurons.

In contrast, *NF1-*mutant NPCs in 2D cultures displayed striking differences in dopamine (DA) ([Figure 3](#fig3){ref-type="fig"}C) levels. DA levels were reduced by \>70% in the c.1149C \> A, c.2041C \> T, and c.6619C \> T *NF1* mutants, but by \<40% in the c.1185+1G \> A, c.3431-32_dupGT, c.5425C \> T, and c.6513T \> A *NF1* mutants relative to the control line. These differential effects mirror findings using patient-derived NPCs ([Figures S3](#mmc1){ref-type="supplementary-material"}E and S3F; [Table S1](#mmc1){ref-type="supplementary-material"}) ([@bib2]), as well as mice engineered with NF1 patient-specific *Nf1* germline mutations ([Figure 3](#fig3){ref-type="fig"}D) ([@bib27]). Taken together, these findings demonstrate the existence of differential effects of *NF1* germline mutations on neuronal differentiation *in vitro*.

Nonparametric tests were used throughout the study. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for evaluating the difference between different groups, and Spearman\'s rank correlation coefficient for evaluating correlations. For all tests *P*\< 0.05 was considered significant. Graphpad Prism 4.0 (Graphpad software, La Jolla, CA, USA) was used for statistics.

Patients
--------

Two hundred and thirty-two patients were included. Seventy patients were diagnosed with severe sepsis, 99 patients with sepsis, 43 patients with infection without SIRS, and 20 patients with SIRS without infection. Detailed patient demographic data and diagnoses have been presented elsewhere \[[@B16]\]. Pneumonia and urinary tract infections were common and also overrepresented in the severe sepsis and the sepsis groups. Infected patients without SIRS suffered mostly from upper respiratory infections. The 20 patients with non-infectious SIRS suffered from various diseases such as vasculitis, cardiac failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, pulmonary embolism and pancreatitis. The over-all mortality rate was 3.4%. In the severe sepsis group, the mortality rate was 10%, and out of the 26 patients with septic shock, 19% died.

Plasma levels of Gas6 and sAxl
------------------------------

The plasma concentrations of Gas6 and sAxl were determined in the acutely ill patients who were found to suffer from severe sepsis, sepsis, infections without SIRS, or SIRS without infection (Figure [1](#F1){ref-type="fig"}). When compared to the controls, all patient groups had significantly increased plasma concentrations of Gas6, the median Gas6 concentration being 0.58, 0.50, 0.48 and 0.52 nM for the patient groups and 0.25 nM for the controls. The patients with severe sepsis had significantly increased Gas6 concentrations when compared to the sepsis group (Figure [1a](#F1){ref-type="fig"}). The median plasma sAxl concentrations were 1.19, 1.00, 1.14, 1.29 and 0.99 nM, respectively. There were also statistical differences in sAxl between the controls and the patient groups, but they were not close to the significance levels observed for Gas6. There were several individuals with very high sAxl concentrations in the patient groups, but the differences between the groups were less pronounced than what was found for Gas6 (Figure [1b](#F1){ref-type="fig

Because large weights may cause anomalies in analysis, the weights were assessed for any outliers (Austin and Stuart [@CR1]). We examined the range of weights and decided to trim weights based on distribution. Trimmed weights exclude those observations that had a weight below 1% or above 99% of the distribution of weights for the treatment and control groups separately. This method dropped 1.8% of observations, or 211 of the 11,530 TAY-ASD who had information on receipt of PSE training services. Trimming weights allowed for better overlap between propensity scores of the treatment and control groups.

We then used trimmed weighted logistic regression to model the impact of PSE training on exit with employment, while presenting associations with other covariates as well. There is some discussion as to whether covariates should be included in the outcome model when determining the relationship between the treatment (PSE training services) and outcome (exit with employment). Some suggest that including covariates makes the model doubly robust, allowing for more misspecification and the exclusion of unobserved data while giving the best chance for a properly specified model (Bang and Robins [@CR2]; Hullsiek and Louis [@CR13]). Therefore we included additional covariates in the outcome model. All analyses were conducted in Stata 15, propensity score calculation used the *twang* add on for Stata.

More TAY-ASD were male (83.1%) and white (85.1%) and fewer Hispanic (6.8%) than TAY with IDD (57.0% male, 65.3% white, 10.4% Hispanic) or all other TAY (57.7% male, 73.0% white, 14.8% Hispanic). Fewer TAY-ASD received SSDI (5.7%) or SSI (29.0%) at application than TAY with IDD (SSDI 7.2%, SSI 40.5%) but more than all other TAY (SSDI 3.5%, SSI 14.4%). TAY-ASD spent less time

As much of the world has gone into complete lockdown, woefully unprepared, many countries have turned to South Korea for answers, given its handling of COVID‐19. Rapid and widespread testing, expansive surveillance assemblage and selected quarantine practices are upheld by many countries and public health professionals as superb, a model to adopt. But this is not South Korea's only lesson. Indeed, the world is on edge, scrambling in the here and now, but trying to figure out what happens to sociality going forward.

Five years prior, South Korea found itself mid‐epidemic, facing a different coronavirus. In the aftermath of the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS‐CoV) outbreak in South Korea, queer and HIV/AIDS activists gathered to reflect on the government's and society's treatment of infected individuals as vectors of disease rather than as people. Activists demonstrated how this viropolitical stance mirrored the treatment of people living with HIV/AIDS in South Korea: they became more disease than person, threatening South Korean bodies and making South Korea itself impure.

One particular activist at the gathering stated that South Korea should *not* aim for purity or absolute cleanliness to keep citizens safe. That's impossible, and results in catastrophic social and psychological effects for those deemed impure and unclean. Rather, the activist claimed, we need to find ways for infected and non‐infected individuals to live together, both socially and spatially. When kinship and social relations are predicated on consanguine purity, the mere presence of a virus can potentially upend an entire social and affective system of belonging. For activists, that epidemic embodied, quite literally, fundamental problems in South Korean kinship, social relations and belonging.

The problems of sociality and belonging are now front and centre in the current pandemic, as quarantines, isolation and social distancing have blanketed much of the world. The Herculean global effort of viral containment and cleanliness -- discourses of face masks and social distancing -- though undeniably important, will have lasting effects on how we live with one another. This was the fear of those South Korean activists after the MERS‐CoV outbreak, as what underlined public health discourse and practice were stigmas of impurity.

Living together, then, confronts stigmas of impurity, and purity's embeddedness in sociality and belonging. The virus, facilitating for many a reprioritisation of one's life, allows a broader reassessment

Allelic frequencies were estimated by direct counting. Gene diversity and haplotype diversity were calculated according to Nei \[[@CR16]\]. Comparisons among populations were computed by an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) test. Pairwise values of *Φ*~st~, an analogue of *F*~st~ that takes the evolutionary distance between individual haplotypes into account \[[@CR17], [@CR18]\], were calculated to measure genetic distances between minimal 9-locus haplotypes of the Paiwan and the published data from ten other populations \[[@CR19]--[@CR27]\] from the region (*n* = 2112) with the statistical significance determined by a permutation test (10,000 replicates). We used an implementation of AMOVA provided at the YHRD website \[[@CR28]\]. The DYS389I allele length was obtained by subtracting the shorter allele from the longer allele at DYS389I/II. To illustrate the relationship between populations based on pairwise *Φ*~st,~ an MDS plot was created by using the "Population analysis" tools of the YHRD \[[@CR28]\]. A median-joining network \[[@CR29]\] based on 12-locus Y-STR haplotypes (omitting the complex repeats) was calculated using the NETWORK 2.0b software (available online, [www.fluxus-engineering.come/sharenet.htm](http://www.fluxus-engineering.come/sharenet.htm)).

Results and discussion {#Sec3}
======================

The Y-STR allele frequencies of the Paiwan population are shown in Table S[1](#MOESM1){ref-type=""}. Forensic indices such as the locus diversity and haplotype diversity values were calculated from the allelic frequency for each locus. Of the 17 markers analyzed, DYS385ab showed the greatest degree of diversity, 0.8354, and DYS438 showed the lowest, 0.1014. A total of 135 haplotypes were identified in the 208 individuals studied, of which 102 were unique (Table S[2](#MOESM2){ref-type=""}). The overall observed haplotype diversity reached 0.9922 ± 0.0010, and the discrimination capacity was 0.6490. The most frequent 17-locus haplotype was H122 that was identified in nine individuals (Table S[2](#MOESM2){ref-type=""}). The diversity values were markedly reduced when compared to the major population in Taiwan \[[@CR30]\]. In addition, three intermediate or duplicated alleles at

1.  **What are the histopathologic characteristics of nodular hidradenoma?**

2.  **How does nodular hidradenoma present clinically?**

3.  **What are competing differential diagnoses of nodular hidradenoma?**

4.  **What is the management of nodular hidradenoma?**

DISCUSSION {#S3}
==========

In 1990, Abenoza and Ackerman introduced the poroid hidradenoma (PH) as the fourth subtype of poroma. They described it as a rare, benign adnexal tumor with morphologic characteristics of both a poroma, with poroid and cuticular cells, and a hidradenoma, with both solid and cystic components confined solely within the dermis.[@B1] Recently, it has been proposed to reclassify PH as a subtype of nodular hidradenoma by subdividing nodular hidradenoma into those with eccrine differentiation (PH) and those with apocrine differentiation (clear cell hidradenoma \[CCH\]).[@B2] The pathology of nodular hidradenoma generally shows unencapsulated, eosinophilic, polygonal or fusiform cells often with sclerotic stroma, cystic spaces, and some cellular differentiation.[@B3] In our patient, the pathology was atypical, with the typical features of both poroid and clear cell hidradenoma, in addition to cellular atypia and increased mitotic figures.

The clinical presentation of PH and CCH is similar. It characteristically presents as a solitary, smooth, well circumscribed, reddish to blue papule or nodule of up to a few cm in diameter.[@B4] However, sizes up to 30 cm × 20 cm have been reported in literature. Patients may be asymptomatic or may present with growth, pain, or bleeding.[@B5] They generally occur on the head and neck, with very rare cases on the trunk and extremities. There is a slight female predilection and age of onset is generally more than 40, though reports range from 3 to 93.[@B6] Our patient was a 26-year-old woman, who presented with a growing 2-cm nodule of normal skin color on the medial aspect of the third left toe. To our knowledge, this is the first case of benign nodular hidradenoma ever to be reported in this location.

Because of the nond

To further substantiate the capacity of Ar and Xe to interfere with the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, we measured the capacity of these noble gases to limit the cytosolic redistribution of cytochrome *c* and the subsequent activation of caspase-3 as triggered by STS. To this aim, we employed a 2-color fluorescence staining protocol that allows for the combined assessment of cytochrome *c* subcellular localization (changing from a punctuate, filamentous mitochondrial pattern to a diffuse, uniform distribution in the course of apoptosis) and caspase-3 proteolytic activation (generating a neo-epitope which can be recognized by means of specific monoclonal antibodies). Ar and Xe were indeed able to reduce the frequency of cells that, in response to STS, exhibited the mitochondrial release of cytochrome *c* and the activation of caspase-3 ([Fig. 4](#F4){ref-type="fig"}).

The transmission dynamics of leptospirosis are highly complex, and future research should aim to adopt an eco-epidemiological approach to explore the interactions between humans, animals, and the environment in determining overall infection risk and serovar emergence. Zoonotic diseases are responsible for the majority of emerging infectious diseases \[[@CR29]\], and improved understanding of disease ecology would provide an evidence base to guide the development of tools to help predict the timing and triggers for outbreaks, determine hotspots based on environmental factors, identify subpopulations who are at greatest risk. Such tools will in turn help inform mitigation strategies, early warning systems, and public health interventions to reduce leptospirosis disease burden.

Conclusions {#Sec13}
===========

*Leptospira borgpetersenii* serovar Arborea has been emerging in Queensland since 2001, with increase in case numbers, the proportion of leptospirosis infections attributed to the serovar, as well as expansion of its geographic distribution. Reasons for this emergence are currently unknown, but climatic factors (especially flooding) and environmental change are likely to have played important roles.

Availability of supporting data {#Sec14}
===============================

We are unable to make the raw data freely available because some Queensland postcode areas are very sparsely populated, and cases could potentially be personally identified by age, sex, occupation, and date of diagnosis of leptospirosis. Requests for raw data should be made to the Research and Human Ethics Coordinator (+61 7 3000 9363), Forensic and Scientific Services, Health Support Queensland, Department of Health, Queensland Government.

The average lifetime is in fact comprised of a number of components, including a fast ∼300 fs decay that is consistent with fullerene exciton dissociation due to hole transfer to PTB7 that has to be right next to the fullerene molecules. Slower picosecond decays represent exciton diffusion within regions of PC~71~BM before quenching due to hole transfer to PTB7. As the diffusion coefficient of PC~71~BM has been determined,^[@ref77]^ the morphology can be derived from the time-resolved PL decays. A best-fit is found for a region of pure fullerene material, spherical in shape with a diameter of 60 nm, as shown in [Figure [40](#fig40){ref-type="fig"}](#fig40){ref-type="fig"}A, well below the observed fullerene domain size of 150--200 nm. This led to a further examination of the morphology, and upon closer investigation, a "skin" layer of PTB7 was observed to be covering the active layer ([Figure [40](#fig40){ref-type="fig"}](#fig40){ref-type="fig"}B), similar to some MDMO-PPV and P3HT blends, as briefly mentioned in their respective sections above. This skin layer is polymer-rich in character, blankets the top of the film, and therefore obscures the structural organization of the material beneath it when probed with surface characterization techniques such as AFM. By removing this skin layer with plasma etching, the true morphology of the as-cast blend could then be observed with AFM ([Figure [40](#fig40){ref-type="fig"}](#fig40){ref-type="fig"}C), and the blend displays a remarkable ordered morphology, with the large fullerene domains appearing to actually comprise numerous small fullerene spheres 20--60 nm in size, surrounded by a PTB7-rich matrix.^[@ref77],[@ref276]^

We now control for a vector of socioeconomic covariates to account for other determinants *X* ~*s* , *i* , *t*~ that might affect the probability of a job change. Because job satisfaction is a catch-all variable, we omit it from this specification. Rather, *X* ~*s* , *i* , *t*~ covers gender, age, years of education, marital status, current level of employment, number of children in the household, migrant background, annual number of doctor visits years in the company, actual working hours, and net household income. Although our choice of explanatory variables is primarily driven by the available data in the GSOEP, all these covariates have been shown to be related to turnover. Women, combined with marital status, the level of employment, as well as the number of children in the household, are all associated with kinship responsibilities, which tend to weaken the attachment to the work environment \[[@CR11]\]. Several studies have shown that age has an inverse relation with turnover \[[@CR31]\]. Possible reasons include that older nurses have more firm-specific knowledge and tend to have higher levels of job satisfaction. Higher levels of education often go hand-in-hand with higher turnover rates as they are more likely and able to advance their careers by job changes \[[@CR32], [@CR33]\]. High education is also often associated with better labor-market alternatives \[[@CR34]\]. In much of the economic literature, an inverse relationship between the wage rate or income and the probability of a job change is assumed \[[@CR35], [@CR36]\]. The reason

The proclivity factors for *Prameha* are: *Garbhakala Asatmyata* (intrauterine influence), *Shaithilya* (poor muscle and adipose firmness), *Meda asarata* (dysfunctional adipocytes), *Madhur Agraha* (sweet tooth), *Kapha chaya* (accumulation of sero-mucoids), *Kapha prakopa* (aggravation of biofilms), *Mansavahasrotadushti* (hepatomuscular infiltration), *Meda Vriddhi* (adiposity), *Avyayama* (distaste for exertion), *Divasvapna* (daytime sleep), *Medovahasrotadushti* (adipose tissue inflammation), *Kleda Dushti* (excess of extracellular fluid) etc. The relative significance of each of these factors will depend on the individual's *Prakruti*. Genetic determinants of these factors have to be investigated.

The profiling of *Prakruti* in patients with diabetes has been studied by several groups. In a study from the Central Research Institute (Ayurveda), Jaipur, the frequency of *kapha/* with *vata/pitta* was much more (64 %) than pure *pitta/kapha*/with *vata* (36 %). The response to the treatment with *Nisha amalaki* was also better in patients of *kapha prakruti.* The other study from the Banaras Hindu University showed a strong correlation of blood glucose response to exercise with prakruti. In another study from BHU, an association was found between the type 2 diabetes mellitus and 5, 10-methylene tetrafolate reductase MTHFR C677T. The CT genotype is protective. The study did not show any association of genotypes with the prakruti. MTHFR C677T gene polymorphism, common in the Chinese population, presents a genetic risk factor for diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetic patients. So there is also a need to consider Prakruti genomics for assessing the risk, onset and severity of complications in diabetes. Reverse Pharmacolgy coupled with Ayurgenomics can be applied to detect and measure the variation in drug response correlates vis-à-vis Prakruti.

We studied the effect of regeneration on the sorption properties of the Affi-Gel 15--Dsg3 immunosorbent. Some 100 μL of the serum with a level of activity of 200 RU/mL from a pemphigus patient was added to 20 μl of the sorbent. Suspensions were incubated at room temperature and stirring at 2 rpm for 30 min and precipitated by centrifugation (3 000 rpm, 1 min), the supernatant was removed, the sorbent was regenerated according to the described procedure, and a fresh portion of serum was added. The procedure was repeated 12 times, with residual serum activity being determined in the supernatant after each procedure.

**Preparations for administration to laboratory animals**

Pemphigus was induced in laboratory animals *in vivo* using IgG isolated from a pool of sera from pemphigus vulgaris patients with anti-Dsg3 antibody activity of 12 000 RU/mL.

To prevent the pathogenic effect of anti-desmoglein antibodies *in vivo*, 1 mL of IgG with activity of 12 000 RU/mL was adsorbed onto 500 μL of the synthesized immunosorbent (at room temperature and stirring at 2 rpm for 30 min), followed by precipitation of the sorbent by centrifugation (3 000 rpm, 1 min). Activity of the preparation after sorption was determined in the supernatant.

The animals of the control group were injected with IgG isolated from a pool of blood sera from healthy individuals, as well as with sterile phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.3.

Before administration to laboratory animals, all IgG solutions were sterilized by filtration through Millex filters (Merck Millipore, USA) with a pore size of 0.22 μm.

**Experiments on laboratory animals**

The experiments were performed in the Laboratory of Biological Testing of the Branch of the Shemyakin and Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry -- Pushchino Nursery for Laboratory Animals (Russia, Pushchino). The nursery has AAALAC international accreditation. The system for quality control of laboratory animals production in the Nursery is certified to international requirements of ISO 9001:2008. All the studies on the animals were performed in accordance with the Good Laboratory Practice Rules in the Russian Federation (Order of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation of April 01, 2016 No. 199n "On Approval of the Rules for Good Laboratory Practice"; GOST 53434--009 Principles of Good Laboratory Practice (updated March 01, 2018); Resolution

Umso wichtiger ist es, Patienten mit entsprechenden Risikofaktoren und Komorbiditäten im klinischen Alltag frühzeitig zu identifizieren, um den Besonderheiten dieser Personengruppe besser Rechnung tragen zu können.

Die Therapiedauer der Pneumonie richtet sich insbesondere nach den klinischen Stabilitätskriterien. Bei leichter bis mittelschwerer Pneumonie ist die Dauer der antimikrobiellen Therapie für 5--7 Tage empfohlen. Kürzere Therapien sind bei sehr frühzeitiger klinischer Stabilisierung möglich und können das Auftreten therapieassoziierter Nebenwirkungen, besonders bei älteren Patienten, verhindern. Stabilitätskriterien (wie Normalisierung der Herzfrequenz und des Blutdrucks, Atemfrequenz \< 24/min, Normothermie, Normalisierung des kognitiven Zustands auf Vorniveau und die Besserung der Hypoxämie) sollten mindestens 2 Tage vor Beendigung der antibiotischen Therapie erreicht werden \[[@CR5]\]. Bei der schweren Pneumonie wird die antibiotische Therapie in der Regel ebenfalls nicht länger als sieben Tage durchgeführt. Auch hier ist die klinische Stabilisierung essenziell für die Dauer und Beendigung der Therapie \[[@CR5]\].

So far, most studies on ribosomal protein-p53 signaling have been carried out in U2OS cells and it remains unclear if, or to what extent, this regulatory mechanism operates in other cell types. We found that endogenous RPS9 could be efficiently silenced in U343MG and in U87MG glioma cells whereas no change in RPS9 expression was seen in U1242MG cells upon siRPS9 transfection ([Figure 4A](#pone-0009578-g004){ref-type="fig"}). Of note, is the already low level of RPS9 in untreated U1242MG cells. A clear reduction in the number of cells in cultures treated with siRPS9 relative to siCtrl treated cultures was seen for U87MG, U343MG, and U343MGa Cl2:6 cells but not for U1242MG ([Figure 4B](#pone-0009578-g004){ref-type="fig"}). As a further specificity control, we verified that the RPS9 siRNA oligonucleotide had no effect on mouse NIH3T3 cell proliferation whereas a mouse rps9 siRNA oligo efficiently inhibited the proliferation of these cells ([Figure S1C](#pone.0009578.s001){ref-type="supplementary-material"}). To assess the effect of RPS9 knockdown on the synthesis of mature 28S and 18S rRNA we labeled knockdown and control U343MGa Cl2:6 cells with \[^3^H\]-uridine for 2 hours and examined the labeled and isolated rRNA following gel electrophoresis and blotting to a nylon membrane. We found that in RPS9 knockdown cultures very little mature 18S rRNA was produced during the labeling period ([Figure 4C](#pone-0009578-g004){ref-type="fig"}), however overall cellular RNA synthesis continued ([Figure 4D](#pone-0009578-g004){ref-type="fig"}). Actinomycin D (5 nM) efficiently blocked synthesis and labeling of rRNA ([Figure 4C and D](#pone-0009578-g004){ref-type="fig"}). In an experiment using \[^3^H\]-L-methyl methionine to label newly synthesized rRNA we found that the production of 18S rRNA was clearly impaired ([Figure 4E](#pone-0009578-g004){ref-type="fig"}). There was a marginal decrease in the new synthesis of 28S rRNA. Moreover, the depletion of RPS9 in U343MGa Cl2:6 cells decreased

Breast cancer is a spectrum of diseases comprised of different tumor subtypes, each with a distinct biology and clinical behavior. To capture this diversify, we characterized the variation in gene expression across human breast tumors using DNA microarrays and identified at least five distinct tumor subtypes that are statistically significant predictors of patient overall survival \[[@B1]\]. Recently, we further validated these findings using a training set of 102 tumors, which was used to derive a new \'intrinsic gene set\'. This gene set was then validated using a true test set of 311 tumors compiled from three different microarray studies. Our analyses demonstrate that common patterns of gene expression can be identified across different microarray platforms, that the breast tumor \'intrinsic\' subtypes are reproducible across different datasets, and that this classification was a significant predictor of outcomes after correcting for standard clinical parameters such as estrogen receptor (ER), grade and node status \[[@B2]\].

The biology of the \'intrinsic\' subtypes is rich and extensive, and many of these expression features suggest distinct therapies. The \'intrinsic\' subtypes include at least two types of ER-negative tumors (Basal-like and HER2^+^/ER^-^) and at least two types of ER-positive tumors (Luminal A and Luminal B). Basal-like tumors typically show low expression of HER2 and ER, and these tumors exhibit high expression of genes characteristic of the basal epithelial cell layer, including expression of keratin 5, keratin 6, keratin 17 and four Kallikrein genes (*KLK5*-*KLK8*). The Basal-like tumors pose a challenge from the treatment perspective because they lack ER and HER2. However, we have recently shown that most are HER1-positive and/or c-KIT-positive \[[@B3]\], and we have initiated a clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of HER1-inhibitors in preselected Basal-like tumor patients.

HER2-positive (i.e. gene amplified) tumors fall into at least two distinct expression groups: those that are ER-negative and typically cluster near the Basal-like tumors (HER2^+^/ER^-^), and those that are ER-positive and cluster with tumors of luminal cell origin. These findings suggest that both types of HER2^+^patients should receive transtuzumab, but that the ER^+^/HER2^+^may gain a benefit from hormone therapy.

Finally, the Luminal subtype A and Luminal subtype B tumors express ER, GATA3, and genes regulated by both ER

Quantification of histological assays {#sec016}
-------------------------------------

For the quantification of the proliferation rate, apoptotic rate, cellular density, vessel density and dilation, ImagePro software was used (MediaCybernetics, Bethesda, MD) and analyses were performed as in reference \[[@pone.0121003.ref013]\]. For each analysis, tumors/lungs obtained from at least 2 to 3 different mice per group were used, and at least 6--7 photographs were taken per tumor/lung.

Statistics {#sec017}
----------

RNA sequencing and clinical data: Fisher's exact tests were performed to examine the association between Tks5α expression levels and patients with different disease stages, tumor type, grade, etc. Overall survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test for all BRCA patients and those patients with more than 5 years survival. Multivariate analysis by the Cox proportional hazard model (adjusted by age, tumor subtype, and pathological stage) was performed to assess survival results. P-values (two-tailed) of \<0.05 were considered statistically significant.

In vitro experiments: All numerical data are shown as mean ± SD. Error bars on all graphs represent the standard deviation between measurements.

*In vivo* experiments: Statistical significance was determined by student's t test, or two-way repeated ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc test, as appropriate.

Tks5 expression in breast cancer specimens {#sec019}
------------------------------------------

To explore the clinical relevance of Tks5 expression in breast cancer, we first conducted immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis on a cohort of human breast cancer tissues provided by the Cancer Diagnosis Program of the National Cancer Institute. We used a commercial rabbit polyclonal antibody which we first validated for specificity for Tks5 using transfected cell populations ([Fig 1A](#pone.0121003.g001){ref-type="fig"}). The same batch of antibody, and the same staining protocol, was used on the breast cancer tissue microarrays (TMA), and a scoring system was developed. These TMAs also contained a few (\<20) specimens of normal breast tissue and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Normal breast tissue was largely negative or 1+ for Tks5 expression, although we did detect occasional terminal lobules, and isolated ductal cells, which were strongly positive ([Fig 1B](#pone.0121003.g001){ref-type="fig"}).

Discussion {#Sec6}
==========

The main findings of this study are that H1 is present in human tears and levels of H1 are significantly reduced in patients with ADDE. This study represents the first robust demonstration of H1 in human tears, building upon initial findings amongst multiple groups^[@CR14],[@CR15],[@CR17],[@CR22]^.

Multiple qualitative and quantitative methods were used to confirm the presence of H1 in OSW. H1 was demonstrably present in human OSW using Immune Dot Blot (IDB), western immunoblotting, ELISA and MRM. Moreover, H1 expression level was found to vary significantly between normal and ADDE patients. This demonstration of the presence of histatin in tears, and deficiency of H1 in ADDE, suggests that evaluation of H1 in the pathogenesis of disease and utility in diagnosis and therapy of ADDE merit further investigation. The potential importance of histatins in ocular surface biology is highlighted by their demonstrated importance as contributors to oral epithelial and salivary homeostasis. Additionally, the importance of histatins levels as potential diagnostics is shown by findings lower than normal salivary histatin levels in rheumatoid arthritis patients with oral sicca symptoms^[@CR11],[@CR13]^.

Interestingly, previous non-targeted proteomics studies using traditional LC-MS methods have not demonstrated the presence of H1 in human tears^[@CR25]^. It is possible H1 was not previously detected by LC-MS because of the limitations of traditionally used methodology and the superiority of MRM in directed testing for specific proteins in human bodily fluids^[@CR26],[@CR27]^. Clinical phenotype of DED also seems to have a considerable effect on tear protein composition, with aqueous deficiency associated with greater alterations of protein expression patterns. Additionally, it should be noted that not many proteins appear to be selectively downregulated in dry eye disease, highlighting the importance of these altered proteins as potential markers or treatments of disease^[@CR28]^. Moreover, variations in total protein level in tears did not correlate with levels of H1, suggesting that H1 concentrations vary independently of protein concentration in tears in general.

We found that H1 levels are lower in ADDE patients than normal patients. We also found that there was a negative association with age and H1 levels. After controlling for age, using statistical modeling, the association between H1 and ADDE diagnosis was still present, suggesting that age differences do not account for the association of low H1 levels and ADDE diagnosis. There was also a strong correlation of H1 concentration with

### Correlation of the expression of genes in the ErbB signaling pathway with clinical event data {#Sec7}

Association of the expression of genes in the ErbB pathway (Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes: KEGG pathway id 04012) with clinical data was analyzed using the globaltest method (Goeman et al. [@CR10]). The globaltest method is used to test the null hypothesis of no association of genes in the pathway with the selected clinical event. We tested association with the following clinical data observed in 24 patients:Need for inotropic therapy: yes vs. noPulmonary edema: yes vs. noStandard troponin I level: elevated vs. value in normal rangeEjection fraction of left ventricle (EF): supra- vs. inframedianDuration of hospitalization (days): supra- vs. inframedian30 days follow-up: improvement vs. no improvement to NYHA class I/II

The analyses were performed with the globaltest R/Bioconductor package. The significant genes were selected based on the globaltest *p*-value \< 0.05.

At the time of admission to the intensive care unit, before beginning any treatment, nine patients were recognized with pulmonary edema diagnosis and seven patients needed inotropic therapy. Moreover, 11 patients had elevated levels of troponin. The baseline hemodynamic parameters were recorded: (1) blood pressure: median = 140/70 mmHg \[range: 60/40--200/120\]; (2) heart rate: median = 115/min \[range 95--160 \]; (3) NTproBNP: median = 6,550 pg/ml \[range: 1,100--17,700\].

Biplane volume determination by two-dimensional echocardiography was used to evaluate the left ventricular ejection fraction and EF = 40 % was the median value \[range: 15--56 %\]. A period of 12 days resulted as the median value of hospitalization time, with a range between 5--58 days. It means that 12 patients needed hospitalization longer than 12 days. During 30 days of observation, 12 patients have experienced improvement to NYHA class I/II.

Analysis of the association of the expression of genes in the ErbB pathway with selected clinical data of patients revealed a significant association of some ErbB genes with the troponin level, ejection fraction, and need for inotropic therapy (Table [

The microfluidic device was designed using computer-aided design (CAD) software, to provide a continuous concentration gradient for the chemical stimulation of a cell culture ([@b9-etm-09-01-0154]). The device included two parts ([Fig. 1A](#f1-etm-09-01-0154){ref-type="fig"}), namely a pyramid shaped concentration gradient generator (CGG) and a cell culture chamber. In accordance with the Reynolds effect, the Reynolds number can be very low when the capillary diameter is \~100 nm to several hundred micrometers, and liquid will show a laminar flow when it passes through the serpentine channels of the microfluidic chip. When using this chip, if one solution (concentration A) and a second solution (concentration 0) are injected into the CGG via the two inlets, they are split at the nodes, combined with neighboring streams in a laminar fashion, and mixed by diffusion in the serpentine channels, and the concentrations in the eight outlets are, respectively, 0, 1/7A, 2/7A, 3/7A, 4/7A, 5/7A, 6/7A and A.

Three cell culture chambers of the same function were connected between two parallel channels of each outlet of the CGG. The volume of each chamber was 0.4 μl (length, 800 μm; width, 500 μm; height, 100 μm). The SCs were loaded into a chamber through an input hole. When solutions flow down the parallel channels, substances contained in them, such as FK506, diffuse into the chamber by osmosis until saturation is achieved.

The microfluidic devices were fabricated in poly-dimethylsiloxane (PDMS) using rapid prototyping and soft lithography ([@b11-etm-09-01-0154]). Firstly, a transparency mask was generated by a high resolution printer from the CAD file. The mask was used in 1:1 contact photolithography with an SU-8 photoresist (MicroChem, Newton, MA, USA) to generate a negative master consisting of a patterned photoresist on a silicon wafer. Positive replicas with embossed channels were fabricated by molding PDMS against the master. Secondly, the inlets and outlets (ϕ=1 mm) for the fluids were punched out of the PDMS using a sharpened needle. Then, an ultrasonically cleaned glass substrate and the PDMS molding were irreversibly combined together to form a system

Introduction {#Sec1}
============

Health effects of ionising radiation are divided into two categories: deterministic effects (also referred to as tissue effects) and stochastic effects (ICRP 103 [@CR23]). The former, such as skin necrosis, are unavoidable but only after a certain threshold of dose was exceeded. Thus, staying below the dose threshold provides full protection. The latter, such as cancer, do not have a threshold and occur with a certain probability which is proportional to the dose. Thus, reducing the absorbed dose does not provide full protection, but only minimises the probability of the adverse effect manifesting. Moreover, large uncertainties prevail over the shape of the dose--response curve in the low-dose region, with opinions spanning between the existence of a threshold below which there is no excess risk, to the belief that, per unit dose, low doses are more detrimental than high doses (UNSCEAR [@CR53]).

Deterministic radiation effects which can be simply avoided by keeping the radiation exposures below their threshold dose cause little public concern. With sufficient knowledge of dose--response relationships and efficient regulations, such effects can be prevented. The situation is quite different for stochastic effects which cannot be fully prevented unless the exposure is completely eliminated. Hence, the question inescapably arises as to which exposure level is acceptable. An essential element of the radiation protection system is justification, which implies that a radiation exposure is acceptable when the benefit of exposure exceeds the risk of the detriment (ICRP 103 [@CR23]). This approach is reasonable under the assumption that the dose--response relationship for the risk factor is well documented. This is not the case for cancer induced by low doses of ionising radiation (Brenner et al. [@CR11]).

A consequence of the uncertainty in the quantification of risk of low doses, but also of the stochastic nature of risk, is that radiation exposure is often met with deep concern and even fear (Slovic [@CR48]). Psychological effects following the two major accidents in nuclear power plants at the Three Mile Island and Fukushima Daiichi, where the public was never exposed to high-radiation doses, as well as Chernobyl, where the majority of exposed people received low doses, dramatically illustrate the situation (Bromet [@CR12]). Another example is food preservation by ionising radiation which does not reduce the quality of food but nevertheless is prohibited in many countries because of (to all appearances unfounded) concern for adverse health effects (Heddle et al. [@CR22]).

2. Study patients
-----------------

During the study period, 212 sputum samples from newly diagnosed pulmonary TB patients were subjected to culture. The mean age of the patients was 39±16.4 yr, and 128 (60.4%) were males. After excluding 21 contaminated or unculturable samples, 191 *M. tuberculosis* isolates comprising 142 (74.3%) from the Yangon region and 49 (25.7%) from the Mandalay region were subjected to phenotypic and genotypic DST.

3. Isolation of *M. tuberculosis* and phenotypic DST
----------------------------------------------------

Isolation of *M. tuberculosis* from sputum samples and DST with conventional culture was performed at the National TB Reference Laboratory (NTRL; Yangon, Myanmar) and Upper Myanmar TB Laboratory (Mandalay, Myanmar). *M. tuberculosis* was isolated from sputum samples according to the WHO method \[[@B5]\]. Sputum samples were decontaminated with N-acetyl-L-cysteine sodium hydroxide. After centrifugation at a speed of 3,000-3,500g for 15 min, the pellet was suspended in 1 mL 1×phosphate-buffered saline, inoculated on two Lowenstein-Jensen (L-J) media slants, and incubated at 37℃ for 6-8 weeks depending on the time required for the organisms to become evident. Mycobacterial growth was monitored every week. The *M. tuberculosis* isolates were identified according to growth rate and colony morphology. The Capilia TB test (Tauns, Numazu, Japan), an immunochromatographic assay that uses a monoclonal antibody to detect MPB64 antigen, was used to differentiate *M. tuberculosis* complex from non-tuberculous mycobacteria.

Phenotypic DST was carried out on confirmed *M. tuberculosis* isolates. The test was performed on L-J media containing INH (0.2 µg/mL), RIF (40 µg/mL), SM (4 µg/mL), and EMB (2 µg/mL) according to the WHO-recommended proportional method for all primary isolates \[[@B6]\]. Inocula were cultured in a 37℃ incubator for 6 weeks, and the results were interpreted as susceptible or resistant. The standard criterion of the proportion method for classifying a strain as resistant was the ratio of the number of colonies obtained on drug-containing medium to the number of colonies obtained on drug-free medium (growth of ≥ 1% of

Tumor reactivity of WT and PD-1^KO^ T cell clones on PD-L1 expressing cell lines {#s3-5}

We compared the reactivity of PD-1-edited and WT T cell clones on the Tap-deficient T2 cell line (stably expressing or not PD-L1) loaded with the Melan-A~A27L~ antigenic peptide, or on a HLA-A2 melanoma cell line expressing or not PD-L1. As the T2 cell line and cultured human melanoma cell lines do not express spontaneously PD-L1, we previously established these PD-L1 expressing cell lines through stable transfection of a PD-L1 expression plasmid.[@R36] The reactivity of T cell clones was tested on the PD-L1-positive cell lines and their non-transfected counterparts by IFN-γ and IL-2 specific ELISA tests after a 12 hours activation period ([figure 5A, B](#F5){ref-type="fig"}). Logically, IFN-γ production was decreased on activation of WT4 T cell clone by PD-L1 expressing T2 cell line loaded with the Melan-A~A27L~ peptide ([figure 5A](#F5){ref-type="fig"}, left panel, dotted line), compared with the PD-L1 negative T2 cell line (solid line). In contrast, the reactivity of the PD-1^KO^ T cell clone was not affected by PD-L1 expression on peptide-loaded T2 cells ([figure 5A](#F5){ref-type="fig"}, right panel). As expected, we obtained similar results with the wild-type and the PD-L1 expressing melanoma cell lines ([figure 5B](#F5){ref-type="fig"}), namely that IFN-γ and IL-2 production were decreased on activation of WT4 T cell clone by PD-L1 expressing melanoma cells (left panel, dotted lines), compared with non-expressing ones (solid lines), whereas the expression of PD-L1 by melanoma cells did not alter IFN-γ and IL-2 production by KO6 T cell clone ([figure 5B](#F5){ref-type="fig"}, right panel). Of note, we also observed that although not affected by PD-1/PD-L1 signaling, the KO6 T cell clone globally produced lower levels of IFN-γ and IL-2 than the WT4 T cell clone especially in response to melanoma cell lines,

Our Western blot analysis showed that transgenic protein was expressed in the cortex and cerebellum from the earliest time point assayed, six weeks post-gestation, through 12 months of age. As has been previously reported, in non-transgenic animals we detected nuclear β-catenin only in the thalamus and other deep grey matter structures \[[@B31]\]. In transgenic lines expressing mutant, stabilized protein, immunohistochemical analysis revealed nuclear β-catenin in both internal granule layer (IGL) and molecular layer neurons of the cerebellum. Cortical neurons and hippocampal granule and pyramidal cells also contained nuclear β-catenin in transgenic but not non-transgenic animals. We also examined the subcellular localization of mutant β-catenin in newborn transgenic mice. In these P0 animals we failed to identify nuclear β-catenin in the proliferative cells of the cerebellar external granule cell layer or in periventricular neuroblasts. Thus in our transgenic animals, aberrant Wnt activation appears to be limited to mature, postmitotic neurons.

Wnt activation in the adult hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum did not result in tumors or other CNS malformations. Strain effects are unlikely to have played a role in this lack of a neoplastic phenotype, as mice with the same background as the one we used have previously been shown to develop medulloblastomas \[[@B12]\]. We further attempted to induce CNS tumors by abrogating p53 function in conjunction with transgenic β-catenin expression. The rational for this approach was the markedly increased incidence of medulloblastomas seen in PTCH heterozygotes deficient for p53, and the enhanced intestinal adenoma phenotype of *p53*null, APC heterozygous *Min*mice \[[@B12],[@B32]\]. We did not observe any significant phenotypic changes in the CNS of β-catenin transgenic animals heterozygous or homozygous for disruption of the *p53*locus. However, most of the β-catenin transgenic mice heterozygous for *p53*were followed for only 9 months, and it is possible that some of these mice could develop tumors at a later age.

In transgenic mice expressing mutant β-catenin in the breast or colon, protein levels similar to those we describe are sufficient to promote abnormal differentiation and tumors. Harada and colleagues documented intestinal polyposis in β-catenin transgenic mice with a less than 2-fold increase in β-catenin protein level in the polyps \[[@B33]\]. The authors point out that because the transgene was only expressed in a fraction of cells in this tissue, protein levels are likely higher in some epithelial cells

### NCCM-derived EVs and proteins induce GAG deposition in canine and human CLC micro-aggregates {#s2_2_1}

Based on the expected EV sizes and protein measurements, the three NCCM SEC fractions with most EVs and proteins (P) were separately collected ([Supplementary Figure 3](#SD1){ref-type="supplementary-material"}). Part was directly used in culture (EV~qEV~ and P~qEV~), and part was subjected to 100,000*g* UC and thereafter used in culture (EV~UC~ and P~UC~). After 7 days of culture, no treatment significantly influenced the canine micro-aggregates' DNA content compared with controls (Figure [3a](#F3){ref-type="fig"}). The GAG and GAG/DNA content of the canine micro-aggregates were, however, significantly increased by 7-day unfractionated NCCM, EV~qEV~, EV~UC~, P~qEV~, and P~UC~ treatment (*p*\<0.05), with no differences between these treatments (Figure [3b](#F3){ref-type="fig"} and [3c](#F3){ref-type="fig"}).

Advances in mathematical modeling have led to various effective tools for early diagnosis, such as the application of thermometry ultrasonic techniques. Before implementation of the ultrasonic noninvasive estimation of thermal gradients into tissues based on spectral changes, rigorous analyses, over transient echotraces acquired from well-controlled biological and computational phantoms, must be still made in order to improve resolutions and evaluate clinic limitations. I. Bazan et al. applied this technique to computationally modeled echotraces from scattered biological phantoms, attaining high resolution (better than 0.1°C). They also provided computer methods for viability evaluation of thermal estimation from echoes with distinct noise levels, making it difficult to interpret the readings. As a result of their analyses, the technique has been evaluated as a possible effective diagnosis tool for scattered tissues applications. Such research and analyses are of great importance since the ability to detect changes of thermal origin in ultrasonic echo spectra means the achievement of precise noninvasive temperature estimations that could be very useful as an early complementary indicator of infections, inflammations, or cancer.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an important health issue and has been subject to different modeling investigations. C. T. Su et al. have applied a Mutliclass Mahalanobis-Taguchi System (MMTS) to the problem of prediagnosing the condition using readily available patient information. Their model results in a better than 84% accuracy. This statistical diagnostic/predictive method comes from pattern information technology and demonstrates an important application of a little used modeling paradigm in biology.

The paper by C. Pagel et al. addresses a problem of growing relevance with an aging population, dwindling resources, and a declining number of healthcare providers: that of optimal scheduling in the context of a stepped care. This topic is of considerable interest, not only in the domain addressed by the authors, but in other populations requiring complex, highly specialized care. The author\'s model includes stratified levels of intensity of care, and can be used to analyze expected changes in waiting times and throughput under different allocations of scheduled slots. This quantitative model will be of highly operational interest---particularly to large, integrated healthcare systems confronted with a growing mental healthcare population. Moreover, since the model is sufficiently flexible, it may be adapted to address queuing systems germane to other highly complex medical conditions.

Healthcare providers and networks face more than resource limitations: increased oversight and an emphasis on the quality of care are wending their way

The present analysis also investigated whether there were differences in outcomes for the different types of instrument playing tasks. For overall effects on each of seven cognitive domains, low effect sizes were obtained for general cognition (*d* = 0.28), memory (*d* = 0.26), verbal fluency (*d* = 0.19), attentional control (*d* = 0.22), executive function (*d* = 0.25), and visuospatial perception (*d* = 0.19). A large effect size was observed for processing speed (*d* = 0.94). Substantial heterogeneity was found with processing speed, memory, and executive function (61--84%), while low heterogeneity was found with general cognition, verbal fluency, attentional control, and visuospatial perception.

In order to see which type of cognitive domain might be addressed more effectively with which type of cognitive involvement, subgroup analysis was conducted with the moderating variable of the type of cognitive involvement \[i.e., immediate engagement with the addition

Regarding the translational use of IDO inhibitors, different clinical trials are ongoing. Recently, a failure on a phase 3 trial in metastatic melanoma, based on the combination of epacadostat (IDO1 inhibitor) with pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 antibody), generated a disappointment in the so-called "second generation" of immuno-oncology drugs (clinical trial information: NCT02752074) ([@B25]). However, in another trial based on epacadostat plus a multipeptide melanoma vaccine, besides normalized serum kynurenine/tryptophan ratios in most patients, data indicated an enhancement of CD8^+^ T cell infiltration in tumor milieu in patients with melanoma submitted to the combination therapy (clinical trial information: NCT01961115) ([@B26]). Interestingly, a phase 2 trial with another class of IDO inhibitor, the indoximod (D-1MT), plus gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel showed promising results regarding the use of IDO inhibitors for patients with metastatic pancreas cancer (clinical trial information: NCT02077881) ([@B27]). In this trial, data indicate increased intra-tumoral CD8^+^ T cell density in biopsies of responder patients submitted to the combination therapy. Overall, these data highlight the importance of the association of antitumor vaccines, and/or immuno-chemotherapy with IDO inhibitors.

We recently showed that the gDE7-based vaccine induces multifunctional E7-specific CD8^+^ T cells with cytotoxic activity as well as expansion of effector memory T cells and activation of mouse and human specialized DC subset capable to promote antigen cross-presentation ([@B29]). In the present study, we observed that treatment with one metabolic adjuvant provided enhanced gDE7-mediated antitumor protection but only the combination of melatonin and one IDO inhibitor conferred complete tumor protection. Regarding IDO1 inhibitors, we observed a superior preclinical antitumor activity relative to DL-1MT in side-by-side comparisons to D-1MT, which is the isoform actually under clinical trials ([@B23]). Previous evidences indicated that D-1MT was more effective than DL-1MT as an anti-cancer agent and reversed the T cell suppression effect mediated by IDO1-expressing DCs ([@B33]). Similarly, recruitment and activation of tumor-infiltrating MDSCs and regulatory T cells, driven by expression of IDO1, could be successfully reversed by D-1MT in mice ([@B19]). On the other hand, the

PCR products were hybridized to an antisense RNA probe encompassing nucleotides +1 to +250.](1742-4690-10-55-2){#F2}

These constructs were used to analyse the SDm1 and SDm2 LTR variants by ribonuclease protection assays (RPAs) (Figure [2](#F2){ref-type="fig"}B). For the RPA, three antisense RNA probes complementary to nucleotides +1 to +250 -- encoding the wild-type, the SDm1, or the SDm2 MSD -- were produced. A specific probe for each construct was necessary to avoid cleavage of the RNA probe at the mutated MSD due to non-pairing. All transfections included a Tas expression plasmid (pCMVTas) as expression of the viral transactivator Tas is required to activate the LTR promoter. Transcripts cleaved/polyadenylated at the LTR poly(A) site should result in a protected 193-nucleotide fragment (Figure [2](#F2){ref-type="fig"}A), whereas suppression of this site should result in a 250-nucleotide fragment. The RPAs showed that suppression of the poly(A) site at the 5′LTR is incomplete and that suppression of polyadenylation acts at the first step of polyadenylation, i.e

5.  The disorder is not only observed during episodes of anorexia nervosa.

6.  Episodes of binge eating and compensatory behaviors are observed at least once a week over a period of 3 months \[[@cit0016]\].

Etiology of bulimia nervosa {#sec3}
===========================

The etiology of bulimia nervosa is complex and not completely clear. A combination of factors has to be present for this disease to develop. The reasons include the following: biological (genetic predisposition, impaired mechanism of satiety control, neurochemical disorders including serotonin deficiency), behavioral (abnormal eating habits and irregular eating, using nutritional restrictions), psychological (depression, impaired emotion regulation, low self-esteem with high expectations of oneself), systemic/family (impaired relations and communication between family members) and sociocultural (the cult of the body and aspiration to have a perfect body) conditions \[[@cit0019]--[@cit0021]\].

Clinical picture of bulimia nervosa {#sec4}
===================================

A consistent clinical picture of bulimia nervosa is observed only in a small group of patients. The phenomenon of diagnostic migration, occurring in the majority of patients, means the movement between diagnoses associated with eating disorders. Migration reflects a pattern in which eating disorders start with dietetic limitations, followed by failure of the self-control mechanism and leading to binge eating \[[@cit0022]\]. An episode of binge eating may be a single 2-hour episode that ends with compensatory behaviors, but it may also include a series of episodes interrupted with instances of behaviors aimed at eliminating food from the body that are typical of a given subject. Episodes of overeating and engaging in compensatory mechanisms constitute a method to indicate an approach to oneself and others, and a strategy of coping with affect, both positive and negative \[[@cit0023]\]. In subjects with an impaired process of emotion regulation, eating disorders may be pathologic and associated with an inappropriate amount, quality and frequency of food consumption \[[@cit0024]\].

Psychopathology of bulimia nervosa {#sec5}
==================================

Eating disorders have a common, specific psychopathological background that is cognitive and involves paying too much attention to body weight and possibilities of its control \[[@cit0022]\]. Patients suffering from bulimia nervosa base their self-esteem on their external appearance and not on their achievements and activities in various spheres of life. Additionally, they are characterized by dysfunctions in emotion interpretation and regulation (the lack of ability

On physical examination, the patient was determined to be morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 51.8 kg/m^2^. Her blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg. There were no carotid bruits or jugular venous distension. Cardiac auscultation showed distant heart sounds with no audible murmurs or gallops. Lower extremity examination showed +1 edema with weak pedal pulses.

Her current medications included nisoldipine 20 mg daily, losartan/hydrochlorothiazide 100/25 mg per day, atenolol 25 mg per day, and lansoprazole 30 mg per day.

The patient's ECG showed non-specific ST segment and T-wave changes. Initial echocardiogram demonstrated left ventricular hypertrophy, left atrial enlargement, and diastolic dysfunction grade I with preserved ejection fraction. An adenosine nuclear study showed an area of reversible ischemia of the inferior wall. Subsequently, she underwent right and left cardiac catheterization.

Selective left coronary angiography demonstrated short left main coronary artery (LCA) that originated appropriately from the left sinus of Valsalva. From the LCA, left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCX) coronary arteries arose in a typical course ([Figures 1A](#f1-amjcaserep-19-992){ref-type="fig"}, [2A](#f2-amjcaserep-19-992){ref-type="fig"}). Both LAD and LCX were dilated and tortuous without significant stenosis. The right coronary artery (RCA) was visualized in a retrograde fashion almost instantaneously via collaterals originating from the left coronary system ([Figure 1B](#f1-amjcaserep-19-992){ref-type="fig"}, [Video 1](#f4-amjcaserep-19-992){ref-type="fig"}**)**. The RCA was markedly tortuous and dilated with no significant stenosis. It drained into the main pulmonary artery ([Figure 2B](#f2-amjcaserep-19-992){ref-type="fig"}, [Video 2](#f5-amjcaserep-19-992){ref-type="fig"}). On aortic root angiography, the origin of the RCA could not be determined ([Figure 3](#f3-amjcaserep-19-992){ref-type="fig"}, [Video 3](#f6-amjcaserep-19-992){ref

Histomorphometry and Immunofluorescence {#Sec8}
---------------------------------------

Undecalcified samples were prepared for subsequent histomorphometry studies. Samples were cleaned of soft tissue, dehydrated in graded alcohols and embedded in methyl methacrylate. Then, sections of 200 μm in thickness were cut longitudinally, ground to 20 μm and stained with Van Gieson (VG) and Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) for microscopic examination. Images were observed and captured with a light microscope (DMI6000, Leica Inc., Germany).

For sclerostin immunofluorescence, sections were washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and blocked in goat serum for 10 min at room temperature. Endogenous peroxidases were quenched with 3% H~2~O~2~, and sections were incubated in rabbit sclerostin polyclonal antibody (Bioss Inc., China) for 24 h at 4 °C. After washing in PBS, sections were incubated with secondary antibody labeled with FITC. Images were captured with a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) (Fluo View FV-1000, Olympus Inc., Japan). Fluorescence intensity was measured in five areas of each section using the CLSM software, and the average was calculated for statistical analyses.

RNA Extraction and RT-qPCR {#Sec9}
--------------------------

Bone tissue at the base of the implant was snap frozen and crushed in liquid N~2~. According to the manufacturer's instructions, total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent and was dissolved in DEPC H~2~O. cDNA was synthesized using a 10 μl reverse transcription reaction mixture composed of 0.5 μg total RNA, 2 μl 5× PrimeScriptTM Buffer, 0.5 μl PrimeScriptTM RT Enzyme Mix I and 0.5 μl random primer. Partial sequences of SOST, β-catenin, RANKL and β-actin in the reverse transcribed cDNA were amplified using a fluorescence RT-qPCR instrument (RG-3000, Gene Inc., Australia). The forward and reverse primer sequences used for amplification are listed in Supplementary Table [S2](#MOESM1){ref-type="media"}. Relative mRNA expression levels were standardized to β-actin expression for quantified analyses using the ∆Ct method.

To understand the phylogenetic relationship with *Arabidopsis* PTKs and to identify the subfamily of kinases, rice PTK sequences were used as query and 18 *Arabidopsis* homologs were identified. The analysis of homologs in the phylogenetic tree revealed that most of the *Arabidopsis* homologs of rice PTKs belonged to group VII of receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs), which are mainly AVRPPHB SUSCEPTIBLE 1 (PBS1)-like 1 (PBL) proteins ([Figure 4](#plants-09-00664-f004){ref-type="fig"}). The orthologs of *OsPTK1*, *OsPTK4* and *OsPTK15* in *Arabidopsis* encode PBL proteins. The PBL proteins are involved in plant innate immunity \[[@B27-plants-09-00664],[@B28-plants-09-00664],[@B29-plants-09-00664],[@B30-plants-09-00664]\]. Besides their role in innate immunity, *OsPTK1* orthologs of Arabidopsis *PBL34* (AT3G01300) and *PBL35* (AT3G01300) have also been shown to regulate vitamin E biosynthesis in seeds \[[@B31-plants-09-00664]\]. Orthologs of *OsPTK6* and *OsPTK12* in Arabidopsis *COLD-RESPONSIVE PROTEIN KINASE 1* (*CRPK1*, AT1G16670) \[[@B32-plants-09-00664]\] and *Calcium/Calmodulin-Regulated Receptor-Like Kinase 1* (*CRLK1*, AT5G54590) \[[@B33-plants-09-00664]\], respectively, have been shown to regulate cold tolerance. RLKs contain a ligand binding ectodomain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic kinase domain \[[@B34-plants-09-00664]\]. RLCKs are a subfamily of RLKs which lack transmembrane domains and ligand binding domain but retain the intracellular domains with kinase activity. There are about 162, 160, and 402 *RLCK* genes in maize, rice, and *Arabidopsis*, respectively \[[@B35-plants-09-00664],[@B36-plants-09-00664],[@B37-plants-09-00664]\]. Based on phylogenetic analysis these RLCKs have been divided into 15--17 subgroups in *Arabidopsis*, rice and maize \[[@B

In this analysis, post-operative complications remain a major prognostic factor for 5-year OS, since they reduce drastically patients\' chance for OS, from 25.6% with complications to 43.6% without. The negative impact of perioperative morbidity has been demonstrated in several other malignancies, including CLM [@pone.0114404-Matsuda1]. While this association has been clearly established, it is unclear

For the Rotameter test the animals were i.p. injected with 5 mg/kg amphetamine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) and placed into a transparent cylindrical container (Rotameter, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA). After 10 minutes of habituation, animal behavior was recorded with a high resolution webcam for 20 minutes. The resulting movies were analyzed for the amount of rotations per mouse. After the movies were taken, the mice were fixed into an adjustable harness connected by a flexible wire to a digital rotation sensor (LE 902/Sr, Harvard Apparatus), which counted the rotation of the mice at four points of a complete circle. After five minutes of habituation, measurement was started. Video (data not shown) and harness analysis showed the same tendencies between control and Minocycline treated animals.

Statistical analysis
--------------------

Statistical analysis was done using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) and SigmaPlot (Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). Statistical tests were used as indicated in the figure legends. The number of animals used in each experiment was as indicated in the figure legends. All statistics from cell culture experiments are based on 700 to 1,450 counted cells. For the migration experiments, between 3,000 to 16,850 nuclei were counted per treatment group. For the EdU and Dcx quantifications in the pRMS and the SVZ between 14,400 to 41,600 nuclei were counted per treatment group.

Ethical considerations
----------------------

All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the German Federal law on the Care and Use of laboratory animals. The corresponding licenses were granted by the Landesamt fuer Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz Nordrhein-Westfalen (Germany).

Results

Among the factors characterizing neuroinflammation is the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α, which is released by activated microglia cells \[[@B22]\]. *In vitro*neural stem cells only express the TNF-α Receptor I (TNFRI), but not the TNFRII (Additional file [1](#S1){ref-type="supplementary-material"}, Figure S1). Additionally, components of the downstream nuclear factor \'kappa-light-chain-enhancer\' of activated B-cells (NF-κB)- and mitogen-activated-protein-kinase (MAPK)-pathways are expressed.

Because the chronicity of neuroinfl

Mycobacterial mmpL proteins have been well documented to be involved in the biosynthesis and export of cell wall lipid constituents, and play a role in mycobacterium pathogenesis^[@CR38]^. In addition, recent studies on VDAC have generated strong evidence on its association/interaction with host lipids^[@CR39],\ [@CR40]^. The ability of VDAC to influence the cholesterol distribution of mitochondrial membrane has been also recently demonstrated^[@CR41]^, and cholesterol and ergosterol have been found to form complex with purified VDAC protein^[@CR42]^. It also has been established that the oligomerization of VDAC can be significantly influenced by lipids^[@CR40]^. In attempts to investigate the possible relation between VDAC, mmpL4 proteins and *M. avium* surface-associated lipid export into macrophages, we pretreated THP-1 cells with DIDS for 4 hours and then infected cells with Texas red hydrazide-labeled *M. avium*. The DIDS was kept up to 24 h in the culture medium and lipid release from bacterial surface was analyzed by fluorescent microscopy. THP-1 cells without DIDS treatment served as a control. As previously identified by Beatty *et al*.^[@CR15]^, the extensive release of the Texas red label from mycobacterial surface was observed at 24 h post-infection of THP-1 (Fig. [5A](#Fig5){ref-type="fig"}). In contrast, macrophages treated with DIDS had the red fluorescent label markedly contained within *M. avium* phagosomes, suggesting the involvement of VDAC in bacterial cell wall component translocation. Evaluation of two hundred *M. avium*-infected THP-1 cells without DIDS treatment confirmed the observation that majority (87%) of the host macrophages permeated the red fluorescence that was released from the Texas Red-labeled bacteria. Conversely, only 19% of the DIDS treated macrophages had a positive staining (Fig. [5B](#Fig5){ref-type="fig"}). Results were further confirmed using the flow cytometry (Fig. [5C](#Fig5){ref-type="fig"}). To insure that the fluorescent labeling of host cells was not the result of *M. avium* presence in the cytosol, the percentage of Rab5 positive phagosomes were calculated in THP-1 cells with and without DIDS treatment and the co-localization rate of Rab5 in both groups were observed to be similar (Fig. [5D](#Fig5){

Finally, we calculated the G parameter, defined as the sum of the squares of the differences of each signature between plasma and HMW-enriched (G=0.06475 and G=0.069799, respectively) as well as between plasma and LMW-enriched (G=0.04969 and G=0.052517, respectively). In both CRC-UD24 and CRC-UD21 the genetic similarity between the LMW-enriched urine and the matched plasma was higher than that identified in HMW-enriched DNA fragments ([figure 4](#F4){ref-type="fig"}B,D).

In the cases CRC-UD24 and CRC-UD21, in which we were able to analyse the low and high-enriched molecular weight fragments, separately, we sought to differentiate the molecular variations identified in the HMW-enriched and LMW-enriched DNA fragments in urine sample ([figure 5](#F5){ref-type="fig"}A,D) as well as in the matched tumour tissue and plasma. A concordance of 40/89 mutations (45%) and 25/89 mutations (28%) was obtained in LMW-enriched and HMW-enriched DNA fragments, respectively ([figure 5](#F5){ref-type="fig"}B

Experimental
------------

### *Chemicals*

Standards of several phenylpropanoid acids (*t*-cinnamate, dihydrocinnamate, *p*-coumarate, *p*-dihydrocoumarate, caffeate, dihydrocaffeate, ferulate, dihydroferulate), chalcones and dihydrochalcones, as well as acetonitrile, ammonium acetate, formic acid, and HPLC grade water, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The other chalcones used in this investigation were synthesized and purified based on a previously published protocol \[[@B17]\]. All chemicals were dissolved in acetonitrile-water with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid, at a final concentration of 100 μM.

MMS-induced damage and BER intermediates can lead to collapsed replication forks that can be restarted in a RAD51-depdendent manner \[[@pgen.1005790.ref049], [@pgen.1005790.ref060]--[@pgen.1005790.ref065], [@pgen.1005790.ref070]--[@pgen.1005790.ref073]\]. To test if MUS-30 prevents replication fork collapse or facilitates MEI-3-dependent replication fork restart, we tested for genetic interactions between Δ*mus-30* and Δ*mei-3*. We reasoned that a positive genetic interaction would suggest that MUS-30 facilitates MEI-3 dependent replication fork restart, whereas a negative genetic interaction could suggest MUS-30 is required to prevent collapsed forks at MMS-damaged bases and BER intermediates. We observed a striking synthetic growth defect for Δ*mus-30*; Δ*mei-3* double mutants, which was evident even in the absence of exogenous DNA damaging agents. We performed race tube analysis with multiple isolates of each genotype to quantify the linear growth rate. The growth rates of wildtype, *Δmus-30*, and *Δmei-3* were similar, whereas all isolates of *Δmus-30*; *Δmei-3* double mutants displayed markedly slower growth ([Fig 4D and 4E](#pgen.1005790.g004){ref-type="fig"}). We next tested the level of MMS-sensitivity for each genotype **(**[Fig 4F](#pgen.1005790.g004){ref-type="fig"}). *Δmus-30* and *Δmei-3* single mutants were unable to grow in the presence of 0.015% and 0.010% MMS, respectively, while *Δmus-30; Δmei-3* conidia failed to grow on the lowest MMS concentration tested (0.0001%). Thus, MEI-3 is critical for repairing DNA damage that accumulates in the *Δmus-30* mutant strain. Together, these data demonstrate that MUS-30 is not generally required for DSB repair and suggest that MUS-30 is important for

For the interactive tool, we used regression analysis and computer simulation to quantify the impact of all included factors on the operating room utilization rate. To demonstrate the use of the interactive tool, we give an illustrative example with a limited number of patient groups, namely, orbital, surgical retina, medical retina, and secondary level of care patients. These are the same subspecialties we used to illustrate the data collection in Table [3](#Tab3){ref-type="table"}. The actual tool incorporates all subspecialties of the AMC ophthalmology department.

Before discussing the scenarios, we will first describe the current performance and the preferred performance (see Table [7](#Tab7){ref-type="table"}). For example, in the current situation, at least 80% of the elective medical retina patients experienced a waiting time of less than 9 weeks, while the preferred threshold value for this patient group is 5 weeks, based upon the so-called Treek norm which was set by the Dutch government. Furthermore, the maximum number of cancellations due to overrun of previous surgeries was 7.5 per month on average during the past year, while the preferred performance is a maximum of 4 cancellations per month.

For the first scenario, we determined the maximum allowed utilization rate for the current situation with the current performance and calculated the total demand for the OPD, the nursing ward, and the operating room (see Table [8](#Tab8){ref-type="table"}).

![Gastrografin enema confirmed the fistula was closed.](WJGE-9-95-g004){#F4}

In conclusion, although the OTSC system had mostly been used for treating upper gastrointestinal perfusion and fistulas and fistulas on the top of the pouch are rare and often are cured through surgery, we still suggest attempting OTSC to treat a pouch fistula due to the easy manipulation and reduction of immediate operative intervention rates, and length of hospitalization\[[@B7],[@B8]\]. Even if the endoscopic closure failed, the salvage surgery would still be feasible.

Case characteristics
--------------------

This was a young man with severe ulcerative colitis who received ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) and developed a fistula after surgery.

Clinical diagnosis
------------------

Intestinal fistula.

Differential diagnosis
----------------------

Leaks from the tip of the J-pouch, Anastomotic fistula, Crohn's disease, abscess.

Laboratory diagnosis
--------------------

The patient had a high blood white cell count and fever; thus, he was diagnosed with an intra-abdominal infection.

Imaging diagnosis
-----------------

Leaks from the tip of the J-pouch.

Pathological diagnosis
----------------------

He was cured with non-surgical treatment, and there was no pathological diagnosis.

Treatment
---------

Closed the fistula with the over-the-scope clip (OTSC) system.

Related reports
---------------

A J-pouch is the most common configuration of IPAA used currently. Risk factors for pouch-related sepsis complications include steroid use, a body mass index greater than 30, a patient older than 50 years, diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, and surgeon inexperience. Surgical approaches have always been used for pouch-related sepsis arising from pouch fistula.

Term explanation
----------------

Fistula is a pouch-related septic complication. There are 4 main pouch sources of fistula, including the appendage, pouch reservoir, inflow limb, and pouch-rectal anastomosis. Each can fistulize to different areas, including the abdominal wall, vagina, bladder, and other loops of the small bowel.

Lysates were centrifuged at 10000 g for 15 min at 4°C to remove nuclei and intact cells and the protein concentration was measured. Protein extracts (30 μg) were heat-denatured at 95°C for 5 min with DTT, electrophoresed on 7.5% and 15% polyacrylamide-SDS gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature using 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and incubated overnight at 4°C with affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies against mTOR, phospho-mTOR (Ser2448), phospho-4E-BP1, phospho-p70 S6 kinase (Ser371 and Thr389) (Cat\#9862, Cell Signaling, Boston, MA, USA) and FKBP12 (\#PA1-026A, Thermo Scientific, MA, USA).

A mouse anti-actin antibody (A2066, Sigma-Aldrich) was used to control for protein loading and to normalize expression of proteins of interest. After washing, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-mouse (1:10000; Amersham Biosciences, Bucks, UK) or anti-rabbit (1:7000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies.

Bands were visualized using the supersignal west pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA), quantified using the software gel-pro analyzer (4.0, Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA) and normalized to α-tubulin content. For comparison purposes between young and aged samples, all the α-tubulin-corrected values were normalized to the average of young samples of the same assay.

In mTOR phosphorylation assay, two similar gels were run and one membrane was incubated with the antibody against the total protein and the other with an antiphospho-protein of interest.

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that lung cancer patients with DM had increased PFS and OS compared with those without DM (log-rank, *P* \< 0.05, *P* \< 0.01); the median PFS in lung cancer patients with DM was 12.0 months (95% confidence interval \[CI\], 4.0--16.0) *vs.* 6.0 months in those without DM (95% CI, 5.8--6.3); and the median OS in lung cancer patients with DM was 37.0 months (95% CI, 29.0--46.6) *vs.* 12.0 months in those without DM (95% CI, 10.9--13.1). For the other two groups of patients without DM, there was a trend toward a shorter PFS and OS in patients with elevated blood glucose compared with those without elevated blood glucose \[Figure [1](#F1){ref-type="fig"}\].

Discussion
==========

In the present study, we found a significant survival benefit for lung cancer patients with DM. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that lung cancer patients with DM had increased PFS and OS compared with those without DM, and the median PFS was 12.0 months in lung cancer patients with DM *vs.* 6.0 months in those without DM; the median OS was 37.0 months in lung cancer patients with DM *vs.* 12.0 months in those without DM. Our results were in agreement with those of the previous HUNT and PEG study,^\[[@R13]\]^ but the HUNT and PEG study only demonstrated increased OS in patients with lung cancer with DM compared with those without DM

Importance of promoter elements in the success of genetic transformation {#Sec7_20}
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Commonly, in genetic transformation procedure, after cloning the gene, general promoters such as 35 S are used. However, regarding the key role of promoter for proper function, a special attention should be paid to cloning and transformation of outstanding promoter as well as gene to obtain satisfactory result we suggest that in new transformation activities a. As example, ( \[[@CR9_20]\]) observed that seed-specific promoter is prerequisite for proper function of fatty acid desaturase genes in altering the unsaturated fatty acid content of oilseeds by genetic manipulation expression ( \[[@CR9_20]\]).

Up to now, the majority of researchers just considered individual gene to predict gene function. The approach employed in this research considering coexpressed gene with gene of interest and promoter analysis, as well as illustrating prosite structure can result in reveal valuable findings about protein function in different pathway. In particular, the unique regulatory elements (responding to different sorts of stresses) open a new avenue in genetic engineering trough manipulating of cis-acting regulatory elements on promoter region.

Conclusion {#Sec8_20}
==========

Here, for the first time, we demonstrated that promoter analysis of TLPs and OLPs can explain multiple roles of TLPs and OLPs in biotic and abiotic stresses. In addition, we showed that analysis of coexpressed genes with gene of interest analysis can provide valuable insight in dtertmination of diverse role of genes. In conclusion, our results revealed that, new computational tools such as coexpressed gene analysis, cis regulatory analysis and *in silico* protein analysis can identify the outstanding TLPs and OLPs homologue involving in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Discovering the genes with dual resistance functions in biotic and abiotic stresses is a major advance in genetic transformation. Furthermore, the present methods can be efficiently employed in discovering the unknown function of genes.

Case Report {#sec1-2}
===========

An 11-year-old girl, born of full-term pregnancy which was complicated by prolonged labor, who had delayed speech, impairment in domains of communication, self-care, work, academic, interpersonal and social skills since early childhood presented with a history characterized by difficulties with sustained attention, distraction, poor compliance with instruction, loosing things, jumping and hopping around, not waiting for her turn during play, and interrupting parents when they would be interacting, since the age of 4 years. These symptoms increased over the years and were thought to be more than the appropriate mental age and led to marked dysfunction in social and school functioning. At the age of 6 years, she was diagnosed as having ADHD, combined type (as per DSM-IV), with moderate mental retardation (intelligence quotient of 46) at a tertiary care center and the parents were advised to follow the behavioral measures. There was no family or personal history suggestive of head injury, epilepsy, psychosis, affective disorders or substance abuse.

At the index assessment at the age of 11 years, the child fulfilled the diagnosis of ADHD, combined type (as per DSM-IV), with moderate mental retardation. Her body weight was 26 kg and physical examination did not reveal any abnormality. On investigation, her magnetic resonance imaging of brain, electroencephalogram, hemogram, serum electrolytes, renal function and liver function tests were found to be within normal limits. In view of the marked psychosocial dysfunction and failure to respond to behavioral measures in the past, she was prescribed methylphenidate 10 mg/day, which she tolerated well. After 1 week, the dose of methylphenidate was increased to 15 mg/day in divided doses. However, on the 4^th^ day of increase in dose, she was found to be restless (more than the past) with constant fidgeting, started running around, shouting, screaming and would bite family members if any attempt was made to calm her down. She spoke loudly at faster pace, hummed tunes and demanded for various food items and toys. However, she was able to recognize the parents and was aware of place and there was no history of abnormal involuntary movements. Also, she did not sleep throughout the night. Next day she was brought to the psychiatry OPD in a state of extreme agitation, running all

Large-particle flow cytometry has also been applied to the screening and sorting of microencapsulated particles, cells, and organisms, such as fungal spores encapsulated in calcium alginate beads^[@CR18]^. A recent investigation that immobilised several species of coral propagules in an agarose gel found that survival of immobilised larvae was high, and that the encapsulation process did not significantly impede larval settlement after immobilisation^[@CR42]^. A work flow could be developed whereby the output from automated encapsulation feeds directly into a large-particle flow cytometer to measure and sort individually-encapsulated particles. Alternatively, the flow cytometer could be used to deposit larvae directly into an encapsulation medium for down-stream applications.

With an egg diameter of approximately 500 µm^[@CR43]^ and a larval length of \~ 750 µm, *Montipora capitata* propagules were well suited to the 1,000 µm fluidics and optics core assembly (FOCA) unit tested here. Coral propagules span a considerable size range, however, from \~ 80 µm for the small broadcast spawning *Lobactis scutaria* (syn. *Fungia scutaria*)^[@CR44]^ to the large \~ 1,500--2000 µm planula larvae released by some brooders, such as *Pocillopora* spp.^[@CR45]^ and *Favia* spp.^[@CR46]^. The instruments tested here can comfortably accommodate particles from 20 to 1,500 µm in diameter, across their range of flow-cell sizes (up to 2000 µm), and are thus compatible with the vast majority of broadcast spawning coral species, and many brooding species. Other marine organisms with adult or larval stages within this size range, such as zooplankton tested by Henzler et al.^[@CR17]^, would also be suitable for study with these instruments.

In this period of rapid ocean warming, large-scale and high-throughput methodologies are more important than ever, to advance basic and applied research into the early life-history stages of corals quickly and efficiently. We tested one such method, and conclude that gentle, large-particle flow cytometry can rapidly and efficiently sort live coral propagules based on spectral properties and size. Further development of this technique offers rapid characterisation and quantification of both wild-caught and laboratory-cultured coral propagules.

INTRODUCTION {#sec1-1}
============

One of the main consequences of brain injury is coma. Coma is defined as a state of impaired consciousness that the patient is unresponsiveness so that cannot response to the environment stimulations and cannot be aroused.\[[@ref1]\] Today, the amount of brain injury in the world has increased rapidly, so that each year about two million people are suffering from brain damage in the United States.\[[@ref2]\] One of the most common complications resulting from impacts to the head is intracranial hematoma, which is depending on the position divided into epidural, subdural and intracerebral hematomas. In the study of traumatic coma data bank (TCDB), 58% of all of the patients who underwent hematoma discharge and 21% of all of the patients who had severe head trauma suffering subdural hematoma and the most common cause of acute subdural hematoma is accidents.\[[@ref3]\] In this type of hematoma as blood accumulates in the subdural space, however, pressure on the brain increases and subsequently causing acute neurological disorders. Intracranial hematoma, including subdural hematoma, can be associated with life-threatening complications such as coma.\[[@ref4]\] Comatose persons may stay in coma for long periods and when they come out of coma they will face with motor and cognitive impairments.\[[@ref5]\] In addition to these dysfunctions, another threatening complication in comatose patients which is gained less attention is sensory deprivation.\[[@ref6]\] Staying in environments with limited exposure to sensory stimuli, such as intensive care units (ICU), increases the risk of sensory deprivation in patients and have some effects like perceptual, cognitive and emotional impairments on patients.\[[@ref7][@ref8]\] One of the steps that can be done to prevent sensory deprivation in comatose patients is using the sensory stimulation through sensory stimulation programs. Sensory stimulation programs for comatose patients through stimulating the reticular activating system and increasing the level of cognitive functioning stimulate the brain and cause the patients come out of coma as soon as possible and achieve to optimal performance levels.\[[@ref6]\] Onset of sensory stimulation on the first 72 hours after brain injury has a great importance in saving the patient\'s life, improving quality of life, and prognosis of the disease.\[[@ref9]\] In this regard Hyunsoon and Whasook (2003) wrote: To facilitate the healing process and prevent the sensory deprivation in comatose patients with traumatic brain injury using the organized sensory stimulation programs in the early stages after brain injury

We compared standard TURP, TUVRP, and holmium laser resection/enucleation of the prostate. This study replicated the results of the previous study and revealed the excellent hemostatic property of the holmium laser with less perioperative morbidity. However, the laser surgery requires special equipment and is associated with a learning curve.\[[@CIT4]\]

We also studied the role of TUVRP in prostates weighing more than 70 grams and found that any size prostate can be easily resected with minimal morbidity. TUVRP provides fast resectability of the prostate adenoma with good homeostasis and a short hospital stay.\[[@CIT5]\]

Various groups have reported other alternatives such as HOLEP for surgical management of a large volume prostate.\[[@CIT6]--[@CIT11]\] HOLEP requires surgical expertise and special equipment, which is available only in a few centers worldwide. With the use of bipolar energy and saline for irrigation, the size of the prostate gland is no longer a limitation for TURP. Other advantages of bipolar TURP are less bleeding, short catheter time, and shorter hospital stay. Bipolar TURP is a safe and effective procedure associated with fewer side effects and could result in the procedure being more attractive for high-risk patients, as well as for training purposes.\[[@CIT12]\]

The cost and availability of the equipment is an important factor in developing countries. The initial cost of laser machines is high and the cost of fiber is added in every case. In the case of laser enucleation, bare fibers can be reused but in vaporization procedures, one or sometimes more than one fiber is required. Apart from this, there is a high maintenance cost and additional hazards associated with laser machines. In comparison, TURP equipment is easily available, cheap with minimum maintenance cost, and is available with every urologist as basic equipment.

It is important that a surgical procedure should be durable and not require repeat procedures for the same disease. The long-term outcomes of TURP are good. Patients who undergo laser vaporization may require repeat procedure/TURP during follow-up. Vavassori reported a re-intervention rate of 2.7% for residual adenoma whereas Elzayat and Elhilali reported a re-treatment rate of 8% in their series.\[[@CIT11][@CIT13]\] The large variety of lasers and techniques of laser prostatectomy shows that none is perfect so far. There is a steep learning curve for laser prostatectomy and this

In patients who would undergo only gastrostomy, after the insertion of a camera trocar, a 3-to-5 mm working trocar was inserted through the incision made on the lateral aspect of the right lateral rectus muscle on the left upper quadrant. The avascular area of the greater curvature was held with an atraumatic grasper, and the left-sided trocar was pulled up. Then the gastrostomy tract was opened, and the trocar was fixed to the fascia. Afterwards, a camera port was inserted to control the gastrostomy tract before the procedure termination.

Postoperative Period {#sec2-3}
--------------------

Twenty-four hours after the operation, the patients started to be fed with the infusion of nutrients delivered through the gastrostomy tube, and the amount of nutrition was gradually increased. During the hospitalization period, the parents of the patients were taught to use the gastrostomy tube and nutrition machine, and they were also taught about the gastrostomy care. Patients were discharged after switching to total parenteral diet if they did not have any additional diseases requiring further hospitalization. After discharge, the patients were followed up at home by nutrition nurses, and the families were helped with relevant issues.

Results {#sec1-3}
=======

Forty-nine (38.3%) patients were female and 79 (61.7%) were male. The mean age was 50 months (1 day--18 years), and the mean patient weight was 13 kg (2300 gr--65 kg). Neurological disease with swallowing dysfunction was detected in 105 (82%), persistent, but unexplained vomiting in 7 (5.5%), long-term esophageal atresia in 5 (3.9%), corrosive esophagus in 3 (1.5%), arthrogryposis multiplex in 2 (1.6%), and vocal cord paralysis and vocal cord paralysis, Pierre--Robin syndrome, multiple congenital anomalies, and glycogen storage disease Type 1 were detected in 1 patient each.

The mean duration of surgery was only 44 min (30--60 min) in LG-treated patients and 80 min (80--210 min) in 116 patients with simultaneous fundoplication. Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication was performed in all patients. Fourteen patients underwent nasopharyngeal fundoplication and gastrostomy with simultaneous bronchoscopy-guided percutaneous tracheostomy. One patient underwent cholecystectomy, and the Meckel diverticulum of another patient was excised. One

![RNA--RNA interactions in pre-activated and activated spliceosomes\
(**A**) The pre-activated spliceosome contains five snRNAs. U1 snRNA base-pairs with the 5′ splice site and U2 snRNA base-pairs with the branch site with a stem IIa structure. U2/U6 helix II has been shown to be required for tri-snRNP recruitment in mammalian cells. Loop I of U5 snRNA interacts with two broad regions of exon 1. (**B**) On the activated spliceosome, base-pairings of the 5′ splice site with U1 are displaced by U6. In addition, the Lsm complex is dissociated from U6 to allow interactions of its 3′ end with the intron sequence in a region downstream from the 5′ splice site.](bsr314i003){#F3}

The NTC was shown to be required for spliceosome activation after the release of U1 and U4 \[[@B81]\]. The binding of NTC does not require much of the sequence downstream of the branchpoint \[[@B124]\], but how it is recruited to the spliceosome remains unknown. The NTC is required for stabilizing the association of U5 and U6 with the spliceosome in formation of the active spliceosome \[[@B81]\]. In the absence of the NTC, both U5 and U6 interact with the pre-mRNA in a dynamic manner after U1 and U4 are released, as revealed by UV-cross-linking analysis. The presence of the NTC renders base-pairings of U5 and U6 with defined residues of the pre-mRNA \[[@B81],[@B82]\]. The binding of the NTC also promotes the release of Lsm proteins from U6 to allow for the interaction of the Lsm-binding site near the 3′-end of U6 snRNA with the intron in a region approximately 30 bp downstream from the 5′ splice site \[[@B81]\].

CATALYTIC STEPS
===============

After pairing of U6 to the 5′ splice site and to U2 snRNA, the catalytic core of the spliceosome is established and stabilized by the binding of the NTC and protein components of snRNPs. The splicing reaction is completed via two consecutive transesterification reactions on the activated spliceosome. The first step is cleavage at the 5′ splice site and formation of the lariat intron--exon 2 via a 2′--5′ phosphodiester linkage.

While bilayer studies have clearly shown the capacity of annexins to translocate Ca^2+^ and K^+^, few studies have addressed *in vivo* transport function. As, in common with animal annexins, plant annexins are firmly implicated in exocytosis \[[@B50-plants-03-00128]\], analysis of loss of function mutants may not yield clear-cut results. The absence of a conductance could be due to a failure in annexin-mediated exocytotic delivery of a channel subunit to a membrane rather than a failure in annexin-mediated ion transport itself. In fairness, there are caveats also to the interpretation of conventional channel mutants; for example, loss of transport function could be due to a pleiotropic effect of the mutation. The safeguard is to examine the protein's transport activity *in vitro*, without the confounding effects of a cellular expression system, whether native or heterologous. Does the *in vitro* transport match that of the membrane?

4. *In Vivo* Activity and Functions of AtANN1
=============================================

The root epidermal and root hair apical plasma membrane of *Arabidopsis* contain a hyperpolarisation-activated Ca^2+^-permeable channel conductance that is activated by extracellular hydroxyl radicals (OH^●^) and is involved in growth \[[@B11-plants-03-00128],[@B51-plants-03-00128],[@B52-plants-03-00128]\]. Using patch clamp electrophysiology, an *Atann1* knockout mutant was found to lack this Ca^2+^ conductance in both epidermal and root hair apical plasma membrane, with activity restored by complementation. The transport characteristics of the OH^●^-activated Ca^2+^ conductance generated by recombinant AtANN1 in planar lipid bilayers agree well with that of the native membrane, strongly supporting AtANN1's direct formation of this transport pathway. Root epidermal protoplasts from the mutant were significantly impaired in their ability to elevate \[Ca^2+^\]~cyt~ in response to extracellular OH^●^, consistent with a Ca^2+^ transport function for AtANN1 \[[@B11-plants-03-00128]\]. Mutant roots and root hairs were significantly shorter than wild type, consistent with impaired Ca^2+^ uptake \[[@B11-plants-03-00128]\].

Recent work has shown that AtANN1 is involved in root \[Ca^2+^\]~cyt~ elevation in response to hydrogen peroxide, using aequorin as a \[Ca^2

Five coated brackets and five uncoated brackets were used for the direct contact test (which is more accurate than the disk diffusion test).

Each of the 10 brackets was placed in a separate micro-tube containing 1 mL of brain heart infusion broth culture medium. The Streptococcus mutans strains (1683PTCC) reached the standard 0.5 McFarland concentration, and were then diluted in 1:10 ratio; 5 μL of this suspension were then poured into each tube containing 1 mL of the culture. The microtubes were incubated at 37°C and after periods of three, six, 24 and 48 hours and 15 and 30 days, 10 μL of the suspension were taken from each microtube (five coated, and five uncoated) and cultured on a separate blood agar culture medium. These cultures were incubated at 37°C for 24--48 hours and the colonies, each composed of a single set of cultures, were counted after each period. Bacterial counts of lower than 500 in the culture medium of the diluted 0.5 McFarland standard concentration were attributed to the antibacterial effect of Ag. The mean and standard deviation of bacterial count in each of the 60 cultures were determined after each period.

Statistical analysis
--------------------

The statistical significance was assessed using SPSS version 18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and Student's t-test for comparing groups in each period of time and repeated measures ANOVA for comparing bacterial counts at different time points in each group. Significance was set at P \< 0.05.

The surface morphology of the specimens was examined under SEM and AFM. The SEM micrographs showed that the Ag coatings had a uniform thickness. Moreover, the AFM analysis revealed that the coatings were homogeneous, and had an average particle size and surface roughness of 370nm and 181nm, respectively.

------------------------------------------------

Addition of 0.1 µM doxycycline to the media of both DKO-S and DKO-R cells completely repressed clathrin expression ([Figure 1](#pone-0106278-g001){ref-type="fig"}). DT40 cells are typically grown in media supplemented with 10% foetal-calf serum (FCS) and 1% chicken serum [@pone.0106278-Buerstedde1]. We previously showed that when DKO-S cells were seeded into this standard medium in the presence of doxycycline, the clathrin-depleted cells died by apoptosis after 3--4 days, reflecting the decline in the level of clathrin over this period. The cells died more quickly when clathrin-depleted DKO-S cells were grown in the presence of 10% FCS, but only 0.25% chicken serum [@pone.0106278-Wettey1]. This suggests that chicken serum contains a factor required by DKO-S cells that becomes growth limiting in the absence of clathrin. To investigate the nature of this factor, we first extended the growth experiments to include a wider range of chicken serum concentrations (0 to 5%) ([Figure S1A and S1B](#pone.0106278.s001){ref-type="supplementary-material"}). The inhibitory effect of clathrin-depletion on cell growth was particularly dramatic at low levels of chicken serum (0.25%). When seeded into medium lacking chicken serum altogether, DKO-S cells grew noticeably less well even when expressing clathrin, and they needed a seeding density of at least 2×10^4^ cells/ml to grow. In the absence of clathrin, DKO-S cells in this medium died rapidly. By contrast we found that at chicken serum concentrations higher than normally used (up to 5%), DKO-S cells increasingly survived clathrin-depletion ([Figure S1A](#pone.0106278.s001){ref-type="supplementary-material"}). Presumably, at this high concentration the increased availability of the potential factor helped the cells to survive longer when clathrin expression was repressed.

These data are encouraging, but it is unclear whether the results generalize to smokers recruited through commercially-funded quitlines. In contrast to state-funded quitlines, which reach smokers of lower socio-economic status and are often limited to persons with no private health insurance, commercial quitlines are typically funded by health plans or employers. As such, they reach tobacco users who are of higher socioeconomic status and, therefore, may have different oral health needs, interests and intervention opportunities. The current paper examines self-report oral health indicators, behavioral oral health risk factors, motivation for behavior change, and interest in oral health promotion among medically-insured smokers receiving tobacco quitline services. We sought to replicate the outcomes previously reported among state quitline participants and to extend them by examining additional indicators of oral disease, behavioral risk behaviors, and motivation for change. These findings not only enhance our understanding of smokers' oral health needs, but will help inform future efforts to design oral health promotion programs that can be integrated into the standard counseling offered to smokers through tobacco quitlines.

Methods
=======

Participants
------------

Callers were surveyed from a commercially-funded quitline offered to members of a regional U.S. health plan through their medical insurance (n = 455). All participants lived in Washington state and were insured by Group Health Cooperative. Tobacco users who consecutively enrolled in the quitline program between July and September 2011 were identified using health plan enrollment files and quitline intake data. Enrollees who were adult smokers at the time of intake and had reported that they could read and write in English (n = 829) were each mailed a written survey and a \$2 pre-incentive in February 2012. Invitees who failed to return their survey within several weeks after the first mailing received a second reminder mailing. Fifty-five percent of those invited returned surveys and received \$20 as a thank you. One non-responder was learned to be deceased. All data collection was conducted by the Group Health Research Institute. All study activities were approved by the Group Health Institutional Review Board.

Assessment measures and analyses
--------------------------------

Assessment measures included standardized items from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the Center for Disease Control's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey (BRFSS). Items included socio-demographic variables, dental insurance status (yes/no), lifetime smoking and current tobacco use (smoked even a puff in the past 7 days \[yes

6.  1.1 mM L-tyrosine Standard stock solution. Prepared using 0.2 mg/ml L-tyrosine in purified water and heated gently until the tyrosine dissolves. As with the casein, do not boil this solution. Allow the L-tyrosine standard to cool to room temperature. This solution will be diluted further to make our standard curve.

7.  Protease solution. Immediately before use, dissolve protease in enzyme diluent solution prepared in step 6.

If necessary, use a solid protease sample of predetermined activity, which is dissolved using enzyme diluent to 0.1-0.2 units/ml. This solution serves as a positive control for the quality control assay and as validation for the calculations we will perform to determine enzyme activity.

Setting up the Protease Assay and Standard Curves
-------------------------------------------------

1.  To begin this assay, find suitable vials that will hold about 15 mls. For each enzyme that will be tested, 4 vials are needed. One vial will be used as a blank, and three others will be used to assay activity of three dilutions of the protease. Three dilutions are useful when checking final calculations against each other. To each set of four vials, add 5mls of our 0.65% casein solution. Let them equilibrate in a water bath at 37°C for about 5 minutes.Add varying volumes of enzyme solution that will be tested to three of the test sample vials, but not the blank. Mix by swirling and incubate for 37°C for exactly ten minutes. The protease activity and consequential liberation of tyrosine during this incubation time is what will be measured and compared between test samples.

2.  After this 10 minute incubation, add the 5 mls of the TCA reagent to each tube to stop the reaction. Then, add an appropriate volume of enzyme solution to each tube, even the blank, so that the final volume of enzyme solution in each tube is 1 ml. This is done to account for the absorbance value of the enzyme itself and to ensure that the final volume in each tube is equal. Incubate the solutions at 37°C for 30 minutes.During this 30 minute incubation, you may want to set up your tyrosine standard dilutions. Use 6 dram vials (dram vials can be substituted with polypropylene tubes) that can easily hold 8 mls. To the six vials, add the 1.1 mM

The use of e-nose based on ultra-fast gas chromatography equipped with unsupervised and supervised chemometric methods is an effective tool for authentication fruit juice samples. This technique allows to omit sample preparation step and provides a low time-consuming single analysis. Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that using HCA methods allowed to classify orange juice samples for unadulterated and adulterated with apple juice. Unfortunately, samples of orange juice containing 1.0% of apple juice were assigned to the group of unadulterated samples. More reliable results were achieved through the use of supervised statistical methods. The combination of e-nose measurements with Random Forest classifier made it possible to distinguish between particular orange juice samples based on the added volume of apple juice. The obtained results are the basis for further investigations. In the near future, the focus should be placed on the developed methodology, in which samples of fruit nectars and juices from concentrate will be considered. They are one of the most falsified ones.

Experimental {#Sec4}
============

Sample preparation {#Sec5}
------------------

Fruit juices were obtained at local distribution centres in Gdansk. Samples were NFC juices, i.e., orange juice, apple juice, and mixtures of orange and apple juice (1/3/5/10/30/50% v/v addition of apple juice). The juice mixtures were prepared immediately after their purchase. A sample of 5.0 ± 0.1 g of each fruit juice was poured into 20 cm^3^ glass vials that were then sealed with a cap with a silicone--PTFE membrane. Samples were stored for 24 h at 4 °C. For each type of samples, the analyses were performed in ten replicates.

Instrumentation {#Sec6}
---------------

The measurements were performed using an ultra-fast gas chromatograph Heracles II (Alpha MOS, Toulouse, France) equipped with a split/splitless injector and two flame ionization detectors (μFIDs). The two parallel linked capillary chromatographic columns used for separation were non-polar MXT-5 (diphenyl dimethylpolysiloxane, 10 m × 0.18 mm × 0.40 μm) and medium-polar MXT-1701 (cyanopropylphenyl polysiloxane, 10 m × 0.18 mm × 0.40 μm).

The histologic spectrum encountered in acute lung injury is broad. Very early cases may look nearly normal with only mild interstitial and alveolar edema. Other more advanced cases are clearly abnormal with fibrin, inflammation, and organization. The basic elements of the acute injury pattern include interstitial edema, alveolar edema, fibrin, hyaline membranes, reactive pneumocytes, and organization (see [Box 6.2](#b0015){ref-type="boxed-text"}). Acute lung injury is a pathologic pattern and by itself is a nonspecific finding. From a practical perspective, after an acute lung injury pattern is identified, careful search for the following additional features often help to narrow the list of possible causes (summarized in [Table 6.1](#t0010){ref-type="table"} ).*Presence of hyaline membranes*. The most commonly encountered potential etiologic disorders include infection, connective tissue disease, drug toxicity, and an idiopathic form of diffuse alveolar damage (i.e., acute interstitial pneumonia).[@bib2], [@bib5]*Presence of neutrophils*. The presence of neutrophils in lung alveolar spaces should always raise the possibility of infection.[@bib121], [@bib134] For example, legionnaires\' disease characteristically is associated with acute bronchopneumonia with DAD.[@bib51]*Presence of frothy exudates*. The presence of frothy exudates in alveolar spaces is a classic feature of pneumocystis pneumonia. However, this feature is not always present. In some cases, especially in mildly immunocompromised patients, DAD may be the only finding.[@bib46]*Presence of necrosis*. Among the infectious causes of DAD, viral infection figures prominently. Influenzavirus, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, and adenovirus infections are well known to produce DAD,[@bib29], [@bib31], [@bib34], [@bib35], [@bib36] and all of these viral infections typically are accompanied by necrosis. *Legionella* and *Pneumocystis* infections also can produce acute lung injury with necrosis.[@bib44], [@bib46], [@bib51]*Presence of eosinophils*. Acute and organizing DAD with prominent interstitial and alveolar eosinophils is characteristic of acute eosinophilic pneumonia.[@bib104] However, if the patient has been treated with steroid before biopsy, very few eosinophils may remain, and the diagnosis may be difficult or impossible.*Presence of siderophages and capillaritis*. Hemosiderin-laden macrophages with

Data from six randomized clinical trials in CLL and one with MM patients with hypogammaglobulinemia and history of infections demonstrated that IVIg significantly decreased the rate of bacterial infections and prolonged the time to first infection, with no differences in non-bacterial infections (Table [1](#T1){ref-type="table"}). These trials suggested that the best dosing was 400 mg/kg/3 weeks until steady state is reached, followed by 400 mg/kg/5 weeks (grade A recommendation, level 1b evidence) ([@B4]--[@B6], [@B29]--[@B33]). Although infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in CLL, neither survival benefit nor improvement in quality of life could be demonstrated, which is not surprising given the follow-up period of 1 year ([@B4], [@B34]). A recent 14-year retrospective study in a large series of CLL patients confirmed that hypogammaglobulinemia does not appear to impact overall survival ([@B14]). Based on the results of the first controlled trial in a wide range of CLL patients, IVIg was not cost-effective ([@B35]). In patients with MM, IVIg for 6--12 months reduced the risk of severe infectious complications (grade A recommendation, level 1b evidence) ([@B31]). As a result, IVIg is currently reserved for selected CLL patients with hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent bacterial infections, especially those in whom prophylactic antibiotics have failed, or with severe infections requiring IV antibiotics or hospitalization and serum IgG levels \<400 mg/dL (grade 2B recommendation, level 1A of evidence). Following the original trial, IVIg may be recommended for plateau phase MM patients with hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent bacterial infections who have failed to respond to pneumococcal immunization ([@B36], [@B37]).

Various institutional actors differ in terms of their powers to affect an organisation\'s outcome. The Chinese government, for instance, can exert a higher level of control on China-based technology companies. Their responses can be described as a habit -- 'unconscious or blind adherence to preconscious or taken for granted rules or values' (Oliver, 1991: 152).

Western technology companies, however, are required to appease a diverse set of competing institutions. These companies thus are required to decouple their responses.

Different theoretical contributions and various empirical studies have led to the accepted view that the exact nature of decoupling is a function of the perception of relative powers of competing organisational and institutional interests (Pfeffer, 1981a, 1981b; March and Olsen, 1989; Oliver, 1991; Zajac and Westphal, 1995; Westphal and Zajac, 1998, 2001). These studies also provide support for the notion that substantial responses cannot be made to appease actors that diametrically oppose one another. More to the point, the substantive response relates to the threat or opportunity associated with the actor that is perceived to be more powerful and the symbolic response relates to the threat or opportunity associated with the actor perceived to possess less power (George et al., 2006).

In this regard, it is important to note that China\'s online transactions were estimated at US\$125 billion in 2006 (Asia Pulse, 2006a). The Chinese government thus possesses enormous power over these multinationals. To gain access to the huge Chinese e-commerce market, Western organisations appear willing to take actions that are non-isomorphic with respect to their home country institutions.

To substantiate this claim, we began by arguing that the Chinese government has built 'The Great Firewall of China' with the help of foreign companies such as Cisco Systems (Gutmann, 2002; Shie, 2004). Cisco also provided China with hardware specifically designed to assist China\'s cyber police to conduct surveillance of electronic communications (Jasper, 2006). About a quarter of the vendors at the Security China 2000 trade show, many of them foreign firms, were marketing products aimed at enhancing China\'s 'Golden Shield' (Fackler, 2000). In short, many Western technology companies have chosen 'to co-opt the source of the pressure' related to cyber-control (Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978; Burt, 1983; Oliver, 1991: 157).

The larger amount of Fn adsorbed onto HAP1 particles as compared with HAP2 particles is in agreement with previous work showing a decrease in Fn adsorption with increasing size of HAP nanoparticles.^[@ref25]^ Adsorption of serum proteins has also been found to increase on polymer scaffolds containing smaller and less crystalline HAP nanoparticles.^[@ref35]^ It should be noted that our results in Figure [4](#fig4){ref-type="fig"}B indicate the amount of Fn adsorbed per unit volume and may not be relevant to Fn adsorbed per unit surface area onto the nanoparticles. Each voxel (0.4 × 0.4 × 1.0 μm^3^) can accommodate approximately 10K of HAP1 or 1K of HAP2 nanoparticles (assuming reasonable thickness). Additionally, single HAP1 particles have higher surface area to volume ratios than single HAP2 particles. Thus, the higher level of fluorescence measured for HAP1 compared to HAP2 could result from both the larger quantity and larger surface area of HAP1 particles per voxel, even if the same amount of Fn adsorbed per unit surface area onto HAP1 and HAP2 particles. However, our FRET results in Figure [4](#fig4){ref-type="fig"}A suggest that Fn adopts a more compact conformation and hence takes less space when adsorbed onto HAP1, implying that there could be more Fn adsorbed per unit surface area on HAP1 compared to HAP2.

Moreover, we observe a correlation between the quantity and the conformation of Fn adsorbed, with larger Fn amounts correlating systematically to more compact Fn conformations. This correlation can be attributed either to a reduced space available for each Fn molecule adsorbed or to protein--protein interactions that stabilize compact Fn conformation at high surface coverage (in particular on HAP1 surface). Our data are in agreement with previous work reporting a similar relationship between the interfacial concentration and conformation of Fn adsorbed onto hydrophobic polystyrene, in which the authors suggested that molecular packing and protein--protein interactions at high Fn bulk concentration reduced Fn molecular unfolding.^[@ref40]^ On hydrophilic surfaces, such as mica, the orientation and conformation of Fn have been shown to depend on surface coverage as well, where increasing specific interactions with collagen-related peptides is observed at higher surface coverage.^[@ref41]^ In fact, our FRET results show that Fn molecules adsorbed onto atomically smooth mica at very low bulk concentration (50 μg/

2. Materials and Methods {#sec2-materials-12-01885}
========================

The workflow ([Figure 1](#materials-12-01885-f001){ref-type="fig"}) follows a typical multiscale approach \[[@B31-materials-12-01885]\] where microscopic behaviour is described using a representative volume element (RVE) and global response is simulated using homogenisation of the RVE (first step). Statistical representation of the microstructure is evaluated by varying the RVE size until stabilization of homogenised properties occurs, i.e., a statistical volume element (SVE) is obtained. The sensitivity of the homogenised properties to changes in constituent properties, i.e., fiber and matrix properties, are analysed with the aim of assessing the importance of individual input parameters, since not all of them are necessarily well known. Homogenised properties can be measured experimentally \[[@B32-materials-12-01885]\], but the goal here is that no experimental calibration \[[@B33-materials-12-01885]\] or inverse micromechanics is used. There are two reasons for this: First, experimental work can be expensive and time-consuming if it is needed every time an input parameter changes. Second, using inverse micromechanics or model calibration makes experimental validation redundant. The second step in the workflow is to insert the homogenised properties into a macroscopic model, which takes the component geometry, boundary conditions and load cases into consideration. The response of the macroscopic model can be validated experimentally by loading the component and comparing measured strain values with simulated strain. The macroscopic model is used to identify critical areas in the structure. The third step in the workflow involves using the critical locations for defining displacements and boundary conditions for the RVE so that they are relevant with the practical application in mind. The effect of known defects found using advanced non-destructive testing \[[@B16-materials-12-01885]\] or postulated defects can now be evaluated in microscale with loading conditions relevant to real-life applications. The simulated failure strength of a defective component can thus be calculated and compared to experimentally obtained failure loads. Ideally, this process allows the estimation of residual strength of a defective component based on in-service inspection results.

The macroscopic model and case study presented in this paper is three-point bending of a pultruded UD CFRP beam. Constituent properties and micrographs are used to create the RVE and to obtain homogenised composite properties. The critical location is identified from the

Opioids are used for successful cancer pain management and adequate analgesia without excessive adverse effects in patients \[[@B1]\]. The availability and consumption of opioids have increased, and opioids other than morphine, such as oxycodone, have become more widely used. These drugs affect three types of the opioid receptor and subtypes of *μ* receptors differently \[[@B2], [@B3]\]. Therefore, individual variations in response to opioids must be considered in the management of cancer pain. Oxycodone and morphine have distinctly different pharmacological profiles; however, constipation during oxycodone treatment also occurs like in morphine treatment \[[@B4]\].

2. Case Report {#sec2}
==============

A 54-year-old man was referred to the emergency department for severe abdominal pain and diarrhea. He had undergone radiotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the external auditory canal six months before; however, he underwent additional radiotherapy again for recurrence of disease. He was otherwise healthy and with no history of abdominal diseases. He had taken oxycodone 10 mg daily for moderate to severe cancer pain in the ear. Initially, he did not complain of constipation, and his cancer pain was well controlled. However, the pain gradually increased over a period of several months, and the dose of oxycodone was increased to 80 mg. His ear pain then worsened and he suddenly became constipated. His dose of oxycodone was then increased to 100 mg, and he was given magnesium hydrochloride for the constipation. However, he self-medicated with oxycodone at dosages of up to 180 mg/day.

After five days, he suddenly complained of diarrhea, hence, the laxative was stopped. However, his diarrhea worsened, and acute, severe abdominal pain occurred 6 days after the development of diarrhea, and then he visited the emergency department. An abdominal exam showed a flat, slightly hard abdomen with normal bowel sounds. He showed tenderness in the mid-lower abdomen, but no rebound tenderness. Digital examination of the rectum was performed, and hard stool was detected. Abdominal radiography showed a large amount of gas in the colon, and a computed tomography scan also showed colonic gas and a large stool mass blocking the rectum ([Figure 1](#fig1){ref-type="fig"}). This patient was treated with hydration and stool extraction, and the abdominal pain gradually ceased. His pain is now well controlled by percutaneous fentanyl administration.

3. Discussion {#sec3

Few investigations have been conducted to ascertain the job satisfaction of certified physicians in PHCFs in Shandong province following China's recent health system reforms. Accordingly, the current study has been conducted in order to help policymakers to improve strategies designed to enhance physicians' job satisfaction.

Methods {#Sec3}
=======

Study design {#Sec4}
------------

This study was designed to analyse current working conditions and to measure the job satisfaction of certified physicians working in PHCFs in rural Shandong in order to ascertain the factors influencing job satisfaction.

Sampling {#Sec5}
--------

Shandong Province, one of China's typical densely populated and economically developed regions, governs 17 prefectural-level cities. It has a good medical personnel foundation. By the end of 2016, there were 643,000 health care technicians in Shandong Province, of whom 245,000 were certified physicians, including 126,000 physicians working in rural areas. There is uneven economic development and an imbalance in medical resources among the eastern, middle, and western parts of Shandong Province. Therefore, a thorough survey of the job satisfaction of certified physicians in Shandong would provide general and representative data. Stratified random sampling was used in this study. It is a fact that the economy of Shandong is more developed in the east and less towards the west. First, two prefectural-level cities were randomly selected from the economically developed areas in the east, the developing areas in the middle, and the less-developed areas in the west, for a total of 6 prefectural-level cities. Second, two counties in each city were randomly selected, for a total of 12 counties. Finally, 12 CHs and 30 THs were randomly selected in those counties. In total, 540 copies of a questionnaire were distributed to certified physicians at the selected PHCFs. Trained research assistants distributed and collected the questionnaire. The survey was conducted from June to August 2016. Valid responses were received from 495 physicians (valid response rate: 91.6%). The questionnaire was anonymous and all participants provided informed consent prior to the study.

Instrument {#Sec6}
----------

A review of the literature indicated that many instruments have been used to investigate the job satisfaction of different groups of people, such as village doctors, THC employees, and community health workers \[[@CR31], [@CR36]--[@CR41]\]. However, those tools were not conductive to the aim of the current study. The

\"N9: above all, patients just need to feel that they can just talk; it's about them ... how things get sorted out, wee things and feelings get picked up\"

The motivator to overcoming any uncertainly was the development through interaction of the patient-nurse relationship (which was valued highly where it existed). Nurse participants recognised that a patient's emphasis upon the 'expert' 'knowing best' created an imbalance in their relationship.

Participants revealed how they created and sustained meanings and understandings of healthcare and nursing by talking about their changing expectations and beliefs and relating them to the present day. Meanings emerge in local contexts and situations through interaction with others, and wider historical understandings are drawn upon to do so \[[@B48],[@B49],[@B52]\]. The emergence of meanings is an achievement in everyday life in which meanings are created and sustained in performance in interaction \[[@B50]\].

For the participants, creating and sustaining meanings and understandings emerged in, and of, interaction as it took place. In the process of creating meaning within interaction, patients and nurses draw upon the past to perform in the present -- an evolutionary process in which the past articulates with the present.

In this process, some past meanings are sustained and new meanings are created about how to perform in interaction. Their expectations and beliefs have or are changing as a consequence of their contemporary experiences:

\"P9: It's daft when you think about it... only going to the health centre when you're ill... it's no called the illness centre. Years ago health didn't come into it much at all... as they say; the future of the community depends on health. At least now, things are more open... like mental health. Nurses have much more to do now... they're trained for it ... they work alongside other people like the doctor rather than separate.\"

Comments such as these represented a largely positive view of changes in community healthcare, and identify what were seen as positive aspects of the evolving role of the nurse and transformation in healthcare:

\"N12: I know that some people attending the health centre are quite baffled by who does what now until they get used to it. A lot of that relates to the extended roles we \[nurses\] have, and the specialist roles that are designed to meet patient' needs ... although I don't think they always realise that. I suppose it has become very different over the last few years\"

Patients have

Despite overwhelming interest and investigation into the topic of vaginal cuff dehiscence, one variable that has not been well described in previous studies is the patient. Studies have shown that demographic factors such as obesity, smoking, and advanced age are associated with an increased risk of wound breakdown and wound infection; however, these studies focused on open abdominal incisions \[[@CR14], [@CR15]\]. The goal of our study was to evaluate if patient-related variables may play a role in the healing of the vaginal cuff. Through performing a retrospective, case-control study, we aimed to discern if, in addition to surgical factors, specific demographic and clinical variables predispose patients to vaginal cuff dehiscence following varying modes of total hysterectomy.

Methods {#Sec2}
=======

This study was a retrospective, matched, case-control study that examined demographic, clinical, and surgical characteristics of women who experienced a vaginal cuff dehiscence following total hysterectomy compared to women who did not experience this complication. Institutional review board approval was obtained from the University of Pittsburgh prior to initiation of the study. Pertinent *Physicians' Current Procedural Terminology Coding System*, 4th edition (CPT-4) procedure codes and *International Classification of Diseases*, 9th revision diagnostic codes were used to identify all women who had a repair of a vaginal cuff dehiscence at Magee-Womens Hospital, which is a large, urban, university-based teaching hospital, between January 2000 and December 2011. Surgeons included general gynecologists, gynecologic oncologists, urogynecologists, and gynecologists trained in minimally invasive gynecologic surgery. Patients were excluded if their primary surgery (hysterectomy) was not performed at our institution.

Cases of vaginal cuff dehiscence were matched 1:5 temporally and by route of hysterectomy. Thus, for each case of dehiscence, diagnostic codes were used to identify the next five uncomplicated hysterectomies performed at Magee by the same route as the case. We controlled for route of hysterectomy as previous studies have shown an increased risk of vaginal cuff dehiscence following TLH compared to a vaginal or abdominal approach \[[@CR3]--[@CR9]\]. Five controls per case were obtained to maximize study size while appreciating that minimal statistical power is gained by increasing this ratio beyond 1:4 or 1:5 \[[@CR16]\].

Vaginal cuff dehiscence was defined as

We analyzed two additional Mendelian conditions to test generalizability of our approach: CLSD and Marfan syndrome, each with extensively-described patient phenome and well-characterized animal models. The BioVU medical phenome associated with reduced GReX of the CLSD-linked *SEC23A* gene successfully predicted 9/10 patient symptoms^[@R16]^ ([Fig. 6k](#F6){ref-type="fig"}, [Supplementary Table 6](#SD1){ref-type="supplementary-material"}). Seven of these phenotypes have been recapitulated in *sec23a*^−/−^ zebrafish model^[@R13]^ (2/3 phenotypes were not observed in zebrafish, i.e., foot deformities and hemangioma of skin, likely because of species-specific differences). For the *FBN1*-linked Marfan syndrome, characterized by cardiovascular abnormalities in patients^[@R49],[@R50]^, and mouse models^[@R51],[@R52]^, we observed 7/8 phenotypes associated to reduced GReX of *FBN1* in BioVU, and 6/8 of the phenotypes including cardiomyopathy, hernia and heart failure in published mouse models ([Fig. 6l](#F6){ref-type="fig"}, [Supplementary Table 7](#SD1){ref-type="supplementary-material"}). These tests support generalizability of the approach presented here.

Discussion {#S11}
==========

Collagen constitutes one third of the dry body mass in vertebrates and is essential for the structure and function of a wide-range of organs^[@R53],[@R54]^. In disease states such as fibrosis and wound healing, collagen is efficiently secreted to ECM to enclose the injury site. Despite such abundance and clinical importance, the exact mechanism by which procollagen moves through a cell is not well-understood. Here, for the first time, we show evidence that the Ric1-Rgp1-Rab6a module in the TGN is an essential transit point for the collagen traffic *en route* to the ECM.

Disrupted collagen secretion creates a bottleneck, resulting in multi-organ pathologies (e.g., craniofacial dysmorphology, intellectual disability). Despite the strong agreement between the common-disease phenotypes we observed in relation to *RIC1* reduced expression and the CATIFA phenotype, we acknowledge that the overlap is incomplete. This might be attributed to the limited patient numbers in BioVU or to their young age relative to some

3.3. Signal pathway effect {#mgg3969-sec-0018}
--------------------------

In order to test the impact of BMPR1A^R406L^ in greater detail, expression levels of molecular markers of chondrocytes and BMP signaling pathway effectors were examined. Western blot analysis was employed to quantify Sox9, p38, p‐p38, and p‐Smad1/5/8 in chondrocytes. The canonical pathway was first analyzed.

Results and discussion
======================

In our probes, FITC and DABCYL were linked *via* 1,4-dihydropyridine within a distance of 10 nm. Because of the FRET mechanism, DABCYL quenches the fluorescence emitted by FITC in the absence of NO. The cleavage of the C--C bond leads to the release of DABCYL and the fluorescence can be detected again (Fig. S4[†](#fn1){ref-type="fn"}). To achieve an image *in vivo*, the emission wavelength is tuned to increase the signal--noise ratio through using different fluorophores ([Scheme 2](#sch2){ref-type="fig"}).

To obtain the NO target probe, an asymmetric synthesis strategy was used in the Hanztzsch reaction. An equivalent amount of aldehyde, β-keto ester and methyl 3-aminobut-2-enoate ester were combined into an asymmetrical 1,4-dihydropyridine (compound **4**) which had only one azido moiety.^[@cit15]^ Compound **6** was designed as a linker ([Scheme 2](#sch2){ref-type="fig"}). The amino group on compound **6** is the binding site for the fluorophore, because many commercial fluorophores are designed for labeling the amino groups on peptides and proteins. The azido group would react with an yne group which was linked to a quencher. DABCYL-yne and FITC were selected to react with the linker to obtain the target probe. The reaction between **DHPFQ** (dihydropyridine--fluorophore--quencher) and NO was evaluated in phosphate buffer using a fluorospectrometer, and the reaction proceeded in a quantitative way. The C--C bond cleavage was confirmed

The data clearly show that the catalytic activity of CaO for glycerol etherification can be increased by dispersing the CaO as nanoparticles on CNF. As discussed above, we propose that at a loading of 1.7 mmol CaO, homogeneous catalysis is dominant. At higher loadings of CaO, that is, 5 mmol, heterogeneous catalysis contributes to the reaction, as a result of the presence of colloidal CaO. The efficiency and extent with which the glycerol can be charged with such colloidal catalysts is therefore key to the productivity of the system. Indeed, with 5 mmol CaO, we observe higher catalytic activity when the CaO is dispersed on CNF and dispensed from the CNF into the reaction mixture. We hypothesize that this is due to smaller colloidal particles being rapidly produced from CaO/CNF and immediately contributing to catalysis, whereas larger colloids originating from bulk CaO form over a longer time period as the reaction proceeds and thus do not immediately contribute to the catalytic activity.

CaO dissolution in glycerol involves a complex network of reactions.\[[@b23]\] The harsh temperatures and polar environment necessary for glycerol etherification ensure CaO is converted into different species during the progress of the reaction. As water is produced as a byproduct, Ca(OH)~2~ formation is unavoidable even under argon atmosphere [(1)](#m1){ref-type="disp-formula"} and CaO can react with glycerol to form calcium glyceroxides [(2)](#m2){ref-type="disp-formula"}. The active species may also be dissolved Ca^2+^ ions from [(3)](#m3){ref-type="disp-formula"} or [(4)](#m4){ref-type="disp-formula"}. The active calcium species may, finally, be present as Ca colloidal nanoparticles. The activity of the soluble Ca^2+^ species from bulk CaO or CaO/CNF is expected to be the same, whereas, the nature of the colloids formed from each source is likely to be different and to produce different activities. To verify these hypotheses we have examined our system by using light scattering techniques and conductivity measurements.

Light scattering techniques were used to characterize the Ca colloids present. Figure [10](#fig10){ref-type="fig"} summarizes the static light scattering (SLS) measurements we have performed, plotting the scattered light intensity versus *k*-squared, in which *k* is a measure for the scattering angle.\[[@b24]\] Samples

Total numbers of complications were divided by 48 to find out complication rate (2 patients died perioperatively).

These were mainly implant or fixation related complications. These were 7 patients (15%) had coccygodynia postoperatively, 6 patient had DMD and one had SMA. All patients had significant tenderness clinically over the coccyx with mild subluxation of the coccyx radiologically (Figure [1](#F1){ref-type="fig"}). All patients were treated conservatively with the use of soft cushions having round hole in the weight bearing area. Symptoms in 6 patients were decreased within six months. The remaining patient was a 13-year boy with DMD who ultimately required excision of subluxated coccyx. His symptom was relieved within six months after coccygeal excision. Two patients (4%) developed bedsore postoperatively; one was related with impingement of iliac screw with loosening which was treated with removal of screw; while another had gluteal sore which were treated with dressings and frequent position changes. Gluteal sores were considered to be due to neglected care of patients which was not due to implants or fixation related problems in the series. There were three patients (6%) who had problem due to screw head prominence on convex side; one had pain due to irritation from screw head and two had back sore due to impingement of screw head. All of them were treated with removal of at least three screws including most prominent screws and reconstructing the rod (Figure [2](#F2){ref-type="fig"}). After the revision operation all problems due to screw head resolved completely. There was one case with loosening of the screw from the distal level which was treated with reopening the site and fixing it again. There was no case with rod or screw breakage.

Analysis of the ASE by HPLC {#s0005}
---------------------------

The HPLC analysis was carried out on liquid chromatography system (Waters 2695, Milford, MA) equipped with a degasser, a quaternary pumps and photodiode array detection. A Luna C18 (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) column maintained 30 °C, and the wavelength was recorded at 280 nm. The flow was set 0.8 mL/min. The analysis of mobile phase consisted of methanol (A) and 0.1% formic acid (B) was applied to gradient elute: 0 min, 5% A; 20 min, 60% A; 24 min, 60% A.

Animals and induction of RA {#s0006}
---------------------------

The 6--8-week-old Sprague--Dawley rats (weighing 180--200 g) were purchased from the Experimental Animal Centre of Guangdong Province and housed under laboratory temperature of 19--24 °C, relative humidity 40--60%, and 12 h light/dark cycle. The rats were allowed freely access to water and basal diets. The experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Xiamen University (Ethics no. SYXK (Min) 2013-0006) and animals studies were performed according to National Institutes of Health Guidelines of United States (National Research Council of United States, 1996). RA was induced in rats through the intradermal administration of CFA (0.1 mL) at the palmar surface of the right hind paw on day 0 of the experiment (Abd El-Ghffar et al. [@CIT0001]). The incomplete Freund\'s adjuvant (IFA) group of rats received intraplantar injection of IFA (0.1 mL). CFA consisted of 1.0 mg heat-killed *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (strain H37Ra) suspended in 1 mL non-metabolizable oil, IFA contained non-metabolizable oil only. Paw swelling occurring in the right hind paw of rats was measured with vernier calliper every 7 days after RA induction. Body weight of rats were measured once a weekly after RA induction.

Rats were randomly divided into seven groups of eight animals each as follows: *Control group*: rats which received the oral vehicle only (0.1% DMSO)

Application of fluorescent dyes {#s3a}

### SYTOX Green dye; the effect of staining time and concentration {#s3a1}

The minimal effective staining concentration of SYTOX Green dye for laboratory samples of *Phormidium autumnale* was between 0.2 and 0.3 µM in 3 replicates. At this dye concentration all nucleoids in alcohol and heat-pretreated cells exhibited bright and even fluorescence in the green spectral region, which was distinctly visible with a 510--550 optical cutoff filter set ([Fig. 1a](#pone-0055283-g001){ref-type="fig"}). Further staining with higher concentrations of the dye (up to 5 µM) did not increase fluorescence intensity. This treatment, as long as it passes through the membranes of the dead cells, confirmed the applicability of SYTOX Green dye to *Phormidium* cultures, since it is also the inactive control.

The first trial was conducted by Jacobs et al, [@pone.0103431-Jacobs1] who reported that the BM in PCI and control groups was 5% and 24%, respectively; and there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups (*p* = 0.06). Strauss et al [@pone.0103431-Strauss1] and Albain et al [@pone.0103431-Albain1] also reported no significant difference in BM between the two groups (0% vs. 12%, P = 0.32 and 8% vs. 16% *p* = 0.36). Skain [@pone.0103431-Skarin1] and coworkers treated 34 patients with stage III NSCLC with chemotherapy and radiation followed by surgery. About 14% of patients received treatment with PCI developed BM compared with 26% of patients who did not receive PCI treatment.

In the most notable study by Stuschke trial [@pone.0103431-Stuschke1], 75 patients with stage IIIA/IIIB NSCLC received treatment with induction trimodality (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery). PCI was introduced after the first half of the study because of a high incidence of brain relapses. Patients treated during the second half of the study were offered PCI (30 Gy in 15 fractions). In an otherwise uniformly-treated, uniformly-staged cohort of patients, they found that there was a significant reduction in the probability of BM from 54% to 13% (*p*\<0.0001).

Analysis on BM {#s3e}
--------------

The meta-analysis on BM included 12 trials involving a total 1,718 patients including 771 patients who received PCI. All the 12 trials reported the impact of PCI on BM, concluding that PCI was associated with a significant reduction in the overall mortality of patients with NSCLC as compared with those who did not receive PCI (OR = 0.30; 95% CI: 0.21--0.43; *p*\<0.00001). There was no heterogeneity across studies (I^2^ = 0%; *p* = 0.51) ([Figure 2](#pone-0103431-g002){ref-type="fig"}), indicating that the results were valid. In addition, no publication bias was detected by Egger's test. The funnel plot is shown in [Figure 3](#pone-0103431-g003){ref-

Combining all vessels (N=124), there were no statistical differences in mean stroke volume calculated from the reference free-breathing sequence (60.3±27.3 mL), the standard breath-hold sequence (59.8±27.6 mL) and the spiral breath-hold

The linkage analysis and association analysis methods have been used to locate a plurality of Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) about maize carotenoid component traits so far. The following 4 genes related to maize carotenoid component traits have been reported:*lcyE* (GRMZM2G012966),*crtRB1* (GRMZM2G152135),*PSY1* (GRMZM2G300348), and*CRTISO* (GRMZM2G108457) \[[@B27], [@B36], [@B35]--[@B18]\]. In addition, we randomly select 100 genes, and then together with *α*-carotene (AC), *β*-carotene (BC), Lutein (LUT), Zeaxanthin (ZEA), *β*-Cryptoxanthin (Bcry), and above 4 genes composed of 109 nodes, we do the experiment 10 times, and the 10 experiments data can be seen in the supplementary file (Gene100_1.csv\~Gene100_10.csv) in Supplementary Material available online at <https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/1813494>.

As has been described in [Section 3.3](#sec3.3){ref-type="sec"}, we firstly do the discretization processing operation on the expression and phenotype data and further use the Bayesian network learning method to construct the network. We mainly use two kinds of discretization methods:*Interval* and*Quantile*. And we denote multivalue discretization result as *N*-value, like 2-value, 3-value, and so on. We compare the learning efficiency and accuracy of 10 kinds of Bayesian network learning methods (*gs*,*hc*,*iamb*,*mmpc*,*rsmax*,*tabu*,*fastiamb*,*interiamb*,*mmhc,* and TPDA) when using the discretization methods of*Interval* and*Quantile*. The whole experiment results are shown in the supplementary files (9 kinds of methods-Interval.csv, 9 kinds of methods-Quantile.csv, TPDA-Interval.csv, and TPDA-Quantile.csv).

Factors used for logistic analysis included gender, age, HBsAg status, and anti-HIV status.

Of the 513 IDUs seropositive for anti-HCV, 414 (80.7%) had detectable HCV RNA. No anti-HCV-seronegative subjects had detectable HCV RNA, regardless the status of HIV infection. We analyzed the factors related to HCV viremia among IDUs with HCV exposure ([Table 3](#pone-0094791-t003){ref-type="table"}). Age was similar between anti-HCV-seropositive IDUs with and without HCV viremia. HCV viremic subjects tended to have a higher proportion of males and higher AST and ALT ratios (*p* = 0.055, 0.08, and 0.09, respectively). Among IDUs with exposure to HCV infection, HBsAg-seropositive subjects had a significantly lower rate of HCV viremia than HBsAg-seronegative subjects did (45/78, 67.7% vs. 369/465, 79.4%, *p*\<0.001). However, the status of HCV RNA did not differ between IDUs with and without anti-HIV seropositivity. Among IDUs seropositive for both anti-HCV and anti-HIV, HCV viremic subjects tended to have higher levels of HIV RNA than those without HCV viremia (*p* = 0.09). The HCV RNA status did not correlate to the CD4 cell counts. Multivariate analysis showed that among IDUs seropositive for anti-HCV, HBsAg seropositivity was strongly negatively associated with HCV viremia, whereas anti-HIV seropositivity was significantly correlated with HCV viremia ([Table 4](#pone-0094791-t004){ref-type="table"}).

HCV RNA viral load was unrelated to CD4 cell counts among IDUs who were seropositive for both of HCV RNA and anti-HIV (5.26±1.25, 5.26±1.25, and 5.26±1.25 log IU/mL for IDUs with CD4 cell count \>500, 350--500, and \<350 cells/µL, respectively, *p* = 0.99). However, there was a significant linear correlation between HCV and HIV RNA viral loads (*R* ^2^ = 0.014, *p*\<

Microarray processing and analysis {#Sec10}
----------------------------------

Samples from 12, 18, 24 and 33 h were used for microarrays to evaluate the influence of the changes in extracellular sugar concentration on whole genome gene expression. These time points were chosen as they reflect the stage in which specific sugars were taken up. RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and purified using TRIzol® Plus RNA Purification Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The RNA concentration was calculated from the absorbance at 260 nm in a spectrophotometer (Biochrom Libra S22). The RNA quality was analyzed with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer using a RNA6000 LabChip kit (Agilent Technology). Microarray hybridization was performed at GenomeScan (Leiden, The Netherlands). Microarray data was analyzed using Affymetrix Expression Console software v1.4.1.46 with the normalized values in linear scale. The probe intensities were normalized for background by the robust multiarray average (RMA) method which makes use of only the perfect match probes. Gene expression values were calculated with the medianpolish summary method from the PM probes. Genome scale PCA analysis with gene expression of the four different time points was generated using FactoMineR^[@CR34]^ package from Rcomander v.2.1--7 in R 3.1.2.^[@CR35]^.

Discovery of sugar transporters {#Sec11}
-------------------------------

A total of 71 known fungal transporter sequences were collected from Transporter classification database^[@CR36]^ (TCDB, <http://www.tcdb.org/>) and by manual literature search. The sugar transporter domain (PF00083) profile extracted from PFAM database (<http://pfam.xfam.org/family/pf00083>) was used to search against the combined sequence files of *A*. *niger* proteome and known transporters with the 'hmmsearch' of the HMMER tool^[@CR37]^. The hmmsearch score ≥238 was chosen as a cutoff to define the sugar transporter candidates since it was the lowest score observed among the search results of all the known transporters. Each transporter candidate was Blast searched against the collected sequences of known fungal transporters. With the threshold of Blast e-value \< 1E-6 and identity percent \>30%, the best Blast hit was used to annotate the candidate transporters.

Using a Zn deficiency-promoted rat ESCC model with prominent miR-31 overexpression ([@r11]) and a cancer-associated inflammatory gene signature ([@r8]), we investigated the effects of LNA-mediated antimiR-31 delivery, or constitutive knockout of miR-31, on NMBA-induced ESCC development in ZD rats. We found that in vivo LNA-antimiR-31 delivery moderately suppressed ESCC development, whereas genetic miR-31 knockout completely protected ZD:miR-31^−/−^ rats from ESCC development. In parallel, we examined the molecular consequences of miR-31 silencing in ESCC suppression by analyzing gene expression and metabolomics profiles. Because genome instability is an important "hallmark" of cancer development, we were also interested, during this "omics" study, to include whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of esophageal tissue samples from NMBA-treated rat cohorts: ESCC-bearing Zn-deficient wild-type (WT) rats, Zn-sufficient (ZS) WT rats with undetectable tumors, and tumor-free ZD:miR-31^−/−^ rats.

AntimiR-31 Delivery Inhibits ESCC Development in Zn-Deficient Rats. {#s2}
-------------------------------------------------------------------

To determine if in vivo antimiR-31 delivery silences miR-31 and suppresses the development of ESCC, we performed a 20-wk anticancer study in the ZD rat ESCC model with miR-31 up-regulation ([@r11]) and a cancer-associated inflammatory gene signature ([@r8]). We used an LNA-mediated rno-miR-31a-5p inhibitor probe (designated antimiR) to inhibit esophageal miR-31 expression and an LNA-negative-control-A probe (designated CTRL-A) as a control oligo ([@r10]). As depicted in [Fig. 1*A*](#fig01){ref-type="fig"} (see treatment details in [*Materials and Methods*](#s12){ref-type="sec"}), 4-wk-old rats were randomized into four Zn-deficient cohorts (ZD:antimiR/20-wk, ZD:antimiR/5-wk, ZD:CTRL-A, ZD:CTRL) and one Zn-sufficient group (ZS:CTRL).

IL‐1 family cytokines, which include the recently described IL‐36α, IL‐36β and IL‐36γ proteins, are among the first cytokines produced in response to infection or injury and play key roles in the initiation of inflammation as a consequence [1](#feb412406-bib-0001){ref-type="ref"}, [2](#feb412406-bib-0002){ref-type="ref"}, [3](#feb412406-bib-0003){ref-type="ref"}, [4](#feb412406-bib-0004){ref-type="ref"}.

For the Or and Gr families of roughly similar size in *D. pseudoobscura*., 18 and 8 proteins were precisely correctly annotated in FlyBase, respectively ([Appendices 1](#app01){ref-type="app"} and [2](#app02){ref-type="app"}), as part of the automated annotation effort ([@bibr32]). Existing annotations for 23 Ors and 24 Grs required some modification, commonly minor N- or C-terminal extensions to reach appropriate start and stop codons, but sometimes involving missed exons or unspliced open in-frame introns. In a few cases a single gene was annotated in a region that encodes multiple genes or transcripts, e.g. GA12528 represents the five transcripts that are hypothesized to be produced from the alternatively-spliced Gr28b locus. Eleven genes in each family were represented by GA placeholders in the *D. pseudoobscura* genome browser but no annotation was available for them, while 20 Ors and 16 Grs had no GA identifier associated with them. Some of the latter are pseudogenes and some were truncated by ends of contigs so they could not be annotated, and the remainder are instances of genes without *D. melanogaster* orthologs and hence might more easily have been missed by the orthology-based automated annotation process. The automated annotation rate was nevertheless rather low at just over 50%, perhaps because of the high divergences of some of these orthologous pairs. All of these gene models were communicated to FlyBase in 2005, and the encoded proteins are available in a supplementary file (chemoreceptor_proteins.txt).

Comparisons with the *D. pseudoobscura* and *D. yakuba* genes also allowed improvement of several *D. melanogaster* gene models, most of which were incorporated in FlyBase with publication of Robertson et al. ([@bibr35]). Additional subsequent changes included recognition that the N-termini of DmGr21a and 63a are probably shorter than earlier predicted (see also [@bibr33]), while DmOr65b/c each likely have a short N-terminal extension to the existing annotation. These changes have been made in FlyBase. In addition, the version of DmOr98b in the sequenced genome is a pseudogene, see below.

Chemical synthesis of NPs follows the bottom-up approach. This process mainly involves the use of water-soluble cations as a precursor to trigger their reduction to metal monomers, and the process is called nucleation. The growth of particles where it assembled cluster of reduced metal atom automatically stop the growth controlled by reducing agent/capping. The particles reached a certain size which is stable thermally. Nanomaterials are synthesized by the interaction of atoms and smaller molecules. Various chemical synthesis techniques include the sol--gel process, pyrolysis, CVD, microemulsion, hydrothermal, polyol synthesis, and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. Chemical preparation involves synthesis of metal NPs in a chemical solution, and various chemical reactions and chemical compositions are used for these purposes. For instance, the chemical reduction of metal ions inside reversed micelles in a nonpolar solvent is the most commonly employed method for the preparation of metal nanoparticles (MNPs) \[[@B36-nanomaterials-09-01719]\]. For instance, first, a metal slat dissolved in water is confined in the reversed micelles and is reduced into MNPs by chemical reduction. Size control of the particles is important and is regulated by volume of reversed micelles and ratio of water. Several points need to be considered for synthesis of PtNPs such as the appropriate shape and size and the appropriate selection of solvent, temperature, and reducing/capping agent. The method should also avoid aggregation. The advantage of chemical methods is cost effective, high versatility in surface chemistry, easy functionalization, high yield, size controlled, thermally stable, and reduced dispersity. Disadvantages of chemical methods include low purity and the use of toxic chemicals and organic solvents, which can be hazardous to human beings and the environment.

Chemical methods are important, established methods of NP synthesis. In the early 1920s, Adam et al. \[[@B37-nanomaterials-09-01719]\] prepared bulk type PtO~2~ using a fusion method at 450 °C. Next, numerous methods were used to modify the material into NPs. NP production is efficient and low cost but requires toxic chemicals. Several studies have reported chemical synthesis of PtNPs \[[@B38-nanomaterials-09-01719],[@B39-nanomaterials-09-01719],[@B40-nanomaterials-09-01719],[@B41-nanomaterials-09-01719],[@B42-nanomaterials-09-01719],[@B43-nanomaterials-09-01719],[@B44-nanomaterials-09-01719]\].

The authors report an 'audit' of healthcare professionals looking after patients who self-harm^[@bibr1-2059513118767994]^ and report lack of awareness and adherence to NICE guidelines and some negative attitudes from a minority of staff. That is not entirely surprising and probably mirrors attitudes across all areas of healthcare. In their survey the vast majority of staff had very positive, compassionate and supportive attitudes to such patients. This should be highlighted and applauded. The numbers in the 'audit' are relatively small particularly with regards to surgeons, so generalisations from the data should be interpreted with caution.

Timing of surgical intervention in burn patients depends on a number of factors that relate to the patient, co-morbidities, wound characteristics and healing potential. In major burns it is time critical; in smaller injuries it is not so critical. Care must be taken to assess and manage any co-morbidity to optimise patients for surgery and successful outcome. Mental health issues are no different in this respect to cardio-respiratory disease, diabetes, hypertension etc. Comprehensive assessment of these problems often leads to delays in surgical treatment. Patients with psychosocial issues leading to self-harm must be offered the same opportunity of assessment prior to surgical intervention as those with other co-morbidities.

The NICE guidelines are obviously excellent and give advice in general on best practice. They are not burn specific. They were published fourteen years ago in 2004 and although checked, they have not been revised. This may be a reason that many staff are unaware of them. They do state that patients should be offered the same care as other patients with injury but this should mean careful assessment of all co-morbidities including mental health ones. There is significant emphasis on risk assessment in the guidelines which has not really been explored or emphasised by the study either in terms of attitudes or its impact on treatment. The NICE guidelines are a little contradictory in themselves as they also state that treatment of small wounds can be modified from standard care to suit patient need.

The authors do not really distinguish the patient populations involved: for instance Isolated instances versus patients who repeatedly self-harm. The management of patients who repeatedly self-harm is most difficult and complex particularly in terms of risk assessment and reduction. I don't think anyone knows the best way of managing such injuries to minimise risk of recurrence and the evidence for current best practice in burn patients is non-existent. Further research efforts should focus on this area. Amongst many question, it

*Enduring memories* is both an autobiography and an evocation, or more correctly a celebration, of a largely vanished world. John Walker-Smith, an accomplished paediatric gastroenterologist, charts his career from his early education in a privileged and Anglophile public school in Sydney, Australia, through his years of medical training, his decision to become a medical scientist, and the long career of research and specialist practice that followed in Sydney and London. This is a candid and sincere portrait of a life devoted to improving the health of children with serious and debilitating conditions in a field that, if already in existence in the 1950s, had yet to be consolidated. Walker-Smith has been intimately involved in the development and advancement of this field and his story is a valuable one for historians of paediatric medicine.

Walker-Smith\'s book also sheds rich light on two key episodes in the history of modern British medicine. First, he describes in detail the (ultimately unsuccessful) attempts made by the Conservative government of the early 1990s to close the ancient institution of St Bartholomew\'s Hospital, with regrettable repercussions for the morale of the hospital staff (not least for Walker-Smith himself) and many of their patients. Second, he explores the ongoing controversy concerning the claim that there might be a link between the MMR jab and the putative increase in the incidence of children suffering from autism. Walker-Smith, who was involved in the research and writing of the paper that caused such massive press interest, describes some of the disparities between the media representation of the argument and the claims actually made by Wakefield *et al*. He expresses regret that the press was so rapidly involved in the issue, but defends the integrity of Wakefield and his colleagues as scientists and insists that it remains entirely valid to explore the possibility of a link between the MMR jab and a small number of cases where gastroenterological disorders are associated with autistic-like symptoms. It is an engaging discussion of a too often polarized issue.

This book is not just a survey of a life in medicine. Walker-Smith devotes large sections to broader reflections: on the relations between Britain and Australia, the role and significance of the monarchy, on tradition, poetry, literature and art. Walker-Smith is an ardent monarchist and a believer in the desirability of close Anglo-Australian ties. To a growing extent (as the author appreciates), such views put him out of step with the

Cardiac arrest is the third leading cause of coma, second only to trauma and drug overdose. Over the past two decades several publications have reported the outcome of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for inhospital cardiac arrest. Only a sparse amount of data is available concerning the initial CPR success rates and long-term survival in adult ICUs from Germany. Initial CPR success rates range from 16.8% to 44% and long-term survival to discharge from hospital ranges from 3.1% to 16.5%. Although the initial successful resuscitation rate in ICU patients may be high, long-term and hospital discharge rates have been reported to be unsatisfactory.

Objective
=========

To evaluate the demographic characteristics of patients who suffered cardiac arrest in our ICUs as well as to identify those factors influencing outcome after resuscitation following cardiac arrest.

Methods
=======

We reviewed the records of all patients who underwent CPR in our ICUs at the Georg-August University Hospital Göettingen, Germany from January 1999 to December 2003. The GISI database was used to search for all admissions to these ICUs, and records of patients who had CPR during their stay in the ICUs were retrieved and studied.

Results
=======

During the study period, 169 patients underwent CPR. Eighty of the 169 patients with confirmed inhospital arrest survived to hospital discharge, giving a survival to hospital discharge rate of 47.3%. The initial monitored rhythm recorded at the time of arrest was asystole in 99 (58.6%) patients. Ventricular tachycardia/ fibrillation was recorded in 59 (34.9%) and pulseless electrical activity in seven (4.1%) patients. Forty-six (54.8% of the survivors), 31 (36.9%) and five (6.0%) patients with initial recorded asystole, VT/VF and PEA rhythms, respectively, survived to hospital discharge. Of the 80 patients that survived to hospital discharge 75 (93.8%) achieved good cerebral recovery (CPC 1 or CPC 2) and were alert and fully oriented on discharge; four patients (5.0%) were severely disabled (CPC 3), while one (1.2%) remained unconscious and was reported dead 5 days after discharge to another local hospital. Illness severity as assessed by the SAPS II score on admission was 38.8 ± 16.0. None of our patients with SAPS II score \>40 24 hours after CPR survived to be discharged from the ICU

Further complications of bipolar hemiarthroplasty include intra-operative metaphyseal fractures reported in 10% of cases in a series of 273 patients with displaced femoral neck fractures, depending on extension of fracture dislocation \[[@B51]\]. The dislocation rate was reported to be 1.5% in a large series of 1934 hips \[[@B52]\], half of which redislocate after reduction. Other authors reported 4% dislocation rate \[[@B53],[@B54]\]. Additional problems associated with bipolar hemiarthroplasty are migration of the bipolar head, as well as stem migration \[[@B55]\], failure of the polyethylene inlay \[[@B56]\], and component disassembly \[[@B57]-[@B61]\]. Heterotopic ossification is more frequent in cemented than in uncemented bipolar hemiarthroplasty \[[@B62]\]. However, pain relief and function are better in patients with bipolar hemiarthroplasty -regardless of cemented or uncemented- compared to unipolar arthroplasty \[[@B63]\]. In order not to miss anterior narrowing of the joint line, axial views must be done as cross-table.

Both, unipolar and bipolar hemiarthroplasty increase biomechanical stresses on the acetabular bone and that way cause migration of the head with consecutive destruction of the acetabulum, as demonstrated in a finite element model \[[@B64]\]. Although some reports describe little acetabular erosion \[[@B65]-[@B67]\], several studies demonstrated significant acetabular wear in up to 67% of cases, resulting in an average time to failure of 38 months \[[@B8],[@B68],[@B69]\]. This wear was quantified with an average rate of 0.7 mm per year \[[@B68]\]. These prostheses are therefore only recommended in old patients with limited life expectancy. A recent review of the current evidence for internal fixation versus hemiarthroplasty versus primary total hip arthroplasty for displaced femoral neck fractures showed no difference in mortality, postoperative pain, function, or quality of life for either of the devices. For hemiarthroplasty, the data suggest minimal differences in outcome between the prosthesis types \[[@B70]\]. Summing up the findings from the literature, hemiarthroplasty are preferentially performed in older patients with limited life expectancy and low functional demands.

Total Hip Arthroplasty
----------------------

In most western European countries and in the U.S., arthroplasty is the mainstay of surgical treatment of intracapsular femoral neck fractures in patients older than 60 to 65 years \[[@B71]-[@

Gardens
-------

The two garden locations in China were the Sun Yat Sen Arboretum and the Jiangsu Forestry Institute ([Table 2](#plw087-T2){ref-type="table"}). The former had been a grassy area mowed multiple times per year before the garden was set up. The latter was a 1-year fallow rice field. The two garden locations in Hawaii were the Hawaii Agricultural Research Corporation in Maunawili (on Oahu) and the Malamaki Agricultural Experiment Station (on Hawaii). The former was a 1-year fallow sugar cane field and the latter was an exotic grass dominated fallow field previously used for growing tropical fruit (more than 5 years before). The three gardens in Texas were at the University of Houston Coastal Center (La Marque, TX), Katy Prairie Conservancy (Katy, TX) and Armand Bayou Nature Center (Pasadena, TX). Each was native dominated grassland that had been mowed annually. The background vegetation was not managed in any garden during the experiment so *T. sebifera* plants competed with the background vegetation.

Experiment design
-----------------

The experiment was a factorial design with three geographic venues (Hawaii, Texas, China), seven gardens nested within venue, two population origins (continental US vs. China), 14 populations nested in origin and an insect suppression treatment. In each of the seven gardens we planted seedlings from every

She was loaded with aspirin and ticagrelol and she underwent diagnostic angiogram on day 4 post hospital admission.

At the beginning of the procedure, the left main stem was engaged, however dampened pressure was noted and a test shot showed left main stem occlusion with dissection (Fig. [1](#rjy121F1){ref-type="fig"}).

![Test shot showing left-main-stem occlusion with dissection (National-Heart-Lung and Blood-Institute class F).](rjy121f01){#rjy121F1}

The patient acutely became hemodynamically unstable and suffered a cardiac arrest. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started and the patient was intubated. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved with inotropes, vasopressors and intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation. Following ROSC, angiographic wires were passed into the coronaries. However, the operator was unable to wire the true lumen of the circumflex artery (Fig. [2](#rjy121F2){ref-type="fig"}).

![Wires left into the coronaries during transfer. LAD and intermediate: true lumen successfully wired. Cx: unable to wire true lumen.](rjy121f02){#rjy121F2}

At this point, decision was made to transfer the patient to our cardiothoracic unit for emergency coronary artery bypass graft. The patient was transferred to our unit with the angiographic wires left on purpose into the coronaries.

After arrival to our cardiothoracic unit, the patient was immediately taken to the operating room. Transoesaphageal echocardiography demonstrated a poor-left-ventricular-function (ejection fraction 29%) with anterior, antero-septal and antero-lateral regional wall motion abnormalities. Sternotomy was performed and cardiopulmonary bypass established with mild hypothermia (34 C°). Antegrade cardioplegia was administered and asystole was achieved. On visual inspection, the coronaries appeared extensively dissected therefore the arteriotomies were elongated proximally and distally until the true lumen could be identified. Subsequently two saphenous vein grafts were grafted onto the LAD and OM1, respectively. In order to identify the true lumen, the arteriotomy was extended past the dissection point in case of the OM1 and guided by the wire in case of the LAD. Proximal anastom

Simple reaction simulation
--------------------------

It is difficult to distinguish the SR strategy from true entrainment because the SR simulated birds maintained a consistent phase relationship with the stimuli over the course of the trials ([Fig. 3](#f3){ref-type="fig"}).

However, the phase-matching rates of the real and simulated birds differed under the 450--1,200-ms-IOI conditions, although the pecks could phase-match with the stimulus onset under the 1,500-ms- and 1,800-ms-IOI conditions ([Table 1](#t1){ref-type="table"}). As the IOI elongated, the hit period became longer and both stimulus onset and ERT were located in a relatively narrow range. Therefore, the circular distribution logically concentrated on the period including both ERT and stimulus onset. Nevertheless, the responses of one real bird remained phase-matched with stimulus onset but not with ERT under the 1,500-ms-IOI condition, showing that the rate at which real and simulated birds phase-matched with ERT differed.

Moreover, NMA was extremely rare in the simulated birds, and the simulated subjects had far fewer failures than did the real birds (*P* \< 0.0125).

Taken together, none of the four possible models provided a sufficient explanation for the real birds\' behaviour. The budgerigars\' pecks maintained a consistent phase relationship with the stimuli based on anticipation, and this pecking pattern was not the outcome of simple reactions. Consequently, the original idea, that the budgerigars anticipated the stimuli and entrained to the metronome, survived.

Tapping to auditory stimuli
---------------------------

In the main part of our study, we presented the budgerigars with auditory and visual cues simultaneously to facilitate the association between the LED key and the reward as per the operant conditioning protocol[@b10][@b11][@b12]. However, it is important to test entrainment to auditory stimuli alone because this is the modality of interest in the vocal learning and rhythmic synchronization hypothesis[@b5].

To this end, isochronous tapping to auditory stimuli alone was tested in three female budgerigars. Tapping was measured as they were alternately exposed to IOIs of 600 ms and 1,500 ms. The experiment was repeated twice (see Methods section).

The birds quickly learned to perform the task without special training. Their pecks were phase matched with

We designed a screen to identify genes involved in phospholipid anabolism and catabolism that might have an impact on ageing. For this purpose, we performed chronological ageing experiments with a subset of yeast strains deleted for non-essential genes known to be involved in phospholipid metabolism. At day 3 of the chronological ageing experiment, we measured the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by assessing the ROS-driven oxidation of non-fluorescent dihydroethidium (DHE) to fluorescent ethidium by cytofluorometry. This screening procedure led to the identification of three genes whose deletion caused an ageing-dependent raise in ROS generation ([Figure 1a](#fig1){ref-type="fig"}): *isc1*Δ, *psd1*Δ and *psd2*Δ. *ISC1* encodes an inositol phosphosphingolipid phospholipase, which produces ceramide. Interestingly, deletion of *ISC1* has been previously reported to decrease chronological lifespan,^[@bib30]^ thus validating our screen results. *PSD1* and *PSD2* encode phosphatidylserine decarboxylases, which similarly convert PS to PE, and are located in distinct cellular organelles (see Introduction). As these two enzymes have not been associated with yeast aging, we decided to focus our study on these enzymes and their products.

We confirmed the premature ageing phenotype of the *PSD1* and *PSD2* knock outs by clonogenic survival plating ([Figure 1b](#fig1){ref-type="fig"}) and assessed the PE- and PC-abundance at day 3 of ageing by HPLC-assisted analyses of lipid extracts ([Figure 1c](#fig1){ref-type="fig"}). *PSD1* deletion had a more pronounced inhibitor effect on both PE synthesis and yeast ageing. This is consistent with a previous report underscoring that, at least in standard culture conditions, Psd1 is the predominant phosphatidylserine decarboxylase, the abrogation of which disturbs homeostasis of PE and a number of phospholipid species including PS and PI which can be overcome by the administration of ethanolamine.^[@bib31]^

As previous works have also shown that *PSD1* deletion has a strong impact on mitochondrial function,^[@bib32],\ [@bib33]^ we examined to which extent the reduction in survival upon chronological ageing might be a consequence of general mitochondrial dysfunction or specific to the deletion of PSD activity. We thus generated *psd1

Swine were randomly allocated to either of two groups: Standard resuscitation or standard resuscitation (Shock group) and inhaled CO (CO group). Randomization was done in blocks of 10 animals. Of the 10 animals, one was allocated blindly to receiving sham surgery, which consisted of cannulation as previously described, without hemorrhage. Given that blinding was not possible, allocation to either group was disclosed to the investigators performing the study only after 55 minutes into the hypotensive period in order to avoid any bias during the surgical or hemorrhage phases. Animals allocated to CO received a pre-mixed gas containing 250 parts per million (ppm) in 40% oxygen after 60 minutes into the shock period delivered through the anesthesia circuit.

### Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity {#sec013}

MPO activity in the lungs in the murine moderate shock model was determined four hours after resuscitation as described by Anderson et al\[[@pone.0135032.ref015]\]. Lungs were excised, washed in saline, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were thawed and homogenized in 20 mM/L potassium phosphate (pH 7.4). Samples were centrifuged at 15,000*g* for 30 min at 4°C. The pellet was then resuspended in 50 mM/L potassium phosphate (pH 6.0) containing 0.5% hesadecyltrimethylammonium bromide. Samples were sonicated and then centrifuged 15,000*g* for 10 min at 4°C. Supernatant (5 mircoliters) was then added to 196 microliters of reaction buffer containing 530 nM/L *O*-dianisidine and 150 nM/L H~2~O~2~ in 50 mM/L potassium phosphate (pH 6.0). Light absorbance at 490 and 620 nm was read and compared with standards. Protein content in the samples was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay. Results were corrected per microgram of protein.

### Murine serum cytokine, ALT measurements, and arterial blood gas measurements {#sec014}

Serum levels of the cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpha were measured in the murine moderate shock model four hours after resuscitation using enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay (ELISA; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was determined using an iSTAT Analyzer (Abbott, Princeton, NJ). Arterial blood gases were obtained from the femoral

Kunnen we dat laatste nog wel voldoende ondersteunen, nu we gedwongen worden om de \'fysieke contacten\' zoveel mogelijk te beperken? Hoe gaan de mensen bewegen als sportscholen en sportverenigingen hun deuren gesloten moeten houden uit angst voor verspreiding van het virus?

Samenwerken {#Sec1}
===========

Maar een nog groter probleem is of we voldoende \'gezonde\' zorgprofessionals hebben om de kwetsbaren te helpen. Ook zonder de dreiging van het coronavirus is het al een hele klus om die grote groep mensen die kwetsbaar is van de juiste zorg te voorzien. Zo is in Apeldoorn het Zorgpad ondervoeding bij kwetsbare ouderen ontwikkeld door professionals uit het sociale en het medische domein om ondervoeding sneller te herkennen en te behandelen. Juist de samenwerking is belangrijk: gebruikmaken van elkaars kwaliteiten en elkaar aanvullen.

Initiatief tot samenwerking zien we ook als het om *TPO De Praktijk* gaat. De beroepsverenigingen V&VN pvk/poh en de Nederlandse vereniging voor praktijk- ondersteuners (NVvPO) zijn de laatste jaren steeds hechter gaan samenwerken. Hierover vertellen voorzitters Gertrud van Vulpen en Petra Portengen in het interview op pagina 26.

V&VN pvk/poh, NVvPO en NHG gaan samen één tijdschrift voor praktijkondersteuning uitgeven. Dit nummer van *TPO de Praktijk* zal het laatste zijn in deze vorm. Zelf heb ik besloten te stoppen met mijn werk als redactielid. Ik blijf werkzaam als praktijkverpleegk

Thyroid cancer represents 10--15% of all head and neck neoplasms in the dog, and 90% of thyroid tumors detected clinically are carcinomas.[1](#jvim12330-bib-0001){ref-type="ref"}, [2](#jvim12330-bib-0002){ref-type="ref"} Thyroid carcinomas can be classified as follicular cell thyroid carcinomas (FTCs), which arise from follicular thyroid cells, and medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTCs), which arise from the parafollicular C cells and have a neuroendocrine origin. Although thyroidectomy is the preferred treatment modality, invasive nonresectable thyroid tumors are common in dogs, and in up to 38% of dogs, the tumor has already metastasized by the time of diagnosis.[3](#jvim12330-bib-0003){ref-type="ref"}, [4](#jvim12330-bib-0004){ref-type="ref"} Furthermore, almost 50% of dogs undergoing thyroidectomy experience recurrence or metastatic disease within 2 years of surgery.[4](#jvim12330-bib-0004){ref-type="ref"} Therefore, it is important to investigate new treatment modalities for the large number of dogs with inoperable tumors or metastatic disease.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the main stimulator of angiogenesis in the thyroid gland, and VEGF overexpression has been found in human thyroid cancer.[5](#jvim12330-bib-0005){ref-type="ref"} VEGF is secreted by cancer cells and binds to VEGF tyrosine kinase receptors on the surface of endothelial cells and thyrocytes. In people, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor‐2 (VEGFR‐2) inhibition with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is the most effective new therapeutic strategy developed to date in the treatment of advanced thyroid cancer.[6](#jvim12330-bib-0006){ref-type="ref"} VEGF, angiogenesis, and VEGF‐induced pathway activation may play important roles in the progression of

**PURPOSE:** To compare operative times for specific portions of deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap harvest as well as perforator selection in cases where preoperative CTA imaging had been reviewed by the harvesting surgeon preoperatively vs. not reviewed.

**METHODS:** This is a prospective pilot study of two patient groups undergoing breast reconstruction using DIEP flaps. We utilize a two-surgeon approach for all DIEP flaps and for the experimental group the harvesting surgeon was blinded to the results of the preoperative CTA, whereas in the control group the harvesting surgeon had assessed the CTA preoperatively. Patients were randomized to the blinded vs. non-blinded group based on surgical day. Operative times were recorded for initial perforator identification, perforator selection, and total flap harvest time and were compared between groups. The choices of perforators (medial, intermediate, or lateral) were also compared between groups. Within the blinded group, perforator selection by the blinded harvesting surgeon was compared to the pre-operative perforator selection by the non-blinded, non-harvesting surgeon based on CTA imaging.

**RESULTS:** From June-November, 2018, 13 DIEP flaps were performed where the surgeon was blinded to the preoperative CTA results, and 49 flaps were not blinded. The mean time to first perforator identification was longer in the blinded vs. the non-blinded group \[29.2 minutes (SD=8.2) blinded group, 15.1 minutes (SD=6.7) non-blinded, p\<0.0001\]. Time to perforator decision-making was also longer in the blinded vs. the non-blinded group \[25.3 minutes (SD=9.11) blinded, 5.75 minutes (SD=11.2) non-blinded, p\<0.0001\]. Mean total harvest time was significantly longer in the blinded vs. the non-blinded group \[114.6 min (SD=32.5) blinded, 72.6 min (SD=23.7) non-blinded, p\<0.0001\]. Medial row perforators were used in 53.4% (7/13) of flaps in the blinded group, and 42.8% (21/49) of flaps in the non-blinded group, p=.479. Intermediate row perforators were used in 15.4% (2/13) of flaps in the

DISCUSSION {#s3}
==========

Since the discovery of Brd4 as an epigenetic regulator, a number of studies have characterized target genes and molecular pathways that are regulated by it \[[@R11]--[@R16], [@R19]\]. Recent studies have suggested a model in which Brd4 acts as a scaffold to recruit multiple regulatory proteins such as the hematopoietic transcription factor CEBPβ through direct protein-protein interactions \[[@R16], [@R19], [@R21]--[@R23]\]. The recent finding that NPMc+ and MLL-fusion AML cell lines and primary leukemic cells have sustained activation of autophagy and that autophagy is reduced with Brd4 inhibition \[[@R10]\] suggested that Brd4 is a regulator of autophagy. The present study provides more direct evidence that Brd4 in conjunction with CEBPβ plays an important role in the transcriptional regulation of autophagy genes in certain AML cells. Inhibition of Brd4 function with both well-validated inhibitors and inducible Brd4 shRNAs reduced the expression of Atg3, Atg7, and CEBPβ, each of which plays an important role in the induction of autophagy. Genome-wide occupancy studies of Brd4 using Brd4-ChIP-seq demonstrated that Brd4 is located at the promoter and enhancer regions of CEBPβ and is present in conjunction with CEBPβ at several other autophagy-associated genes, suggesting an integral role for CEBPβ in autophagy. This result is further supported by the marked reduction of Atg3 and Atg7 expression that follows depletion of CEBPβ. These data, together with those obtained by Roe et al \[[@R19]\], indicate that Brd4 acts as an upstream regulator responsible for the recruitment of CEBPβ to core genes enabling autophagy in select cell types.

Somatic mutations in KEAP1 and NRF2 occur in a variety of cancer types and are important mediators of aberrant anti-oxidant responses \[[@R39], [@R40]\]; however, no such mutations have been reported to date in human leukemia cells (The Cancer Genome Atlas, TCGA, database) \[[@R41]--[@R43]\]. Our study supports a model in which Brd4 increases the expression of Keap1, resulting in down-regulation of the Nrf2-antioxidant pathway and increases in both ROS levels and autophagy in NPMc+ AML cells \[[@R36], [@R37]\]. Conversely, a reduction in Keap1 expression by Brd4 inhibition or CRISPR-cas 9 excision

Case history
------------

The patient is an Italian male, currently aged 21. Only one mutant allele of *SLC7A7*gene was identified in the patient: this mutation, p.M50K (c.149T \> A), is located in the TM domain I and causes the substitution of a highly conserved amino acid. The p.M50K mutation was inherited from the father \[[@B20]\]. Although several groups have tried to identify the mutation inherited by the mother, these attempts have been thus far unsuccessful.

The clinical history of the patient was already described in two papers \[[@B21],[@B22]\]. Briefly, in the eighth month of life the baby was diagnosed as affected by LPI and, at the age of 15, a PAP was diagnosed based on Computed Tomography (CT) scan of a crazy paving pattern and of a mild restrictive ventilatory impairment. The patient was treated by whole lung lavage (WLL) according to the current standard of care. At a control chest CT scan performed 9 months after the WLL, the crazy paving pattern was almost totally resolved, but the lung density was slightly, diffusely increased with respect to normal lungs. After 4 years, the patient was newly admitted for fever and hypoxemia, and the lung CT scan revealed the relapse of PAP (Figure [2A](#F2){ref-type="fig"}). On January 2009 he underwent a WLL which resulted in an immediate improvement. The benefit this time was transient, and on March 2009 he was newly admitted to our Intensive Care Unit (ICU) because of severe respiratory failure. The third WLL, performed on March 2009, was complicated by an acute alveolar haemorrhage with acute anaemia, and the patient was treated with non-invasive ventilation and red blood cell transfusion. The persistence of respiratory failure suggested patient refractoriness to WLL and

Introduction {#sec1}
============

The development of sustainable, efficient, and selective syntheses is one of the fundamental research goals in modern chemistry. In this context, it is important to perform reactions under catalytic conditions and to replace precious metal catalysts by earth-abundant nonprecious metal catalysts.^[@ref1]^ As far as chemical processes are concerned, hydrogenations and acceptorless alcohol dehydrogenation, sometimes in conjunction with hydrogen autotransfer reactions, are becoming important areas of research.^[@ref2],[@ref3]^ In particular, iron and manganese constitute promising candidates, as these are among the most abundant metals in the earth's crust, are inexpensive, and exhibit a low environmental impact. While iron hydrogenation and dehydrogenation catalysts have been the subject of intense investigation over the past decade,^[@ref4]−[@ref8]^ low-valent Mn(I) complexes just recently appeared as new but very powerful players in this field.^[@ref9]−[@ref12]^ Concerning iron, the development of novel catalysts was largely inspired by concepts known from its well-established ruthenium congeners, which are particularly effective for hydrogenative reductions and oxidations of polar substrates. After the first reports on Fe(II)-catalyzed hydrogenations, we even stated "Iron, the New Ruthenium".^[@ref13]^ However, in light of recent achievements accomplished by isoelectronic Mn(I) catalysts, the question arises whether this statement is still valid or has to be reconsidered, since these novel systems appear to show even more similarities to traditional ruthenium than iron chemistry (diagonal relationship Mn--Ru). Nevertheless, the development of base metal catalysts that can even compete with their "noble" analogues remains a challenging task since specific properties of first-row transition metals (e.g., oxidation states, spin states, ionic radii, redox potentials) are fundamentally different and new strategies and concepts have to be developed in order to circumvent unfavorable phenomena in this context. Consequently, the synthesis of isolated and structurally well-defined complexes combined with a fundamental understanding of reaction mechanisms appears to be a primary objective for the rational development of novel catalytic systems.^[@ref14],[@ref15]^

In this Account, we describe well-defined Fe(II)- and Mn(I)-based catalysts featuring PNP pincer ligands based on 2,6-diaminopyridine that have been developed by our group ([Figure [1](#fig1){ref-type="fig"}](#fig1){ref-type="fig"}).^[@ref16]

For missense variants, the online tools Polymorphism Phenotyping v2 (PolyPhen-2) \[[@CR18]\], Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) \[[@CR19]\], and Mutation Taster \[[@CR20]\] were utilized to predict the pathogenicity of each variant. Multiple sequence alignment and conservative analysis were performed by ClustalX software (version 2.1; Conway Institute, University College Dublin, Dublin, Republic of Ireland). The amino acid sequences of human neurofibromin (NP_000258.1) and that of 11 different vertebrates were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) protein database (FASTA format). For frame shift variants (small deletions and single nucleotide duplication), DNAMAN (version 5.2.2; Lynnon Biosoft, San Ramon, CA, USA) was used to predict how the reading frame was interrupted and to calculate the number of nucleotides before a premature stop codon.

Restriction fragment length polymorphism {#Sec8}
----------------------------------------

Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was used, together with nested PCR and restriction endonuclease, to discriminate between genotypes of patients and that of unaffected individuals in Families 1--3 with larger pedigrees. In addition to the primers used for Sanger sequencing, nested PCR primers were designed to enhance the specificity of small DNA fragments or to introduce a mismatch nucleotide to create a new restriction site (Additional file [1](#MOESM1){ref-type="media"}: Table S1). Sequence differences between wild-type and mutant alleles resulted in the gain or loss of a restriction site that led to size differences between amplicons of different alleles after the restriction endonuclease reaction. The restriction endonucleases (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) *Taq*^α^ I (restriction site: T\|CGA), *Alu* I (restriction site: AG\|CT), and *Sac* II (restriction site: CCGC\|GG) were applied to Families 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) using an 8% neutral polyacrylamide gel was then performed to separate DNA fragments of different sizes. Electrophoresis conditions included 1 × TBE as electrophoresis buffer and a constant voltage of 350 V for 3--5 h. Silver staining was used for the final step of the chromogenic reaction.

The title molecule (I), (Fig. 1), except the hydroxyl and methyl H atoms, close to planar (r.m.s deviation 0.017 Å). The values of the geometric parameters in (I) are comparable to those of some similar structures (Khan *et al.*, 2009).

In the solid-state, the molecules are linked *via* intermolecular O---H···O hydrogen bonds (Table 1, Fig. 2). The crystal structure is further stabilized by an intermolecular C--H···π interactions between the methylene H atom of ethenol substituent and the pyridine ring of an adjacent molecule, with a C10--H10A···*Cg*1^ii^ separation of 2.75 Å (Table 1, *Cg*1 is the centroid of N1/C1--C3/C8/C9 pyridine ring; symmetry code: (ii) *x*, *y* + 1, *z*). In addition, the packing mode results in stabilizing π-π stacking interactions \[*Cg*1···*Cg*2^ii^ = 3.661 (2) Å, where *Cg*1 and *Cg*2 are the centroids of the N1/C1--C3/C8/C9 and C4--C9 rings\].

Experimental {#experimental}
============

2-Chloro-8-methylquinoline-3-carbaldehyde (206 mg, 1 mmol), sodium borohydride (38 mg, 1 mmol) and catalytic amount of montmorillonite K-10 were taken in an open vessel and the resulting mixture was irradiating at 500 W for 4 min. Ethylacetate was poured into the reaction mixture and filtered off. The filtrated after removal of solvent ethy lacetate was subjected to column chromatography packed with silica and ethyl acetate/petroleum ether was used as the eluant. Colourless plates of (I) were grown by solvent evaporation from a solution of the compound in chloroform.

H atoms were positioned geometrically, with C---H = 0.93- 0.97 Å

It is written in the classical text that when *Vasti Dravya* is sent into the colon, in left lateral position, it may reach the *Grahani*.\[[@ref1]\] The pH of small intestine varies between 7.5 and 8. The pH in the colon varies from 5.5 to 7. It is important to measure the pH of *Vasti Dravya* which is sent into the colon every time because it can alter the pH of gut easily.

The mucosal lining of colon is permeable to the ionized form of a weak acid or weak base. The weakly acidic and basic drugs exist in two forms:

An unionized component predominantly lipid soluble which is absorbed rapidlyAn ionized and often water-soluble component which is absorbed poorly.

Acidic drugs are rapidly absorbed from the stomach. Basic drugs are not absorbed until they reach the alkaline medium of the small intestine. The alkaline environment in which the major component of the drug exists in an unionized form, facilitates their absorption.\[[@ref2]\]

Chemoreceptor cells in the gut are responsible for the pH regulation and substrate concentration. The pH, viscosity, and enzyme content of the chyme are all optimized for rapid enzymatic breakdown. Once the chyme leaves the initial segment of duodenum, no further adjustment can be done. But if *Vasti Dravya* with desirable pH is sent into the gut, it may create a favorable environment for enzymatic activity in the distal segments of intestine.

Studies *in vitro* and vivo have already shown that consumption of carbohydrate substrate and H~2~ production by human colonic bacteria are directly related to luminal pH,\[[@ref3]\] which can be easily altered by the pH of *Vasti Dravya* sent into the colon.

It has been observed that low pH of *Vasti Dravya* has some corrosive action on the mucosa, these symptoms are nothing but the complication of *Vasti* like cutting pain in anal region (*Parikartika*), and anal discharge due to inflammation (*Parisrava*) already mentioned in the Charakasamhita.\[[@ref4]\]

Temperature {#sec2-4}
-----------

Temperature is a measure of hotness or coldness. Regarding *Vasti*, some people advocate that the temperature of *Vasti Dravya* should be same as the rectal temperature; some say that it should be 1°C less than the rectal temperature. Rectal temperature is more accurate than

**Methods:** 250 nasopharyngeal aspirates and sputum samples were collected from clinically diagnosed cases on pneumonia. The samples were inoculated on sheep blood agar. The organism grown was identified with gram staining, hemolysis on sheep blood agar, bile solubility, and sensitivity to optochin. Demographic and clinical details such as age, sex, type of infection, underlying disease, and response to treatment, for all 250 patients were noted. Antibiotic testing was done for pencillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, cotrimoxazole and results interpreted as per Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.

**Results:** Of the 250 specimens, *S. pneumoniae* was isolated in 10 samples. 1 isolate was resistant to penicillin, 2 isolates were penicillin intermediate resistant and rest were sensitive to penicillin. 1 strain was MDR. 30% resistance was seen with tetracycline and cotrimoxazole and 20% strains were erythromycin resistant. All patients responded to antimicrobial therapy and none of the patients died

**Conclusion:** Increasing prevalence and emergence of antibiotic resistant among *S. pneumoniae* in the community set up is a matter of great concern and large scale studies are required to estimate prevalence, antibiotic resistance and serotypes of the isolates so that national guidelines can be formulated regarding prevention and treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia.

Processes
---------

Under *Processes* the main sub-themes were procedures for conducting assessment, appeal processes, review processes and reflection on the strengths and weaknesses of their systems. Importantly, most organisations reported that their assessment processes and examiners were being continually reviewed. Information about the assessment process, including sample questions, marking criteria etc. were provided to the candidate prior to the assessment process. Written assessments were largely undertaken off-shore, that is, not in Australia. Caution was advised when running examinations off-shore as it was a complex task to have the correct candidate at the correct site sitting the correct examination and receiving the correct results. The organisational difficulty was increased with larger numbers of candidates.

Post-assessment issues including candidate feedback and appeals were also canvassed. Most organisations provided feedback to candidates who failed an element(s) of the assessment process and this assisted in clarifying areas in which the candidate needs to improve and also minimise appeals, ensuring the process is fair and transparent \[[@B8]\]. Organisations were understandably keen on minimising appeals, and in most cases appeals were only available to the candidate if an examination process issue was identified. These steps to minimise appeals would also have an impact on making the assessment defensible from a legal standpoint. Although this was not articulated by participants in the current study, previous research has indicated this is a concern for such organisations \[[@B8]\], and minimised by the use of valid and reliable assessment strategies. When asked to reflect on their processes, organisations identified numerous strengths and weaknesses, and these organisations also presented planned or potential changes to their assessment processes.

Examining
---------

Within the theme *Examining*, there were two sub-themes related to marking (including processes for those who fail) and assessors (selection and training). Marking was undertaken using checklists \[[@B36]\], ensuring that candidates performed required elements, however there was little discussion of the use of global or holistic assessments. The use of holistic assessments is becoming widely reported in the literature as a valid and reliable assessment outcome \[[@B37]-[@B40]\], although it appears that this has yet to make its way into the assessments undertaken by the organisations. The use of global assessments has been demonstrated to improve the reliability and validity of an assessment, particularly where communication skills are assessed \[[@B41],[@B42]\].

Most organisations spent large amounts of time and money on their examiners, in terms of training, recruitment and payments to assess. Examiners were typically selected

The skin is the natural site of entry for infective promastigotes transmitted by sand flies obtaining a blood meal. Therefore, interaction with the dermal immune system at the initial stage of infection is likely to be important to disease outcome. Several studies have been conducted to characterise the *in situ* immune response against *Leishmania*. TNF-α, IL-lα, IL-10 and TGF-β were significantly increased in chronic compared to early lesions, suggesting a role of these cytokines in the immunopathogenesis of chronic disease ([@B26]). Moreover, both IL-10 and IL-12 mRNAs were co-expressed in most lesions of individuals with active LCL ([@B27]).

In a recent study, *in situ* gene expression of cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, IFN-γ) and chemokines (MCP-1, MIP-1α) was examined in biopsies of *L. (L.) mexicana* active lesions. Additionally, MST biopsies were taken from subjects with healed lesions and those with asymptomatic infection. IL-12 and MCP-1 in the absence of IFN-γ gene expression were predominant in subjects with healed lesions and asymptomatic infections, suggesting that these molecules could play a role in early infection and skin-level outcomes ([@B42]).

The frequency of CD8+ IFN-g+ cells after soluble *Leishmania* antigen stimulation was higher for asymptomatically infected individuals than for CL patients. The frequency of infected monocytes in cells from individuals with asymptomatic infection was lower than in cells from CL subjects ([@B8]).

DISCUSSION
==========

First, asymptomatic infection is the most common outcome after *Leishmania* spp. inoculation by infected *Lutzomya* in New World endemic areas of ACL. The epidemiological studies reviewed support the hypothesis that asymptomatic subjects with a positive MST after inoculation by *Leishmania-*infected sand flies are resistant and capable of controlling the infection without evidence of tissue damage. Nevertheless, the mechanisms involved in controlling the infection and responsible for the absence of clinical signs and symptoms remain to be identified. This knowledge is indeed relevant for better understanding the immune mechanisms that could be useful for vaccine development.

Epidemiological studies evaluating the incidence and prevalence of ACL have mostly focused on passive reporting systems. Commonly, only defined cases of ACL (*i.e.*, patients with active cutaneous lesions) are recorded. Therefore, it is important to note that ACL infection includes not only active

For construction of the targeting vector for *pbhrf* disruption (*PbHRF*; plasmid provided by P. Smooker and K. Taylor, RMIT University, Bundoora, Australia), DNA fragments corresponding to the 5′ untranslated (UTR) and 3′UTR regions of the *pbhrf* gene were amplified by PCR using *P. berghei* NK65 genomic DNA (gDNA) as a template. These primers ([Table S2](http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20151976/DC1){#supp5}) were tailed with restriction sites for ApaI, PstI, KpnI, and EcoRI to facilitate cloning into either side of the *hDHFR* cassette ([@bib8]) in pUC18 backbone. The targeting construct was integrated into the *pbhrf* gene locus by double crossover recombination, resulting in the disruption of *pbhrf* and conferring WR99210 or pyrimethamine resistance. Transfection into a GFP-*Pb*NK65 parasite strain and selection of recombinant parasite clones were performed as previously described ([@bib9]). In brief, after overnight culture (37°C with 10% O~2~ and 5% CO~2~ at 90 rpm) of the blood of infected animals, mature schizonts were purified using a Nycodenz gradient and collected at room temperature. The electroporation mix was composed of 10^7^--10^8^ merozoites resuspended in 50 µl and 100 µl of human T cell Nucleofector solution (Amaxa) and 5 µl DNA (containing 5 µg of digested DNA in water). Parasites were electroporated using the U33 program of the Nucleofector electroporator (Amaxa) and immediately resuspended in PBS and injected intravenously into 3-wk-old female SW mice. Recipient mice were treated with 0.07 mg/ml pyrimethamine in drinking water or with 6 mg/kg WR99210 by subcutaneous injections, starting 24 h after electroporation. At day 6 after electroporation, the emerging parasite population was collected, gDNA was extracted, and genomic integration of the *hDHFR* cassette (within the *pbhrf* locus of GFP-*Pb*NK65 transfectants) was confirmed using specific PCR primers: (a) Apa-5′UTR *Pb*HRF-F and EcoRI-3

The sperm MMP was evaluated using the JC-1 fluorescent dye (Molecular Probes Inc.) as previously described \[[@CR27]\]. Aliquots of 200 μL of diluted frozen spermatozoa (2 \~ 4 × 10^6^ spermatozoa/mL) were mixed with 1 μL of 100 μM JC-1 (final concentration, 0.5 μM) and 1 μL of 200 μM PI (final concentration, 2 μM) to exclude dead spermatozoa. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 5 % CO~2~ and then was analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentage of spermatozoa with viable and high MMP (J~agg~+/PI−) and the Mean J~agg~ fluorescence intensity (J~agg~ MFI) per viable sperm were evaluated. To investigate the population of spermatozoa with high MMP of viable spermatozoa, the ratio of J~agg~ + to viable spermatozoa (%) was calculated as follows: (J~agg~+/PI− \[%\] ÷ PI− \[%\]) × 100.

Flow cytometric analysis {#Sec12}
------------------------

All flow cytometry analyses were performed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San José, CA, USA) equipped with a 15 mW air-cooled 488 nm argon-ion laser and Cell Quest Pro software (Becton Dickinson). A total of 10,000 individual sperm-sized events were selected based on forward and side scatter and were collected at a flow rate of \< 400 events/s. FL1 (PNA-Alexa Fluor 488), FL2 (J~agg~) and FL3 (PI) signals were detected through 530 nm, 585 nm and \> 670 nm band pass filter, respectively.

Statistical analysis {#Sec13}
--------------------

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software (version 17.0 for Windows; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The Shapiro-Wilk test was utilized for normality analysis of the parameters. To compare the effect following OptiPrep™ concentrations, one-way repeated-measures (RM) analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used in data with a normal distribution and Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons was used for *post hoc* analysis. Otherwise, the non-parametric Friedman test and *post-hoc* analysis with Wilcoxon

At the onset of symptoms, a conservative multidisciplinary treatment approach consisting of medical and physical therapy should precede surgery \[[@B7]\]. Thereafter, the decision about the surgical or conservative management of herniated lumbar discs has to be based on the results of clinical and neurological examinations; current guidelines keep the results of imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) secondary \[[@B8]\]. The most common indication for surgical management of LDH is failure to improve with conservative management \[[@B9]\]. Most clinicians advocate waiting 4 to 8 weeks from the onset of symptoms before considering surgery. However, in cases with cauda equina syndrome, progressive motor deficit, or in patients whose pain remains intolerable despite adequate medical therapy, surgery is indicated before this time course has elapsed \[[@B10],[@B11]\]. Many authors, however, have revealed a poor prognosis for patients operated on after prolonged conservative treatment \[[@B12],[@B13]\]. Consequently, for obtaining better outcomes for LDH, it would be helpful to predict the possibility that an individual patient may benefit fully from conservative management, or on the contrary, may be a candidate for surgery, at an early stage after the onset of symptoms.

MRI is frequently used in the diagnostic evaluation of LDH. Nonetheless, there is still a paucity of data regarding the prognostic value of MRI findings in LDH and its predictive value for patients who may need surgery for LDH; therefore, it is not routinely used as a criterion for surgery. Komori et al. \[[@B12]\] suggested that the type of herniation (based on a 3 type classification presented by the authors) is correlated with outcome and is a major prognostic factor, while others have reported cases with lumbar disc extrusion who had fully recovered with medical therapy, both clinically and on imaging \[[@B14],[@B15]\]. Others have suggested that discs with a high signal on T2 weighted images were more prone to regression in size \[[@B16]\]. However, these studies are few and the results are not conclusive.

To the best of our knowledge, no study has examined the relationship between clinical and lumbosacral MRI abnormalities and the likelihood of being deemed a surgical candidate among symptomatic patients with LDH. Therefore, we designed a prospective study to investigate patients with untreated LBP with or without radicular leg pain to assess the predictive value of demographic, clinical or imaging findings in those who finally would meet the classic current criteria for surgery.

Four types of nanopore array distributions are discussed here, as shown in Fig. [1](#F1){ref-type="fig"}. The pore sides of the nanonets have numbers of dangling bonds. Thus, Si--O--Si, Si--OH, as well as Si--H are selected as passivation bonds. Hydrogen atoms are usually used for passivation in constructing models of nanoscale. However, it is known that Si--H bond is of poor stabilization in the air. It will be replaced by Si--O bond, which is a stable state on the silicon surface. Si--O passivation is also easy to achieve by exposing the sample in the air \[[@B14],[@B15]\], electrochemical oxidation \[[@B16]\], or thermal oxidation \[[@B17]\] and has already been introduced into the microelectronics devices. It has also been widely studied in order to improve the luminescence property of porous silicon \[[@B18]\]. For the 100 nanonets, most of the silicon atoms on the pore walls have two dangling bonds. We use oxygen-bridge to link neighboring silicon atoms in sides and hydrogen atoms to passivate silicon atoms in corners (Fig. [1](#F1){ref-type="fig"}a, b). For the 110 models, each silicon atom on the pore walls has only one dangling bond. Therefore, hydroxyl is used for passivation and the Si atoms in the corners are also passivated by H in order to reduce the internal stress (Fig. [1](#F1){ref-type="fig"}c, d). The special points in the reciprocal space of the nanonets and the paths in our calculation are shown in Fig. [1](#F1){ref-type="fig"}e. The coordinate axes in the reciprocal space are established corresponding to the axes of the real space shown in Fig. [1](#F1){ref-type="fig"}a--d.

Splenomegaly was observed in all models, particularly in the PPMF model (Fig.[3](#fig03){ref-type="fig"}B). It was mainly because of erythroid hyperplasia in the PV/PPMF models and of myeloid hyperplasia in the PTMF model. Fedratinib sharply decreased spleen weight to almost normal values in all models. In the PV model, spleen cell composition almost returned to normal values with a large decrease in erythroblasts (Ter-119^+^/CD71^+^) cells and an increase in the percentages of B and T cells. The same tendency was observed in the PPMF model but the level of erythroblasts still remained elevated. In very sharp contrast, the spleen cell composition in the PTMF model was unchanged by the treatment.

Fedratinib had a profound effect on megakaryocyte (MK) hyperplasia except in the PTMF model. In the PV model, Fedratinib induced a potent decrease in MK density in the spleen but not in BM (Fig. S1A and B). Preliminary results also showed a reduction after treatment of the high ploidy observed in JAK2^V617F^ KI mice (mean ploidy from 20 ± 2N before to 14 ± 1N after treatment, WT mice 16 ± 2N, *n* = 4). In the PPMF model, Fedratinib induced a decrease in MK density and size in spleen. In BM, only MK size was reduced (Fig. S1C). Total transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, a MK-derived cytokine involved in fibrosis, tended to decrease in BM and spleen (Fig. S2). In the PTMF model, no effect in spleen and BM MK was observed, probably because of the extreme MK hyperplasia observed in the TPO^high^ model (Fig. S1A and B).

At the progenitor cell level, methylcellulose cultures revealed a decrease in the total high numbers of spleen CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-E in all models (*P* \< 0.05) after Fedratinib treatment. In the BM, there was a decrease in the total CFU-E number only for the PV model and an increase in the total BFU-E number for the PPMF model, all other total number of BM progenitor cells showing no variation during treatment. In the PPMF model, flow cytometry analysis

ERAS AND OPEN HEPATECTOMY
=========================

There is increasing interest and published experience describing the application of ERAS principles to hepatectomy.[@ref10],[@ref19],[@ref20] van Dam et al.[@ref21] first reported the outcomes for ERAS in open liver resection. The study concluded that there was a two-day reduction in the median hospital stay (*p*\<0.001) for patients who underwent the ERAS pathway.

ERAS programs in liver surgery can reduce complication rates by 30-60% compared to traditional post-operative care, and without an increase in re-admission rate. Several clinical trials have demonstrated the safety of ERAS combined with open hepatectomy.[@ref8],[@ref22],[@ref23]

Furthermore, mean duration of hospital stay and time to functional recovery can be reduced by 2.3 days[@ref9],[@ref10],[@ref24][@ref25][@ref26][@ref27]-[@ref28] and 2.5 days respectively.[@ref29] A meta-analysis on ERAS with open hepatectomy has also reported significant reductions in post-operative complications and hospital stay.[@ref27]

ERAS AND MIS HEPATECTOMY
========================

There is increasing use of minimal invasive surgical (MIS) approach to hepatectomy. MIS hepatectomy has many advantages over traditional open hepatectomy, including reduced intra-operative blood loss, hospital stay and earlier return to functional activities,[@ref30][@ref31]-[@ref32] and has become standard practice for minor liver resections, especially left lateral sectionectomies.[@ref33]

The additional contribution of ERAS with MIS hepatectomy remains unclear.[@ref21] The combination of MIS hepatectomy with ERAS programs might have additional synergistic benefits for patients compared with MIS approach alone.[@ref34],[@ref35] Laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) combined with ERAS has been shown to reduce median hospital stay by two days compared to standard LLR alone.[@ref36]

ERAS AND MIS HEPATECTOMY: PUBLISHED LITERATURE
==============================================

There are several published studies on ERAS and MIS hepatectomy ([Tables 2](#T2){ref-type="table"}, [3](#T3){ref-type="table"}). Stoot et al.[@ref36] reported the outcomes of a pilot series of laparoscopic liver resections with and without ERAS.

The above questionnaires were given to the subjects before and after intervention, the filling details were taught and secrecy of the information was guaranteed. Yoga classes were held twice a week (each session, 1 h\[[@ref22][@ref25]\] for 8 weeks). Hatha Yoga techniques were selected as intervention for the present study through literature review and consultation with the experts. Hatha Yoga includes breathing exercises (pranayama), physical movements (asana), and deep relaxation (shavasana). The classes were conducted by the researcher under supervision of a Yoga expert. In Yoga classes, the first 10 min were devoted to deep breathing relaxation techniques. Then, professional Yoga techniques (asana) were exercised for 40 min and the last 10 min were spent on the same relaxation exercises.

The collected data were analyzed by descriptive inferential (independent *t* test) statistical tests through SPSS18.

R[ESULTS]{.smallcaps} {#sec1-3}
=====================

From a total of 36 nurses attending Yoga classes, 34 finalized the study and filled out the questionnaires. Inferential tests showed that all the nurses attending in this study had a BS degree. The mean age of nurses was 33.53 (7.69) with range of 24-52 years and mean monthly hours of their work was 2.4.18 (29) h. Most of the subjects were married (44.1%) and staff nurses (82.4%). The highest frequency was for those casual staff (61.8%)\[[Table 1](#T1){ref-type="table"}\]. The mean score of problem focus strategy was 13.68 before intervention, whereas it reached 16.53 after that and independent *t* test showed a significant difference (*P* \< 0.001). With regard to emotion focus, the mean score before intervention was 13.50, whereas it changed to 12.97 after intervention and the independent t test showed a significant difference (P = 0.014). The mean scores for state-trait focus changed from 11.97 before intervention to 14.68 after and the independent t test showed a significant difference (*P* \< 0.001). It can be concluded that 8-week Yoga exercises could significantly affect stress coping strategies\[[Table 2](#T2){ref-type="table"}\].

Multivariate analysis {#sec2-3}
---------------------

The lower molars dimensions were selected in all the multivariate functions to discriminate the sex of subjects ranging from 68.1% (70.5% males, 64.3% females) to 75% (75% males, 75% females) whereas only cervical and linear dimensions of upper molars could estimate sex of 67.2% subjects. The upper crown and diagonal dimensions of studied molars did not contribute anything toward sex determination in multivariate DFA \[[Table 5](#T5){ref-type="table"}\]. The regression analysis results show that lower cervical dimensions classified sex to highest percentage of 72.2% (84.1% males, 53.6% females), and in case of upper molars, both cervical and linear dimensions classified sex of 67.2% molars. All the functions accurately classified more than 65% subjects to their original sex category from multivariate regression analysis \[[Table 6](#T6){ref-type="table"}\]. Thus, we can conclude that upper molars dimensions (cervical and linear) could identify sex of 67.2% subjects from both multivariate analyses, i.e., DFA and LRA. The lower molar dimensions were found comparatively more accurate and reliable enough for sex determination of any unknown molar tooth from equations derived in the present study. The multivariate analysis of pooled data (without discriminating between lower and upper molars) was also run for both discriminant and regression analyses. MDCV, BL, BLCV, and MLDB were selected as the most sexually dimorphic variables. Linear dimensions have been selected more frequently than diagonal dimensions in more than half functions; thus, former gave better classification rates than the later. The results of multivariate discrimination function of both upper and lower molars metrics revealed that the equations so-formulated identified sex of more than 70% individuals. In the case of regression analysis, the function using all linear and diagonal measurements assigned the sex to the highest percentage of subjects (i.e., 69.4% subjects).

Discussion {#sec1-4}
==========

A literature review of information published in English between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2012, was conducted to identify the clinical endpoints used in malignant melanoma, NSCLC, and RCC clinical trials and their frequency of use. These tumors were selected as they are the main types in which novel immunotherapies have been evaluated to date. Only endpoints directly referring to clinically measured outcomes were included, and not point estimates such as hazard ratio (HR) which are derived from data analysis. Two literature sources were searched: published systematic reviews of clinical trials and HTA reports. Additionally, documents identified during the first search that also provided metrics (in conjunction with cure definitions) were included in the results of this second search. Full details of the methodology and limitations are included in Supplementary Material 2. Again, this literature search strategy was designed pragmatically to prioritize the identification of key information in a very large literature base.

The literature search identified 2,951 documents, of which 146 were included in the final sample, comprising 92 clinical trial review papers and 54 HTA documents. The endpoints identified in the clinical trial reviews and HTA reports are shown in Tables [1](#tab1){ref-type="table"} and [2](#tab2){ref-type="table"}, respectively. Overall, the most common endpoints reported were response rate, disease-free survival (DFS) or progression-free survival (PFS), median OS, recurrence rate, and quality of life. The endpoints used to assess clinical response were the most heterogeneous and, within this category, response rate or objective response rate (ORR) was the most frequently used. These endpoints were also used across all evaluated tumor types. Endpoints related to disease progression were relatively homogeneous, with PFS, DFS, recurrence-free survival, and time to progression (TTP) being the most frequently used. In the survival category, endpoints were fairly homogeneous with median OS used frequently across the tumor types. OS, in the majority of cases, median OS specifically, was the only "survival" endpoint reported for malignant melanoma and RCC, accounting for 82% and 83% of the "survival" endpoints reported in clinical trial review papers and HTA reports, respectively. Endpoints relating to recurrence and/or relapse were not found in HTA reports but were included in clinical trial review papers. In the review papers, local or overall recurrence rates were the most commonly used.

When comparing the endpoints reported for the different tumor types, there were only minor differences ([Figure 2](#fig2

Discussion
==========

Despite improvements in the outcomes of radical resection of CRC and 5-year cumulative survival rates of 69.9% for all stages and 85.2--88.4% for stages I--II \[[@b1-amjcaserep-16-149]\], 17.3% of operated patients (906 of 5230) develop recurrent diseases \[[@b2-amjcaserep-16-149]\]. In most cases of recurrence (83.2%), the lesion is detected within 3 years after the radical operation. Detection of the first recurrence more than 5 years after surgery is very rare (3.6% of cases) \[[@b3-amjcaserep-16-149]\]. If it is possible to completely resect the recurrent tumor, patient survival is expected to be longer \[[@b4-amjcaserep-16-149]\].

Detection of recurrent lesions usually involves serum tumor marker level measurement, ultrasonography, CT, and MRI. In addition, the efficacy of FDG-PET has been confirmed \[[@b5-amjcaserep-16-149]--[@b8-amjcaserep-16-149]\]. Luboldt et al. reported that FDG-PET/CT provided promising accuracy for colorectal mass detection and that, in all carcinomas and adenomas with high-grade dysplasia, the SUV~max~ was ≥5 \[[@b9-amjcaserep-16-149]\]. A review by Visioni and Kim stated that the sensitivity and specificity of PET-CT in detecting CRC recurrence were 89--95% and 83--92%, respectively \[[@b10-amjcaserep-16-149]\]. One of the studies evaluated in that review \[[@b11-amjcaserep-16-149]\] reported a positive predictive value of 96.4% and a negative predictive value of 76.9% for the diagnosis of CRC recurrence by PET-CT.

Although the reported lesion, in our case, was suspected by CT to be a recurrent tumor from the colon cancer operated on 5 years ago and was diagnosed clinically by FDG-PET/CT as recurrent disease, with a high SUV, the resected lesion was finally diagnosed as benign fibrous tissue on histopathological analysis. FDG-PET/CT is a sensitive tool for detecting malignancy, but FDG uptake is not tumor-specific. Gollub et al. reported that PET-CT did not detect 5 of 37 colon adenocarcinomas, 1 of which was found to be mucinous on histological analysis

Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH) is a rare form of autoimmune hemolytic anemia mediated by a biphasic IgG autoantibody that triggers complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis. The name PCH is derived from its classic presentation with episodic hemoglobinuria, typically following exposure to cold temperature. First described by Donath and Landsteiner 1904 \[[@CR1]-[@CR4]\], PCH was once considered to be a chronic condition in adults due to its association with syphilis. Today, most cases of PCH are acute, self-limited disorders that occur following transient viral or bacterial infections in children or adults \[[@CR1]-[@CR5]\]. Post-infectious PCH is usually caused by a polyclonal IgG autoantibody with specificity for the erythrocyte P antigen \[[@CR1]-[@CR3],[@CR5]-[@CR11]\]. PCH also can present in association with lymphoproliferative disorders, in which case the pathogenic autoantibody tends to be a monoclonal IgG \[[@CR9],[@CR10]\]. To our knowledge, PCH associated with pregnancy has not been described previously. Herein, we report a case of a young, healthy female who presented during early pregnancy with acute intravascular hemolysis due to PCH.

Case presentation {#Sec2}
=================

An 18 year old female patient presented with acute symptoms of abdominal and flank pain, nausea, dark red urine, fevers and chills. One month prior to presentation, she had experienced a few days of rhinorrhea and headaches, suggestive of a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Upon presentation, she was found to be pregnant by serum hCG and ultrasound, with an estimated gestational age of 6 weeks. Laboratory evaluation showed hemoglobin 11.2 g/dL, haptoglobin \<20 mg/dL, total bilirubin 6.8 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0.7 mg/dL, lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) 735 U/L, and absolute reticulocyte count 49.3 K/μL. Urine analysis demonstrated 3+ blood and the microscopic examination was negative for red blood cells. A direct antiglobulin test was positive for anti-C3d and negative for IgG. The cold agglutinin titer was negative (\<2). Donath Landsteiner antibody testing was performed using a blood sample that was immediately immersed into an insulated container filled with water at 37°C, and directly delivered to the testing laboratory.

Patient A was a 50-year-old woman presenting with a 4-month history of depressed mood, diminished concentration, decreased motivation, and insomnia. She was not on any medications, had undergone menopause at 45 years of age, reported no history of medical comorbidities, and had not previously experienced manic or depressive episodes. She had no family history of mental illness. In addition, her thyroid gland was functioning normally (TSH: 2.68 µU/mL, FT4: 1.14 ng/dL, FT3: 2.6 pg/mL). She was then diagnosed with major depressive disorder in accordance with criteria outlined in the fifth edition of the *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders* (DSM-5),[@b35-ndt-14-2099] following which she was prescribed escitalopram at a dosage of 10 mg/day. After 14 days, she exhibited mild improvement in her depressive symptoms. However, as this effect was insufficient, the dose was increased to 20 mg/day. After an additional 14 days, the patient developed hypomania lasting more than 4 days, exhibiting arrogant and aggressive behavior, inflated self-esteem, uncharacteristic talkative behavior and overspending, as well as a decreased need for sleep. Symptoms of hypomania improved as escitalopram was tapered off. The patient is currently stable on a treatment regimen consisting of lithium at 800 mg/day, and she has exhibited no hypomanic symptoms since the cessation of escitalopram treatment.

Patient B
=========

Patient B was a 66-year-old woman presenting with a 2-month history of depressed mood, anxiety, inhibition of thoughts, decreased motivation, loss of appetite, and general malaise. She had previously been diagnosed with hypertension and rheumatoid arthritis, although her physical condition had been stable for several years due to treatment with antihypertensive and immunosuppressive agents, respectively. She underwent menopause at 48 years of age, had no past history of manic or depressive episodes, and no family history of bipolar disorder. Her thyroid gland was functioning normally (TSH: 1.90 µU/mL, FT4 1.26 ng/dL, FT3: 2.3 pg/mL). She was then diagnosed with major depressive disorder in accordance with criteria outlined in the DSM-5, following which she was prescribed escitalopram at a dosage of 10 mg/day. After 14 days, she exhibited mild improvement in her

Similarly, a one-way ANOVA analysis for pollen tube length showed that the seven cultivars had different pollen tube lengths (*P* ≤ .05) ranging from 0.22 to 1.15 mm (Fig. [3](#Fig3){ref-type="fig"}). The pollen tube lengths of Red Globe were the longest (1.15 mm). Pollen tube lengths of five of the cultivars (0.85 mm for Flame Seedless, 0.64 mm for Tangwei and Xuefeng, 0.22 mm for Yanshan) were significantly different (*P* ≤ .05). There were no significant differences (*P* ≤ .05) between the pollen tube lengths of Beichun (0.97 ± 0.06 mm), Shuangyou (0.88 ± 0.06 mm), and Red Globe (1.15 ± 0.06 mm). Kelen and Demirtas ([@CR17]) also drew similar conclusions, namely that pollen viability, germinability, and tube growth differed significantly among grape cultivars. These authors also studied the fertilization biology of eight grape cultivars including berry diameter and length, berry weight, seed numbers, and seed weight. In the future, we will investigate the fertilization biology of our seven crosses and investigate further the relationship between pollen production and fruit set. Our research examined the pollen viability of seven seedless cultivars. Of the wild Chinese *Vitis* species or cultivars, Beichun and Shuangyou are considered to be the best male parents for hybridization with seedless *V*. *vinifera* grape cultivars.Figure 3.Pollen tube lengths (millimeters ± SE after 24 h) for seven cultivars cultured on pollen medium. Significant (*P* ≤ .05) differences in tube lengths were not observed between Red Globe, Beichun, and Shuangyou. The other five cultivars were significantly different.

Sampling time. {#d30e1109}
--------------

Sampling time (the embryo rescue time) had a significant effect on embryo rescue efficiency. Embryos are hard to save if sampling time is too early, but they will abort if sampling time is too late (Bin et al. [@CR2]). Therefore, for seedless grape breeding using embryo-rescue techniques, it is critical to determine the optimal sampling time for each cultivar under investigation. This should be

To investigate this, the authors next explored correlating a variety of neural signals to subjective ratings. Specifically, they employed a set of analyses which considered three basic EEG phenomenological measures relevant to their paradigm -- steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP), pre-stimulus alpha power, and event related potentials (ERPs). The SSVEP has often been linked to attention and task-engagement (Muller et al., [@B4]) and the RSVP paradigm enables the authors to investigate modulations in SSVEP amplitude as they might reflect attentional waxing and waning toward the task. Surprisingly, neither amplitudes of the SSVEP nor early trial-averaged ERPs (i.e., the P1--N1 complex) varied significantly as a function of the subjects' rating of their attentional state. Late ERPs that were differentially evoked by targets, namely the P300, were however modulated as a function of attentional state and confidence, specifically for target trials. One interesting possibility is that the P300 amplitude reflects the perceptual evidence available for a decision, with variability in attention and confidence reflecting the variability in perceptual representation of the target. In combination with the fact that the authors found no association between early perceptual EEG responses and attentional state rating, the P300 amplitude correlations suggest that effects of attentional state may occur at the decision level rather than the perceptual level. This is in agreement with previous findings (Ratcliff et al., [@B5]) which for a different perceptual decision making task, found temporally late, but not early, EEG components were informative for improving the estimation of the drift rate in a drift-diffusion model.

Next the authors investigated pre-stimulus alpha power and found that for trials in which subjects reported lowered attentional state, pre-stimulus alpha was higher. Particularly interesting was the time course of this relationship. Using a window based classification procedure, the authors found attentional state ratings smoothed over 7 min were most significantly correlated with pre-stimulus alpha. This suggests that the waxing and waning of attentional state occurs over relatively long periods in the task, which as the authors state, has practical implications for optimal information delivery.

There are a few differences between what Macdonald et al. report in terms of pre-stimulus alpha and previous studies featuring simple visual detection tasks. Most significantly is that Macdonald et al. do not see substantial differences between pre-stimulus alpha and correct vs. incorrect detection of targets,

**Regulation of p53 activity.** p53 is degraded by Mdm2, which is induced by p53. ATR~p~ inhibits Mdm2 activity by phosphorylating it at Ser407[@b30] and disrupts the p53-Mdm2 interaction by phosphorylating p53 at Ser15, thereby leading to p53 accumulation[@b29]. Based on its posttranslational modifications, nuclear p53 is divided into three forms: p53 (unphosphorylated), p53~p~ (phosphorylated), and p53~pac~ (phosphorylated and acetylated). Four forms of Mdm2 are defined here: Mdm2~c~ (cytoplasmic unphosphorylated), Mdm2~cp~ (cytoplasmic phosphorylated), Mdm2~n~ (nuclear unphosphorylated), and Mdm2~np~ (nuclear phosphorylated). For simplicity, we assume that only Mdm2~cp~ can enter the nucleus[@b31]. Mdm2~np~ cannot act as an E3 ubiquitin ligase[@b30].

The coactivator p300 is required for the full transcriptional activity of p53 and HIF-1. Their competition for binding to p300 is characterized by the Michaelis-Menten kinetics with competitive inhibition (see Eqs. 1--2 and 10--11). The acetylation rate of p53~p~ (or HIF-1α) is an increasing function of its own concentration, and is a decreasing function of the level of HIF-1α (or p53~p~). On the other hand, p53, p53~p~ and HIF-1α are targeted for degradation by Mdm2. The involved competition is also characterized by the Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Eqs. 1, 9 and 10). Notably, Mdm2-mediated degradation of p53~pac~ is neglected since its dual modifications block their interaction. p53-induced expression of target genes, including *mdm2* and *puma*, is all characterized by the Hill function, and the Hill coefficient is set to 4 given the p53 tetramer acts as a transcription factor.

Mdm2~c~ can be phosphorylated by Akt, promoting its nuclear entry[@b32]. Akt is activated via phosphorylation by PIP3 (phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate), which is dephosphorylated by PTEN (phosphatase and tensin

SVO. {#s19}
----

A measure of SVO was administered in wave 2. We used the SVO slider, a six-item measure where participants are asked to state their preference of monetary allocations between themselves and another anonymous person ([@r9]). The final score was the inverse tangent of the ratio between the mean allocation for the self (subtracted by 50) and the mean allocations to the other (subtracted by 50). Higher scores in the SVO angle represent individuals with higher cooperative preferences.

Cross-Societal Variables. {#s20}
-------------------------

We coded several cross-societal variables that could possibly moderate the amount of ingroup favoritism in cooperation. The coded variables used to test each hypothesis about cross-societal variation can be found in [*SI Appendix*, Table S5](#d35e347){ref-type="supplementary-material"}. The main sources were the World Value Survey and the World Data Bank. We also coded some additional variables for exploratory purposes, such as nepotism, collectivism, and norms of cooperation (see [*SI Appendix*](#d35e347){ref-type="supplementary-material"} for additional details). When testing our models, we also controlled for economic wealth (per capita gross domestic product) and inequality (Gini).

Analytical Strategy. {#s21}
--------------------

We used multilevel models where participants (level 2) and countries (level 3) were two random factors. These models considered random intercepts for participants nested in countries and also random slopes for the effect of group membership across the different countries. This model was selected after comparing this model with other models through the Akaike information criteria and the Bayesian information criteria ([@r36]). For trustworthiness behavior, we transformed each possible return choice to a percentage. Then, we computed the mean across the five return behavior scenarios (finale scale: 0--100). Data were analyzed with R (lme4 package) by using random intercept and slopes ([@r37]). We used contrast 1 (ingroup vs. outgroup and strangers), contrast 2, and common/unilateral knowledge as level-1 predictors in the models. Gender and SVO were level-2 predictors in the models. We allowed the effects of contrast 1 to vary across level 3. We didn't allow the effects of common/unilateral knowledge to vary across level 3, since this did not vary significantly across countries (*P* = 0.94).

Even though the human and financial costs of untreated PPD are well-established, adequate resources to address the global need of women suffering from PPD or who are at risk of developing PPD do not yet exist. Presently, the first line of psychological treatment for PPD is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). However, in a review of five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CBT with standard postpartum care, only two trials demonstrated better outcomes in the CBT group \[[@ref6]\]. While preliminary Interpersonal Therapy (IPT), with a focus on handling the interpersonal disputes that occur during childbirth and childcare, has shown some promise in addressing this pressing need \[[@ref7]\]. The first line of treatment for PPD continues to be medication \[[@ref8]\], particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which show some level of efficacy and perform equal to psychotherapy in randomized trials \[[@ref8],[@ref9]\]. However, there are concerns regarding the safety of antidepressants for pregnant and nursing women \[[@ref10]\].

There are many practical limitations to treatment seeking, not least being the availability of appropriately qualified therapists. In addition, issues such as stigma, childcare difficulties, lack of knowledge, and financial constraints can inhibit help seeking \[[@ref11]\]. As such, psychological resources that do not require women to leave their homes may allow for more women to participate in psychological interventions. In general, Internet interventions can be private and used anonymously, accessed repeatedly at any time, and from any location, and Internet interventions may provide a much-needed service to users who feel marginalized or stigmatized \[[@ref12]\]. Clatworthy's \[[@ref13]\] meta-analysis did not find a relationship between the length of an in-person preventative intervention and its effectiveness, suggesting that increasing the length of psychological interventions is not an important factor in enhancing benefit. However, there is research to show that interventions based on psychological models tend to be more effective than interventions that are not based on these models \[[@ref13]\], meaning that researchers seeking to create new resources for women should maintain fidelity to empirically supported psychological models.

As a result of the limitations that preclude many women from seeking in-person resources, Internet interventions offer promise in providing care with less financial and practical barriers. Additionally, Internet interventions can be used as adjuncts to in-person treatments or replacements in other cases \[[@ref14]\], and perhaps offer even more promise for reducing health disparities. Nonconsumable interventions, or those that can be reused with minimal cost for

Our previous study showed that Ang‐2 is closely related to vascular complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus[20](#jdi12519-bib-0020){ref-type="ref"}. However, how IL‐19 functions in type 2 diabetes mellitus, and whether Ang‐2 and IL‐19 play an important role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus have been scarcely reported. The purpose of the present study was to extend those initial observations, and to determine the concentrations of IL‐19 in type 2 diabetes mellitus and its complications, and to investigate the relationship of serum Ang‐2 and IL‐19 in type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Patient selection {#jdi12519-sec-0007}
-----------------

A total of 240 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (132 men and 108 women) treated at Binhai County Hospital, Jiangsu Province, China, were recruited in the present study. The average patient age was 62 ± 11 years. The duration of diabetes development from 6 to 14 years. The patients were diagnosed according to World Health Organization criteria[21](#jdi12519-bib-0021){ref-type="ref"}. Primary diagnoses (by clinical, electrocardiogram and imaging diagnosis) included macrovascular complications (*n* = 76, including heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and peripheral arterial disease), microvascular complications (*n* = 110, including diabetic nephropathy \[urinary albumin \>30 mg/24 h\], as well as diabetic retinopathy and diabetic peripheral neuropathy) and diabetic without vascular complications (*n* = 54). According to the number of macrovascular and microvascular injuries, respectively, patients with macrovascular or microvascular complications were divided into the following groups respectively: one kind of macrovascular complications group (*n* = 25) or microvascular complications group (*n* = 50), two kinds of macrovascular complications group (*n* = 30) or microvascular complications group (*n* = 35), and three kinds of macrovascular complications group (*n* = 21) or microvascular complications group (*n* = 25). The control group consisted of 30 men and 20 women, and the average age was 60 ± 15 years. The exclusion criteria included patients with evidence of neoplastic disease, acute or chronic infectious disease, and significant hepatic and renal disease. The study was approved by the Human Investigation Committee of BinHai County Hospital, and informed consent for all participants was obtained.

Laboratory analysis {#jdi12519

In this research, about one third of isolates in *S. pneumoniae* and *H. influenzae were* sourced from 61--80-year-old patients, followed by 0--20 and 41--60-year-olds, very similar to the investigation of Tian et al.[@CIT0012] About one half of *S. pneumoniae* from lower respiratory tract (sputum and trachea/lungs), and one quarter from blood indicated the common infection site of *S. pneumoniae*. The familiar relationship of *H. influenzae* with infection of respiratory tract reflected through two thirds of *H. influenzae* sourced from sputum and trachea/lungs. Compared with *H. influenzae*, more infections of the central nervous system were caused by *S. pneumoniae.*

As the most susceptible antibiotics against *S. pneumoniae*, vancomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, and levofloxacin must play an important role in empirical therapy of clinical infection disease caused by *S. pneumoniae*. We should pay attention to four nonsusceptible isolates to tigecycline in our study. There is no report about the resistant mechanism of *S. pneumoniae* collected from clinical disease against tigecycline. Cattoir et al[@CIT0013] analysis of five isolates of *Enterococcus feacium* which tigecycline nonsusceptible (three in vitro mutants and two clinical isolates). One amino acid substitution in RpsJ protein(S10 ribosomal protein) caused by four modifications was regarded as the main reason of increasing MIC of tigecycline in *E.feacium*. Lupien et al[@CIT0014] detected the resistance mutant isolates of *S. pneumoniae* against tigecycline induced in the laboratory. They found the resistance of tigecycline to gram-positive coccus correlated with ribosome constituents, such as ribosomal protein, 16S rRNA and rRNA methyltransferase, different from resistance to gram-negative bacilli mainly related with the efﬂux. There were 36 *S. pneumoniae* exhibited levofloxacin-nonsusceptible isolates in this study. Research of Schmitz et al[@CIT0015] verified that levoﬂoxacin-resistant *S. pneumoniae* associated with 1 or 2 point-mutations of quinolone resistance determining regions (QRDRs). In accordance with our results, these resistant isolates sourced from adult total, possibly because quinol

To test function of FGF signaling during hindgut morphogenesis, we first used SU5402 to broadly inhibit FGF activity pharmacologically. SU5402 disrupted endoderm cell movements and hindgut formation ([Fig. 3d](#F3){ref-type="fig"}, [Extended Data Fig. 6d](#F10){ref-type="fig"}, and [Supplemental Video 5](#SD8){ref-type="supplementary-material"}), suggesting a general role for FGF signaling. When a dominant negative form of the receptor FGFR1 (dnFGFR1 IRES GFP) was electroporated exclusively into the endoderm^[@R27]^, cell movements were similarly reduced ([Fig. 3d](#F3){ref-type="fig"} and [Supplemental Video 6](#SD9){ref-type="supplementary-material"}), demonstrating that FGF signaling is required specifically within the endoderm for hindgut morphogenesis. We next tested the effects of exogenous activation of the pathway by misexpressing *Fgf8* (Fgf8-IRES GFP) throughout the posterior endoderm. Interestingly, *Fgf8* misexpression phenocopied dnFGFR1, significantly reducing cell movements ([Fig. 3d](#F3){ref-type="fig"} and [Supplemental Video 6](#SD9){ref-type="supplementary-material"}). Despite a reduction in average cell velocity ([Fig. 3e](#F3){ref-type="fig"}), and loss of posterior compaction strains ([Extended Data Fig. 4](#F8){ref-type="fig"}), the degree of coordination among neighboring cell movements did not depend on FGF ([Extended Data Fig. 6g](#F10){ref-type="fig"}). This suggests that reduced cell movements likely result from a change in tissue-level forces, rather than loss of the mechanical coordination among neighboring cells. Disruption of cell movements by *dnFGFR1* and *Fgf8* misexpression ultimately resulted in failure to form the hindgut ([Fig. 3f](#F3){ref-type="fig"}).

To understand why activation and inhibition of FGF signaling similarly disrupt collective cell movements and hindgut formation, we asked whether altering the FGF gradient translates to changes in the tensional gradient. Indeed, inhibition of FGF signaling by *dnFGFR1* expression decreased tension in the posterior endoderm, while *Fgf8* misexpression significantly increased tension in the anterior endoderm ([Fig. 3g](#F3){ref-type="fig

Mean LOS (Standard deviation (SD)) was cross tabulated for patients who were admitted from home and discharged to home or nursing home. Case mix differences were identified between these two patient groups: significantly more females were discharged to nursing homes; patients discharged to nursing homes were older, more likely to be public patients with medical card over 70 years of age, and have a higher CCI. These case mix differences were adjusted for in a negative binomial regression model of the post-operative LOS (count variable regression). Ordinary least square (OLS) regression provided a poorer fit to the data.

Predictions from the specified model were used to obtain a set of adjusted LOS predictions, and hence calculate the individual difference between the observed and predicted LOS. A measure of additional LOS was then constructed for individuals with observed stay longer than the predicted stay. Patients with shorter observed stay than the predicted stay were assigned a zero value. Excess LOS was calculated as the stay beyond the predicted stay. The relation between the county specific mean excess stay and the rate of nursing homes per 100,000 people aged over 65 years were explored graphically and in a linear model. A negative parameter indicates an inverse relationship between excess stay and nursing home capacity.

National episode rates by sex and age {#Sec10}
-------------------------------------

During the years 2014 to 2018 inclusive, emergency abdominal surgery was performed in 4951 episodes for patients aged 65 years or older. The total number of episodes increased slightly each year, although the annual episode rate per 100,000 population remained within the range 148 to 162 per 100,000 over the study period. Table [1](#Tab1){ref-type="table"} summarises the patient characteristics by sex. There were more female than male patients (*p* = 0.02). Males patients were slightly younger than females (75.6 vs 76.5; *p* \< 0.01), the male average Charlson score was higher (7.6 vs 5.8, *p* \> 0.01), and more males were admitted with a cancer diagnosis

We used GW4869, a cell-permeable, selective inhibitor for neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) (obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc). Tick cells showed no cytotoxicity with 1 μM of GW4869 inhibitor treatment and hence we considered this dose in both experiments. DMSO was used as a vehicle control. A similar volume of DMSO that is equal to 1 μM GW4869 was used in our experiments. Tick cells were plated and incubated overnight and then treated with 1 μM GW4869 inhibitor for 4 h, followed by infection with LGTV for 72 h p.i. Before infection, we did not wash cells to remove the inhibitor.

Sphingomyelinase and SM Quantification Assays
---------------------------------------------

We used colorimetric sphingomyelinase or SM quantification assay kits from Sigma-Aldrich (USA) and followed the manufacturer\'s instructions. Sphingomyelinase assay was performed as described in our recent study (Zhou et al., [@B70]). Briefly, we plated 5 × 10^5^ tick cells, and after overnight incubation, cells were infected with LGTV (MOI 1) for either 24 or 72 h (p.i.) for both assays. Cell lysates were resuspended in 1 × PBS and processed for sphingomyelinase activity or SM lipid levels, immediately. For each time point and reaction well, 50 μl of samples (uninfected or LGTV-infected) was used as six replicates. Zero blank sphingomyelinase/SM standards were considered as background values, respectively, in each assay. Samples from sphingomyelinase or SM assays were measured at 655 or 570 nm absorbance, respectively. Using the standard values, curves were plotted and the amount of enzyme or lipid present in the samples was determined from the standard curve.

Statistics
----------

Statistical differences observed in data sets were analyzed using GraphPad Prism6 software and Microsoft Excel. The non-paired, two-tailed Student\'s *t*-test was performed (for data to compare two means) for the entire analysis. Each experiment was performed for three independent times and 5--10 replicates were considered in each experiment. Error bars represent mean (±SD) values, and *P*-values of \< 0.05 were considered significant in all analyses.

Alginate (Manugel GMB, FMC, Lot No. G9402001) was purified before use. A 1 wt % alginate solution in deionized water was stirred with activated charcoal Norit (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h, followed by filtration with 11 μm, 1.2 μm, 0.45 μm, and 0.2 μm Whatman membrane filters to remove particulate matter. Water was removed by lyophilization to yield white fibrous alginate. Alginate was characterized via NMR to determine the M/G block composition of the polymer. See the [Supporting Information](#notes-1){ref-type="notes"} for details.

General Procedure for Functionalization of Alginate with Norbornene Methylamine {#sec3.2}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alginate (0.0506 g, 2.56 × 10^--4^ mol COOH groups) was weighed into a glass vial and dissolved with 5 mL of MES buffer. pH was adjusted to 6.5 with NaOH. EDC-HCl (0.0446 g, 2.33 × 10^--4^ mol) and sulfo-NHS (0.0360 g, 1.66 × 10^--4^ mol) were weighed and added to the vial in one portion before being left to stir for 30 min. Then, the pH of the reaction solution was adjusted with a pH paper to approximately 8 using NaOH (1 M). 5-Norbornene-2-methylamine was then added, and reaction was left to stir for 18 h at room temperature (rt). The reaction solution was then transferred to a 10 kDa MWCO dialysis tube and dialyzed against NaCl solutions, starting from 100 mM, 50 mM, 25 mM, and finally deionized water, with change of dialysate every 10 to 18 h. Water was then removed via lyophilization to yield functionalized alginate (Alg-norb). Degree of functionalization was determined via NMR using dimethylformamide as an internal standard (see the [Supporting Information](#notes-1){ref-type="notes"} for details). Molecular weight and molar mass dispersity were measured via aqueous gel permeation chromatography (GPC) (data included in the [Supporting Information](#notes-1){ref-type="notes"}). This modification was also successfully carried out in 0.5 and 1 g scales.

Discussion
----------

While treatment protocols, early embryo development, and laboratory techniques have considerably improved over the last decades in ART cycles, little has been identified about the events that occur after the transfer of embryos in to the uterine cavity. About 75% of embryos do not implant after transfer. Thus, to improve implantation rates we need additional understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing the endometrial preparation for embryo implantation ([@B11] -[@B13] ).

According to our data, for better embryo implantation it is necessary to have a good embryo with appropriate morphology and developmental potential as well as a high concentration of HCG. In this study we have hypothesized that HCG supplementation in the secretory phase of the endometrium during the frozen embryo cycle may increase the implantation and eventually the pregnancy rate. However our findings have contradicted with this hypothesis.

Our study showed that HCG supplementation for endometrial preparation in cryopreserved cycles had no more benefit than estradiol and progesterone. Our finding was consistent with the Ben-Meir et al. study where the researchers observed that recombinant HCG supplementation during the secretory phase of the frozen-thawed embryo transfer cycles showed no advantage in terms of pregnancy and implantation rates ([@B9] ). Similar to our study, they did not use a GnRH agonist for down-regulation, and thus endogenous basal LH secretion was not completely suppressed. Tesarik et al. ([@B14] ) demonstrated that HCG supplementation during the luteal phase of the oocyte donation cycle improved pregnancy rates only in cycles with low endogenous LH.

Mansour et al. ([@B15] ) have shown that intrauterine injection of 500 IU HCG prior to embryo transfer significantly increased pregnancy rate after ART. They concluded that the HCG level positively correlated with the level of trophoblastic tolerance.

HCG plays a central role in controlling implantation and early embryonic development ([@B16] ). This hormone is produced very early by the developing embryo and is secreted in relatively high concentrations. HCG may effectively regulate endometrial preparation via the following processes ([@B17] ): i. local down-regulation of insulin growth factor binding protein 1 (IGF BP-1) by HCG leads to the prolongation of the window of endometrium; ii. HCG augments the endometrial receptivity by increasing angiogenesis through increased local vasoendothelial growth factor (VEGF) ([@B18] , [@B19] ); iii.HCG interacts with the production of galactosemic fibroblast (M-GSF) and leukemia inhibiting factor (

In grafted male mice, E~2~ and P~4~ concentrations were significantly higher than those in control mice. The experimental and control groups showed notable differences in the plasma T4 level. The control group showed the highest level of T4 (32.71 ± 0.95), which was significant compared with those of the other groups. In addition, the highest and lowest levels of T4 were observed in the FOT+ (18.20 ± 0.58) and VOT (10.60 ± 0.74) groups, respectively, but these differences were not significant ([Table 5](#T5){ref-type="table"}). However, the VOT group (0.04 ± 0.00) had the lowest testis weight 3 weeks after transplantation, which was comparable to the other control and experimental groups.

*In vitro* maturation, fertilization and embryo development
-----------------------------------------------------------

Progression to MII stage was significantly higher in oocytes derived from the FOT+ group (51.54% ± 2.87) than in those derived from the other groups, while VOT group showed the lowest comparative MΠ rate and the highest total degeneration rate (14.28% ± 2.88 and 33.88% ± 3.47, respectively) ([Table 6](#T6){ref-type="table"}). The fertility rate in the VOT group (30.00% ± 13.33) was significantly different from the FOT and FOT+ groups (61.16% ± 5.68 and 69.83% ± 4.71, respectively). There was no significant difference between the VOT+ (51.66% ± 3.88) and the other groups ([Table 7](#T7){ref-type="table"}) for the fertility rate. The rates of formation of 2, 4 and 8-cell embryos in the VOT group (30.00% ± 15.27, 10.00% ± 12.47 and 10.00% ± 12.47, respectively) were significantly lower than those in the other groups. In addition, there was a significant difference in the embryos that reached the morula stage between the FOT+ (35.83% ± 4.97), VOT (0.00% ± 7.63) and VOT+ groups (15.00% ± 0.00) ([Table 8](#T8){ref-type="table"}, [Fig .5](#F5

Because NDR1 potentiates NF-κB signaling in the presence of TNFα ligand[@b18], we wished to evaluate the effect of SOCS2 on this aspect of NDR1 function due to its potential implications for clarifying the mechanisms behind SOCS2 anti-inflammatory actions, as mentioned above. However, before delving on to the functional implications of SOCS2 perturbations on NDR1-potentiated NF-κB signaling, we first asked what is the role of SOCS2 in TNFα-induced NF-κB activation in MEFs under our experimental conditions. IB analysis of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts showed that MEFs depleted of SOCS2 (SOCS2^KD^) had significantly higher nuclear p65 levels, as compared to wild-type (SOCS2^WT^) cells, after stimulation with TNFα ([Fig. 4A](#f4){ref-type="fig"}). We obtained similar results using high-content quantitative imaging (HCQI) ([Figure S2A, B](#S1){ref-type="supplementary-material"} and [Fig. 4B,C](#f4){ref-type="fig"}) which allowed detection of nuclear p65 quantitatively *in situ*[@b19][@b20]. Consistently, SOCS2^KD^ cells were hyper-responsive to TNFα ligand with respect to NF-κB activity as determined by luciferase reporter assay ([Fig. 4D](#f4){ref-type="fig"}) and changes in mRNA levels of the NF-κB target gene IL-6 ([Figure S2C](#S1){ref-type="supplementary-material"} and [Fig. 4E](#f4){ref-type="fig"}). We also observed that SOCS2 depletion resulted in changes in proteins secreted by TNFα-stimulated MEFs that promoted NF-κB transactivation in wild-type cells (i.e., in a paracrine manner) ([Fig. 4F--I](#f4){ref-type="fig"}). We contextualize our *in vitro* data in an *in vivo* setting by using the murine DSS (dextran sodium sulphate) model of ulcerative colitis (UC)[@b21] where TNFα is a major driving factor[@b22]. DSS-administered induction of UC has not been previously reported in SOCS2 knock-out (SOCS2^−/−^) mice. We found that in comparison to wild type mice, colonic tissue from SOCS2^−/−^ mice showed exacerbated inflammation upon DSS

A comparison between [Figures 2](#pone-0056398-g002){ref-type="fig"} and [3](#pone-0056398-g003){ref-type="fig"} revealed that the main WNF outbreak peak in humans appeared 2--3 weeks after the extreme temperature anomalies had occurred.

Pearson and lag correlations results ([Table 1](#pone-0056398-t001){ref-type="table"}) are described on a meteorological stations scale. Significant and positive linkages (0.31≤r≤0.65) were detected between temperature and a number of WNF cases for the Russian stations at lags of 2--4 weeks but not for the concurrent week (lag 0). Positive correlations were also detected for Romania: in Bucharest at lags of 2--3 weeks and in Constanta at lags of 1--4 weeks (0.33≤r≤0.61). In general, the strongest lag time results were obtained for the northern countries (Russia and Romania). In contrast, in southern and hotter countries (Israel and Greece), the correlations appeared in the same week (lag 0) and presented an immediate response. At these stations, significance was also observed at longer lag-times of 1--2 weeks in Thessaloniki (Greece), for all lags in Larissa (Greece, for minimum and mean temperature), at lags of 1--3 weeks for Ben-Gurion Airport station (minimum temperatures), and for Haifa, Israel (mean temperature). Weak associations were found for the Turkish stations at lags of 3--4 weeks. A different pattern was detected for Budapest with significant results (0.32≤r≤0.50) at lags of 6--7 weeks. Correlations were not computed for Italy and Spain because of sample size constraints.

Sensitivity was better than chance at more peripheral positions from the cue, suggesting that presaccadic attention was not exclusively allocated to the saccade target^[@CR18],[@CR30],[@CR31]^. We attribute his effect to the use of transient discrimination targets. Indeed, to evaluate the deployment of attention in an unstructured visual field we used transient discrimination targets, that to some extent capture by themselves attention^[@CR35],[@CR36]^. With such a protocol, performance was maintained high across space, allowing us to make interpretations only on the modulation of presaccadic attention across conditions, rather than to draw conclusions about the absolute deployment of attention.

We studied the deployment of attention before the execution of saccades across different conditions. Thus, we measured behaviorally the consequences of feedback activations of the priority maps (Frontal Eye Fields ---FEF---, Superior Colliculus ---SC--- and the parietal cortex --LIP--) onto the feature maps (V1-V4) of the visual cortex^[@CR37],[@CR38]^. Different studies indeed have demonstrated strong connectivity between oculomotor and feature maps preceding the execution of a saccade^[@CR39]--[@CR41]^. These studies demonstrated the existence of a strong link between oculomotor and attentional processes. Nevertheless, they did not necessarily support the existence of an activity of the oculomotor system preceding any deployment of attention as suggested by the premotor theory of attention^[@CR10],[@CR11]^. Here, following the offset of visual inputs, we observed a large spread of presaccadic attention that was not accompanied by a spread of the saccade endpoints. We hypothesize that these effects are the consequence of a neural dissociation between visual and motor cells within the priority maps^[@CR42],[@CR43]^. Indeed, it was shown that motor cells within FEF or SC stayed completely silent during an attention task made at fixation^[@CR39],[@CR44],[@CR45]^, while visual and visuo-motor cells displayed sustained attentional effects. Moreover, it has been shown that LIP inactivation can disrupt attentional capabilities while leaving oculomotor processes intact^[@CR46],[@CR47]^, contrary to inactivation of FEF and SC^[@CR48],[@CR49]^, which tend to also disrupt eye movements. If such neural dissociation would explain our findings, the spread of presaccadic attention observed without the presence of the cue could reflect the necessity of constant inputs for the proper precise functioning of visual neurons, on the contrary of visuo-motor and motor cells which

The hydrogels thermal stability was evaluated by TGA, and the results were shown in [Figure 3](#polymers-09-00119-f003){ref-type="fig"}. The weight of all the studied samples decreased progressively as the temperature increased. The initial weight loss for all hydrogel samples was attributed to the evaporation of residual moisture in the dried hydrogel matrices. PNIPAAm homopolymer was found to be the most thermally stable and started to decompose in a temperature range of 300--580 °C, while CNC was comparatively the least thermally stable, having degradation at 250 to 475 °C ([Figure 3](#polymers-09-00119-f003){ref-type="fig"}). Interestingly, the addition of CNCs to PNIPAAm led to thermal instability. This decrease in the thermal stability of hydrogels could be explained by the high surface area of cellulose nanoparticles, which provided more explosive surface area, leading to the acceleration of their thermal degradation \[[@B63-polymers-09-00119]\], and high amounts of CNCs destroyed the interaction between polymer molecules, resulting in an increase in PNIPAAm molecular mobility \[[@B64-polymers-09-00119]\]. Therefore, the increase of CNC contents resulted in more gradual thermal transitions that occurred within slightly wider temperature ranges. As expected, the blended CNC hydrogel sample (NC-50+) exhibited different thermal behavior to its grafted counterpart (NC-50), showing less gradual thermal transition. Moreover, the degradation temperatures at different stages of decomposition for the blended CNC hydrogel mostly shifted to lower values in comparison to all the grafted hydrogels.

3.3. Volume Phase Transition Temperature (VPTT) {#sec3dot3-polymers-09-00119}
-----------------------------------------------

The VPTT is a key parameter of thermo-responsive hydrogels. Below the VPTT, hydrogels are hydrophilic and swollen in water. In contrast, above the VPTT, they become hydrophobic and abruptly decrease in volume (collapsed state) \[[@B65-polymers-09-00119],[@B66-polymers-09-00119]\]. The VPTT of PNIPAAm-CNC hydrogels was investigated by optical absorption spectroscopy using a fixed volume of fully swollen hydrogels (200 µL), which were obtained by soaking 20 mg of freeze-dried hydrogels in distilled water for three days. All of the PNIPAAm-CNC hydrogels clearly exhibited phase transition behaviors, as shown in [Figure 4](#polymers-09-

For fluoromicroscopic determination of positive apoptosis cells, 95 μL of suspension cells (approximately 1 × 10^5^/μL) were mixed with 0.1% acridine orange/ethidium bromide (Sigma) and observed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).

### Western blot analysis of U251 cells {#sec3-6}

Total protein was extracted from 1 × 10^6^ harvested sample cells with protein lysis buffer (5 M EDTA, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM NaF, 0.1% Igepal, 0.5 mM Na~3~VO~4~, 0.5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and antiprotease mixture) using the freeze-thaw method\[[@ref29]\]. The lysates were centrifuged at 15 000 × g for 30 minutes. Determination of protein concentrations of the supernatants was performed by the Bradford procedure\[[@ref30]\] (Bio-Rad Laboratory, Hercules, CA, USA). The rabbit anti-survivin, Bcl-2, cyclin D1, c-Myc and caspase-3 polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotech Inc (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). For survivin, Bcl-2, cyclin D1, c-Myc and caspase-3 analysis, the supernatant containing 50 μg total protein was separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto polyvinylidine fluoride membranes (Milipore, Bedford, MA, USA) and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma). Blots were incubated with specific antibodies against the above described antigens and rabbit anti-β-actin antibody (Santa Cruz) at 4°C overnight, washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 and subjected to corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:2 000; Health Research (Shanghai) Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) at room temperature for 2 hours. Blots were then washed with PBS and 0.1% Tween-20, and the absorbance was visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom).

All participants were scheduled for a diagnostic interview at the police outpatient clinic for the assessment of trauma‐related symptoms. The police outpatient clinic is an independent national centre in the Netherlands where clinical diagnosticians, psychologist, and psychiatrists are specialized in investigating trauma‐related symptoms in police officers (van der Meer et al., [2016](#mpr1579-bib-0043){ref-type="ref"}). Researchers contacted the participants by telephone prior to their diagnostic interview to provide information about the study aim and procedures. The researchers explained by phone that the aim of the study was to investigate if a mobile application was able to correctly assess mental health and identify trauma‐related symptoms after stressful events. It was explained that the mobile application contained questions about mental health, particularly following trauma, and that the app did not provide feedback on mental health status. Participants were asked to complete SAM once, prior to their scheduled diagnostic interview, on their own personal device. Participants could decide when and where they wanted to fill in SAM.

Participants were informed that all obtained data would be treated as strictly confidential and that only the researchers would have access to the data. The clinical diagnosticians at the police outpatient clinic were blind to the participants\' results in SAM. If a person orally consented to participate in the study, the researchers e‐mailed a digital study information brochure and a web link to open SAM. Participants were asked to complete all the questions within SAM in one session. The mean time between completing SAM and the diagnostic interview was 5.6 days (*SD* = 4.6). Of the 89 participants, 76.4% completed SAM within a week prior to the diagnostic interview. This study was conducted in compliance with ethical principles. The Medical Ethical Committee of the Academic Medical Centre exempted this study from formal review.

SAM is a web‐based app that can be used on a smartphone, PC, or tablet. SAM assesses several mental health domains that might be affected after PTEs, including PTSD symptoms, general functioning, depression, anxiety, stress, work engagement, substance use, and physical functioning. In addition, SAM evaluates well‐known risk factors (trauma exposure and peritraumatic reactions) as well as protective factors (social support and psychological resilience) that may influence these mental health

Analytical instruments {#Sec4}
----------------------

The optical absorbance spectrum of the MoS~2~ functionalized optical fiber sensor was recorded at a scan rate of 600 nm min^−1^ over a wavelength range of 200--800 nm by a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 5000, Agilent Technologies, U.S.A). The X-Ray diffraction analysis was achieved with a Bruker D8 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (wavelength = 1.546 Å) at the scan rate of 4° min^−1^. The morphological characterization of the fabricated biosensor was performed by field-emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S4800; accelerating voltage 2--4 KV). The Raman analysis was performed using a Raman spectrophotometer (excitation wavelength: 514 nm) (Renishaw, UK). The confocal laser scanning microscopic (LSM 510) (Zeiss, Germany) was used for morphological analysis of the bio functionalized sensing probe. The exfoliated MoS~2~ nanosheets were analysed using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (Applied voltage: 200 kV) (JEOL 2010, Japan).

Experimental setup {#Sec5}
------------------

The experimental setup employed to study the SPR biosensor performance is presented in Fig. [1](#Fig1){ref-type="fig"}. The developed sensor (Anti-BSA/MoS~2~/Au optical fiber) was positioned in a glass flow cell having definite inlet and outlet passages. Non-polarized polychromatic light from broadband source (wavelength range: 360--2400 nm; output power: 6.7 mW; Ocean Optics, HL-2000,) was launched at one end of the fiber optic sensor. The transmission spectra were recorded through charge-coupled device (CCD) spectrometer (λ: 200--1160 nm; resolution: 0.09--20 nm; Avantes, ULS2048XL-EVO) connected to another end of the sensor. The computer was interfaced with the spectrometer to record the spectral response at different concentrations of the BSA.Figure 1Diagrammatic representation of the SPR biosensor experimental system for the detection of BSA. The time of interaction between Anti-BSA antibodies and BSA sample was 15 minutes.

2.3. Government-Supported Programs Offer Potential Assistance {#sec2dot3-nutrients-08-00262}
-------------------------------------------------------------

In the United States, national food and nutrition programs have been established for older adult populations. Specifically, the Older Americans Act Nutrition Program (OAANP) provides congregate and/or home-delivered meals, nutritional screening, and nutrition education and counseling to adults 60 and older. In 2013, the OAANP program provided 219 million meals to 2.6 million older adults \[[@B42-nutrients-08-00262]\]. As a result of participating, 73% of congregate meal participants and 81% of home delivered meal participants reported eating healthier diets. Despite these findings, previous studies have shown this population to have high prevalence of obesity \[[@B35-nutrients-08-00262]\], obesity-related health problems \[[@B43-nutrients-08-00262]\], inappropriate eating behaviors \[[@B44-nutrients-08-00262]\], poor nutritional status \[[@B45-nutrients-08-00262]\], and food insecurity \[[@B39-nutrients-08-00262]\] making this a well suited candidate population for healthy weight maintenance/weight loss interventions. West *et al.* implemented the Diabetes Prevention Program, a 12-week evidence-based weight-loss program, in 15 senior centers using trained lay health educators \[[@B46-nutrients-08-00262]\]. Participants in the DPP lost significantly more weight compared to the cognitive behavior control (−3.7 kg *vs*. −0.3 kg; *p* \< 0.001). Furthermore, 38% of DPP participants lost ≥5% of their body weight compared with only 5% in the control group who lost the same amount of weight (*p* \< 0.001). This study, along with others has shown that improvements in consumption of fruit and vegetables \[[@B47-nutrients-08-00262]\], physical activity \[[@B48-nutrients-08-00262],[@B49-nutrients-08-00262]\], physical function \[[@B49-nutrients-08-00262]\], and levels of hemoglobin A1C \[[@B50-nutrients-08-00262]\] can positively benefit the health of high risk, vulnerable older adults. Senior centers in the U.S. and community centers worldwide \[[@B51-nutrients-08-00262]\] can provide an ideal environment in which to implement evidence-based programs that promote healthy weight maintenance and/or loss, consumption of nutrient dense foods, and safe physical activity

Finally, to further confirm the association between the two proteins, we checked their interaction at the endogenous level in the absence of any exogenous expression. As A20 is expressed at basal conditions in T cells, we decided to evaluate the interaction between these two proteins in Jurkat T cells by doing a co-immunoprecipitation experiment using anti-A20- or anti-RNF114-specific antibodies. We confirmed the association between these two proteins in reciprocal experiments, even if the interaction was more obvious when the anti-RNF114 antibody was used to co-immunoprecipitate A20 ([Figure 2a](#fig2){ref-type="fig"}). This result suggests that only a fraction of A20 is associated to RNF114. However, we cannot exclude that those differences reflect the capacity of each antibody to recognize and bind these interacting molecules ([Figure 2a](#fig2){ref-type="fig"}). We checked whether the interaction between these two proteins was modified after stimulation. For that purpose, Jurkat T cells were stimulated as indicated with TNF*α* or CD3/CD28 antibodies. We observed that the association increased after TNF*α* stimulation ([Figure 2b](#fig2){ref-type="fig"}), likely as a consequence of an increase in A20 levels after such stimuli. Interestingly, after TCR stimulation, we observed an increase in A20-RNF114 interaction and also a striking modification of A20 molecular weight associated with RNF114 ([Figure 2b](#fig2){ref-type="fig"}). These results indicate that under these stimulation conditions, the fraction of A20 able to interact with RNF114 was post-translationally modified. This modified form of A20 is not detectable in the whole lysate extract (INPUT) or after A20 immunoprecipitation (data not shown), supporting the notion that this modified form of A20 specifically bound to RNF114 is a small fraction of the total A20 protein pool. According to the shift in molecular weight of the modified A20, the main band could correspond to modification by a member of the ubiquitin family rather than phosphorylation, which will be more difficult to resolve on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Furthermore, after CD3/CD28 stimulation we also observed multiple slow migrating forms of A20, disposed in a pattern that is more typical of polyubiquitylation ([Figure 2b](#fig2){ref-type="fig"}). However, treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 did not affect the amount or the accumulation of high-molecular-weight forms

MPE with anaplastic features is a rare occurrence, with only three case reports in the literature \[[Table 1](#T1){ref-type="table"}\].\[[@ref3][@ref4][@ref5]\] Similar to the previous three reports, the present case shows a dominant mass arising from the spinal column. However, widespread presence of metastases at diagnosis as well as rapid progression is noteworthy in our case. It is unclear as to why this present case had such aggressive progression of disease. The MIB-1 (Ki-67) index of 8--38% is similar to the previous three reports, two of which had no recurrence.

Clinical findings and outcomes in three previously reported cases of myxopapillary ependymoma with anaplastic features

![](SNI-9-191-g004)

The immunohistochemical description of MPE has been reported, which consist of positivity for GFAP and vimentin, consistent with the present case.\[[@ref2][@ref7][@ref20]\]

Conventional MPE have a favorable overall survival, but despite their low-grade designation, almost half of all patients experience local recurrence (2--15 years after operation), irrespective of adequate excision.\[[@ref1][@ref10][@ref20]\] Recurrences can be accompanied with dissemination, with most metastases restricted regionally within the spine, although rare cranial metastases have been reported.\[[@ref1]\] Many of these patients can undergo salvage therapy with radiation. As a result, frequent surveillance scanning of patients with MPE is recommended to identify recurrent disease early.

The 5-year survival rate of patients with anaplastic ependymoma, on the other hand, has been reported to be less than 20%. Radiotherapy following partial excision is then recommended.

Grading of ependymoma is currently difficult and of questionable clinical utility under the current WHO guidelines.\[[@ref9]\] For anaplastic ependymoma specifically, Ho *et al*. had put forward a prognostic calculator based on a histopathologic score that takes into account mitoses (\>= 4/10 per high-power field), hypercellularity, endothelial proliferation, necrosis. They furthermore proposed that anaplastic ependymoma could be diagnosed by the presence of two of those parameters.\[[@ref11]\] However, the classification of CNS tumors is moving toward a more molecularly oriented classification scheme, as reflected in the 2016 WHO classification of CNS tumors.\[[@ref15]\] So far, the RELA fusion-protein positive ependymoma is

Before the test, the pups were allowed at least 7 days to acclimate to the housing conditions. The body weights of the animals were gradually reduced to 85% of their free-feeding weights and maintained at that level with a restricted feeding schedule. Water was available *ad libitum* throughout the experiment. All testing was performed between 9:30 a.m. and 1 p.m.

Behavioral tests
----------------

The animals were tested in standard operant chambers (ENV-007; MED Associates, St. Albans, Vermont, USA), enclosed in sound-attenuating cubicles with built-in C.C.T.V. systems. Behavioral boxes were 30.5 cm high, 29 cm wide, and 24 cm long, with grid floors of stainless steel bars (4.8 mm diameter, spaced 1.6 cm apart). Each box was equipped with a retractable lever (ENV-112B; MED Associates), dispenser (ENV-203; MED Associates) for the delivery of 45 mg food pellets (Improved Formula A, P. J. Noyes, Lancaster, New Hampshire, USA), and a speaker for the introduction of white masking noise. The boxes were controlled and data were collected using the MED-PC program for IBM computers (MED Associates).

During each autoshaping trial, the lever was extended into the chamber for 15 seconds at random intervals, each intermission ranging from 22 to 68 seconds, with an average interval of 45 seconds. One food pellet was delivered 4 seconds after the lever was retracted regardless of whether the rat made a lever touch response.

A daily session consisted of 12 trials and the procedure continued up to the 12th session. The extended lever touch was defined as a correct lever touch, and the maximum number of touches in a session was 12. In this learning task, animals learned to associate food reinforcement with the correct extended lever touch.

Following the autoshaping trials, rats were subjected to the modified PR schedule. For the daily session, the lever was extended for 15 minutes, during which food pellets were delivered contingent upon the completion of a fixed number of lever presses. Each lever press needed 20 g of pressing power. For the first session, rats were automatically adjusted to a progressive fixed ratio (FR) (PFR) 1 (PFR 1; one pellet for one lever press) schedule. A small piece of white cloth (1.5 × 2.5 cm) was attached to the lever to allow

Firefighting is a hazardous task associated with a heavy workload where task duration may be limited by air cylinder capacity. Increased fitness may lead to better air ventilation efficiency and task duration at a given heavy work intensity.

Methods
=======

Thirteen male firefighters (age: 28.4 ± 5.1 years; height: 175.5 ± 4.5 cm; mass: 84.4 ± 9.0 kg; VO~2~peak: 47.8 ± 5.1 mLO~2~.min^-1^.kg^-1^) completed the following tests on 3 different days while wearing firefighting protective clothing (FPC), self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and air cylinder: 1- The graded walking test (GWT) for measuring different physiological parameters while connected to a metabolic system (gas exchanges); 2- The 10 METS treadmill test (T10) designed to measure the time to ventilate air from the cylinder at 10 METS, the intensity needed to complete the fire fit test work simulation described by Deakin et al. (1) within 8 min (2); 3- The simulated work circuit (SWC) to measure the time needed to perform a test mimicking different firefighting tasks while wearing FPC and breathing with the SCBA. Participants performed the SWC as quickly as possible while respecting regulations of the test protocol. Moreover, skeletal muscle oxygenation (deoxyhemoglobin, HHb) was measured during all three tests.

Results
=======

Firefighters who performed the SWC in a shorter time had lower air cylinder ventilation values on the T10 (*r*= -0.495, *P*\< 0.05), better peak oxygen consumption (*r*= -0.924, *P*\< 0.001) during the GWT and performed longer until exhaustion on the GWT (*r*= -0.789, *P*\< 0.001). Participants who completed the SWC more rapidly and reached a higher VO~2~peak also had lower V~E~and V~E~/VO~2~values during submaximal workload on the GWT. Moreover, they had greater skeletal muscle deoxygenation during the SWC (HHb, *r*= -0.593, *P*\< 0.05).

Discussion
==========

Greater aerobic fitness was associated with greater air ventilation efficiency of faster firefighters on the SWC. According to Holmér and Gavhed (3), cardiovascular strain is

Patients with CKD need additional ESA treatment. А number of articles discussed the benefits and possible risks associated with ESA treatment ([@R2],[@R8]-[@R10]). Many clinical trials and observational studies in CKD populations, both on and off dialysis, demonstrated the benefits of normalizing hemoglobin (Hb) levels. This prompted frequent revisions of the guidelines for the management of CKD anemia ([@R5],[@R7],[@R11]-[@R16]).

The key question addressed was whether the optimal Hb target for CKD patients in the range of 110.0 to 120.0 g/L was achieved. Challenges to the effectiveness and safety of ESAs were emphasized when some clinical trials showed no benefit or induced harm related to cardiovascular outcomes in patients targeted to higher Hb levels. In CKD patients receiving ESA therapy, the Hb target should not be lower than 90.0 g/L and greater than 130.0 g/L. It is reasonable to personalize therapy as some patients may experience improvements in QoL at higher Hb concentration. It means that ESA therapy may start above 100.0 g/L. The correction of Hb concentration should be based on post dialysis values, namely dry Hb concentrations ([@R17]-[@R21]).

Many guidelines provide advice to physicians on how to screen CKD patients for anemia and when and how to treat patients with different medications. It is essential to know how to safely prescribe epoetin ESAs and route of administration, as well as assess and optimize iron stores. In addition, it is important to know how to diagnose and manage complications associated with anemia and the drugs administered for its treatment. Guidelines also help define the areas where evidence is lacking and research is needed ([@R6],[@R17],[@R18],[@R22]-[@R24]).

Exogenous replacement of erythropoietin by recombinant human erythropoietin as ESAs has become a widely accepted therapy of renal anemia. Three forms are available for clinical use: epoetin alpha, epoetin beta (darbepoetin alpha), and methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta as continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (C.E.R.A. or Mircera®). The treatment of patients on hemodialysis with ESAs has greatly advanced the management of renal anemia ([@R8]-[@R10],[@R25]).

Epoetin alpha has relatively short half-life of 8.5 hours and requires more frequent administration, generally two to three times per week. Darbepo

Evaluation of a PCS-targeting vaccine in nonhuman primates {#Sec6}
==========================================================

Nonhuman primates (NHP) are the best animal models to evaluate candidate vaccines for human pathogens. PCS peptides delivered by recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus and nanoparticles (PCS vaccine) were tested in a pilot study as a preventative vaccine candidate using a cynomolgus macaque SIV infection model. Based on promising results from this pilot study, the vaccine is currently being validated and further characterized in a larger-scale study, in comparison with vaccines against full Gag and Env proteins.

Conclusion {#Sec7}
==========

Based on the correlates of natural immunity to HIV resistance and our preliminary data from nonhuman primate study, the new vaccine strategy targeting the viral protease cleavage sites is feasible and promising. It needs to be further studied and refined towards the development of an effective HIV vaccine.

The polymorphism rate of mitochondrial genes was approx. 24 % variable sites and about 14 % parsimony-informative sites. Sequences of EF1-α fragments were slightly more variable (about 32 % variable sites and 21 % parsimony-informative sites).

Phylogenetic analysis {#Sec8}
---------------------

MP heuristic searches for COI sequences resulted in one cladeogram (length = 329, consistency index (CI) = 0.5471, retention index (RI) = 0.5300), based on 65 parsimony informative characters. MP heuristic searches for EF1-α sequences resulted in one cladeogram (length = 488, consistency index (CI) = 0.7807, retention index (RI) = 0.8431), based on 172 parsimony informative characters. The GTR+I+G model was chosen for COI (proportion of invariable sites I = 0.5531; gamma distribution shape parameter G = 0.6594) and the GTR+G model for EF1-α (proportion of invariable sites I = 0; gamma distribution shape parameter G = 0.2270), as the best nucleotide substitution model for analyses and pairwise distance calculations.

Decreased pectin content and cold tolerance in *OsBURP16* transgenic plants
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To investigate the function of *OsBURP16*, cDNA of *OsBURP16* was cloned into the vector pUN1301, which is driven by the maize ubiquitin (*Ubi*) promoter (Fig. [2](#fig02){ref-type="fig"}a). This construct was introduced into the wild-type rice cultivar Zhonghua 10 (ZH10) by *Agrobacterium*-mediated transformation. Three independent *Ubi::OsBURP16* transgenic lines (OE3, OE4 and OE6) were confirmed by Southern blot analysis (Fig. [2](#fig02){ref-type="fig"}b). qRT-PCR analysis revealed that the transcription levels of *OsBURP16* were increased 2.1-, 5.4- and 3.4-fold in the T3 progeny of OE3, OE4 and OE6, respectively (Fig. [2](#fig02){ref-type="fig"}c). There was no obvious difference in the morphology of *Ubi::OsBURP16* transgenic rice plants compared with ZH10 at different developmental stages under normal conditions (Fig. [2](#fig02){ref-type="fig"}d--g). As such, these three independent transgenic lines (OE3, OE4 and OE6) with relatively high expression levels of *OsBURP16* were chosen for subsequent experiments. Attempts to generate mutants or RNAi plants of *OsBURP16* have so far not been successful, but are ongoing.

Discussion {#S8}

An outstanding challenge in spatial transcriptomics is the expression mapping of small non-parenchymal tissue cells. Here, we introduced paired-cell sequencing, a method that extracts spatial information from attached adjacent parenchymal cells. We used this approach to uncover a high degree of spatial heterogeneity of LECs, with around 35% of LEC genes zonated. We also inferred the molecular signature of pericentral LECs, an important liver niche that secretes key morphogens such as Wnts and Rspo3, and identified an expression of the Wnt antagonist Dkk3 in a sub-population of the LECs that line the central vein that was distinct from the Wnt-producing cells ([Fig. 5d,e](#F5){ref-type="fig"}). Expression of both Wnt ligands and Dkk antagonists has been demonstrated in niche cells of the intestine and hair-follicle[@R35]--[@R37]. Our findings highlight a potential balancing effect of these positive and negative regulators of liver Wnt signaling by pericentral LECs.

To extend the zonation profiles to genes that are also expressed in hepatocytes we extracted a large panel of LEC landmark genes from the pcRNASeq data and used it to localize the single LECs along the lobule radial axis. This revealed zonation profiles for genes that were masked by the hepatocyte expression in the paired-cell data. While more genes could be examined with this approach, the spatial resolution of this reconstruction was lower (four layers vs. eight layers for the pcRNAseq data). Technologies that provide more sequenced cells[@R38],[@R39] along with higher capture rate[@R40] could facilitate a higher spatial resolution and statistical power for identifying additional zonated lowly-expressed genes. Thus, our study demonstrated the utility of pcRNAseq not only for inferring zonation profiles of NPC-specific genes, but also as a method for unbiased detection of a large panel of NPC landmark genes, to be used in single-cell based spatially resolved transcriptomics.

While our reconstruction had high spatial resolution, it did not capture the entire complexity of LECs, due to limitations related to the parenchymal cells used for spatial inference. Endothelial cells are comprised of arterial, venous and sinusoidal cells[@R22],[@R41]. A hepatocyte at a given radial lobule layer is often spatially adjacent to more than one type of LEC. For example, sorted pericentral hepatocytes can either carry

Lockhart *et al*. have reviewed the importance and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) for anaesthesiologists and other airway managers.[@CR1] They point out that "PPE donning and doffing requires education and practice prior to their use during patient care", going on to state that " the more unfamiliar staff is with PPE, the more likely they will incorrectly don and doff it". Weissman *et al.*[@CR2] have expressed the need for fundamental research to inform PPE recommendations, particularly in the setting of tracheal intubation. They cite the recent work of Feldman *et al*.[@CR3] who showed that, in a simulated setting, currently recommended PPE may not prevent exposure of those who perform tracheal intubation. One critical aspect of the efficacy of PPE in protecting healthcare workers (HCWs) is the manner in which donning is performed. A closer examination of training in donning and doffing PPE is warranted.

During the coronavirus disease pandemic, the circumstances under which donning and doffing of PPE is being learned, trained, and subsequently performed may be suboptimal. Although no overview exists of the training practices for donning and doffing PPE, it is likely that it is less than ideal.

Ideally, in designing a training program for a new procedure, one would: 1) share a description of the procedure with "trainees" that contains unambiguous definitions of each step, and common and critical errors; 2) apply a pre-training preparation standard; 3) provide real-world materials (e.g., PPE) for repeated deliberate practice; 4) provide multiple training sessions based on performance; and 5) undertake an "exit" assessment. The "graduate trainee" would then transfer their newly acquired skills into the real world with experienced supervision.

Of course, one might argue that the current pandemic requires that prompt action is required during which perfect is the enemy of good. In fact, scientifically rigorous training methodology exists which ensures that a newly learned procedure is performed competently. The discipline of anesthesiology has been at the forefront of training to a pre-defined level of competency.[@CR4] Proficiency-based progression and other forms of metrics-based training decrease the incidence of errors amongst novice practitioners and the evidence of its consistent efficacy is particularly strong for procedural skills.[@CR5] It is possible that the difficulties in donning and doffing PPE are underestimated.

ET-Receptor Blockade in Chronic Kidney Disease {#s0045}
==============================================

Receptor antagonists have emerged as the only strategy in the clinic for blocking the unwanted actions of ET-1. To date, no alternative strategies, such as inhibitors of ET converting enzymes or combined endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE)/neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitors, have been approved. Four compounds, bosentan, ambrisentan, sitaxentan, and macitentan, originally were approved for clinical use in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) ([Table 2](#t0010){ref-type="table"}).[@bib11] Sitaxentan, however, was withdrawn from clinical use in 2010[@bib58] after idiosyncratic hepatitis occurred resulting from acute liver failure, leading to death. PAH affects approximately 100,000 patients in the United States and Europe and currently there is no cure. The disease is characterized by constriction and remodeling of pulmonary vessels, with high blood pressure in the lungs. This leads to right heart failure, which is the ultimate cause of death. Interestingly, although ET~A~ are increased significantly in the failing right ventricle of patients with PAH[@bib59] and the failing left ventricle of patients with heart failure,[@bib60] clinical trails have failed to show a benefit in patients from the latter group.[@bib12] The reasons for this are unclear, but the action of ET antagonists on the vasculature may be more important in restoring the imbalance between ET-induced constriction and opposing vasodilatation of blood vessels.

In theory, the selectivity of antagonists should have pharmacologic and pathophysiological consequences. Selectively blocking smooth muscle ET~A~ would be expected to lead to vasodilatation and attenuate proliferation, migration, fibrosis, and hypertrophy. Endothelial ET~B~, particularly in kidney, lung, and liver, should continue to bind and remove ET-1 where it is overexpressed in pathophysiological conditions, as well as releasing vasodilators to mediate their antiproliferative and antithrombotic actions.

How do we Define Antagonist-Receptor Selectivity? {#s0050}
=================================================

These four antagonists represent a spectrum of selectivity ranging from bosentan, which is classified by the pharmaceutical company Actelion (Allschwil, Switzerland) as a mixed or balanced ET~A~/ET~B~ antagonist, to sitaxentan, the most ET~A~

Previous research has shown that people can be exposed to EDCs in house dust.[@c2] "People spend the majority of their time indoors, and I think we have this sense that we're more protected from these contaminant exposures indoors than we are outdoors," says Heather Stapleton, an associate professor at the Nicholas School of the Environment, Duke University, who was not involved in the new study. "But that's actually not the case, because if you analyze house dust for contaminants, there \[are\] so many different chemicals in there," she says. These dust-borne EDCs can enter the body through inhalation, ingestion, or dermal absorption.[@c2]

The current study was part of a larger Swedish project on EDCs known as Mixture aSSessments of EDCs (MiSEE; <https://www.aces.su.se/misse/>). The researchers selected 25 compounds that are known to bind to TTR and have previously been identified in house dust, maternal serum, and infant serum or cord blood. They created mixtures representing the median concentrations of the compounds identified in each of these media. They also produced an extract from Standard Reference Material (SRM) 2585, a stock mixture of organic contaminants in a dust matrix.

The researchers used *in vitro* assays to determine the extent to which individual compounds, the reconstituted mixtures, and the SRM2585-based extract altered $T_{4}$ binding to TTR. These assays revealed that the measured overall $T_{4}$-displacing effect of each mixture was well predicted by adding up the contributions of the constituents relative to their individual TTR-binding potencies and concentrations.

Next, they extrapolated this information to estimate the inhibition that might occur *in vivo*, an even more complicated setting due to the presence of other $T_{4}$ carriers. Overall, the contaminant mixtures led to an estimated 1.3--1.5% inhibition of $T_{4}$ binding to TTR *in vivo*. Given that TTR binding accounts for only 3--4% of the total $T_{4}$ in pregnant women and infants, the absolute amount of displaced $T_{4}$ was quite small. Nevertheless, TTR has an outsized role in the precise delivery of $T_{4}$ at target sites. For women who already have compromised thyroid status (e.g., hypothyroxinemia or hypothyroidism), any disruption could be relevant for the developing fetus

We explored areas with non-analogous (novel) climatic conditions between present-day climate in the calibration regions vs. future climate in the projection region of Minnesota. This resulted in a present vs. future comparison and calibration vs. projection regions. This analysis was done using the extrapolation detection (Exdet) tool developed by Mesgaran et al. \[[@pone.0180930.ref034]\]. Exdet identifies non-analogous environments between calibration and projection regions denoted as type I novelty \[*sensu* 34\]. Accounting for these non-analogous or novel environments enables a more confident interpretation of models \[[@pone.0180930.ref018],[@pone.0180930.ref035],[@pone.0180930.ref036]\].

Ecological niche models {#sec007}
-----------------------

Qiao et al. \[[@pone.0180930.ref037]\] proposed that multiple ecological niche modeling algorithms should be employed to identify the model that best fits with the available data, the study system, and the research question. We used Maxent to perform niche modeling because it enables the use of different variable transformations (features), i.e., linear (L), quadratic (Q), product (P), threshold (T), and hinge (H), and allows for different parameterizations (regularization values). In addition, Maxent allows automatic truncation in novel climates to avoid predictions in non-analogous environments.

Maxent is an occurrences-background algorithm, which estimates the most uniform probable distribution of the occurrences across a selected calibration region \[[@pone.0180930.ref013],[@pone.0180930.ref038]\]. The background represents the summary of environmental conditions across the model calibration region. Because we explored two calibration regions (invaded range and two areas from the entire species' range) the available background varied. We developed models based on 5,000 and also 10,000 background samples.

Here, we tested 20 different regularization coefficient values ranging from 0.1 to 2. The regularization coefficients regulate the complexity of the model, higher values penalize for complexity and thus, produce simpler models (avoiding complex relationships between the data and the variables) that, in general, tend to have larger predictions \[[@pone.0180930.ref039]\]. Because assessing different configurations is recommended \[[@pone.0180930.ref039]--[@pone.0180930.ref041]\], we explored models based on six feature combinations reported in the literature: L, LQ, H

Alcian blue at pH 2.5 cytochemical staining for glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

LS174T cells were grown for 24 h on glass coverslip. The day after the medium was removed and cells fixed in 3.7% Paraformaldehyde. Then the cells were incubated in Acetic Acid Solution (3%) for 3 min and next with Alcian Blue (pH 2.5) solution for 30 min at room temperature. Following the treatment, the cells were washed in Acetic acid solution to remove Alcian Blue excess and then in water. The coverslips were mounted on glass slides for microscopy examination. Cells were analyzed with an optical microscope (20x).

Periodic acid-Schiff\'s staining for glycoprotein bands
-------------------------------------------------------

The supernatants of LS174Tcells, grown in absence and in presence of quercetin (50 μM), were loaded onto the BIO-Dot SF as previously described. Next the membranes were placed in 5% non-fat milk in tris buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST, Bio-Rad Laboratories) at room temperature overnight to block the non-specific binding sites. Filters were incubated in 1% periodic acid for 15 min, rinsed with distilled water and stained with Schiff\'s reagent for up to 60 min at room temperature. Glycoprotein bands were quantified by densitometry using ImageJ software.

Quercetin increases MUC2 and MUC5AC secretion and mRNA levels
-------------------------------------------------------------

Since LS174T cells produce large amount of secretory mucins released in the extracellular space (Van Klinken et al., [@B28]) we used these cells to study the effects of quercetin on mucin secretion. These cells are similar to intestinal goblet cells since they contain intracellular muc

PCa is the leading cause of cancer-related incidences and 2^nd^ leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Increasingly, we have succeeded in early diagnosis of the disease localized mostly at the PIN stage; however, this has not translated into reducing PCa morbidity and mortality. Newly diagnosed PCa patient are mostly kept on watchful waiting and monitored for years as the potential challenges with the treatment exceeds the benefits. These PCa patient populations could be ideal for chemopreventive approaches, as such agents are generally non-toxic, orally bioavailable, and have broad efficacy. However, the main challenges in PCa chemoprevention approaches are reliable biomarkers for predicting the course of disease, as well as, the efficacy of the chemopreventive agents.

Accumulating evidences clearly indicates that NOX activity could affect several of the hallmarks of cancer, including genomic instability, growth, survival, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis[@b2][@b3][@b5][@b7][@b10]. There are abundant reports suggesting that the NOX system plays an important role in PCa growth and progression[@b2][@b3][@b4][@b5][@b8][@b30]. In a pioneer study, Arbiser *et al.* showed that ectopic expression of NOX1 in PCa cells promoted their growth, tumorigenicity and angiogenicity[@b5]. Lim *et al.* reported that NOX1 is overexpressed in a high percentage of human prostate tumors associated with elevated ROS generation[@b4]. That study also reported that increased NOX protein correlated with enhanced tumor and metastatic potential of PCa cells[@b4]. Similarly, NOX5 down-regulation caused growth arrest and apoptosis in PCa cells[@b30]. Another study by Kumar *et al.* clearly established that NOX-mediated oxidative stress determines PCa aggressiveness[@b2]. Importantly, NOX (1, 2 and 4) expression is significantly up-regulated in rat ventral prostate following castration[@b6]. In the present study, we identified that NOX1 and p67^phox^ expression is associated with PCa progression in TRAMP mice. Together, these studies provide a strong support towards the development of non-toxic NOX inhibitors in the prevention and treatment of PCa.

Experiment 1: Identification of Rhythmic Transformations
========================================================

This experiment tested whether spatially mapped notations of inter-onset interval (IOI) patterns facilitated the identification of rhythmic transformations compared to western notation. Pairs of novel rhythms were presented and participants were asked to identify whether a transformation had been applied to the second rhythm in the stimulus pair. IOI patterns can only be transformed by reflecting their temporal order or shifting their phase, making chance performance high in a forced choice paradigm. Therefore the discrimination trials were included in the design to provide four alternate responses for each trial. To compare the efficacy of the two notation types, novice musicians were pseudo-randomly assigned to a western or graphic notation condition, keeping age and gender approximately equal.

Methods
-------

### Participants

Twenty-eight participants took part in the experiment (see [Results](#s1){ref-type="sec"} for demographic details). All participants considered themselves novice musicians. Four participants were recruited from the wider community and 24 were first year psychology students at The University of Melbourne who received course credit for participation. All were screened for music experience and music reading ability before assignment to one of the notation conditions. Seven participants understood written music but rated themselves as "not proficient" music readers and were evenly distributed between the groups. No participants reported experience with digital music systems such as musical instrument digital interface (MIDI) sequencers.

### Stimuli

Ecologically valid rhythms were created according to the criterion of Pressing ([@B48]) of approximately 50% density of accents to rests (that is, 50% of the musical beats are played). It was also important to prevent stimuli from being biased by properties of the notations themselves. For example, western rhythms have symbols that denote the iterative halving of beat durations whereas additional text denotes the division of beats into thirds (Figure [1](#F1){ref-type="fig"}), potentially facilitating rhythmic processing of phrases divisible by two. This problem was addressed by first generating a set of all possible IOI patterns (where accents and rests were denoted by a binary code for each beat). A computer program then selected plausible rhythmic stimuli according to the set of culturally non-specific criteria detailed in Table [1](#T1){ref-type="table"}. A second set of criteria, detailed in

Background {#Sec1}
==========

Lymphangiomas are benign neoplasms regarded as congenital malformations of the lymphatic system (Stavropoulos et al. [@CR17]). Most lymphangiomas are located in the head, neck, and axilla, where the loose connective tissue allows for easy expansion of lymphatic channels. Intraabdominal cases account for less than 5% of all lymphangiomas (Losanoff et al. [@CR12]). Hepatic Lymphangiomas are characterized by cystic dilatation of the lymphatic vessels in the hepatic parenchyma usually observed in children and adolescents (Bertino et al. [@CR5]; Asch et al. [@CR2]; Zhang et al. [@CR20]). In most cases, the hepatic lesion is usually part of multi-organ involvement including the spleen, kidney, skeleton, gastrointestinal tract, mesentery, lung, pleura, pericardium and other tissues (Stavropoulos et al. [@CR17]; Koh & Sheu [@CR10]). A solitary hepatic lymphangioma in an adult is extremely rare and lack of specific clinical symptoms, therefore, it is easy to be misdiagnosed. The aim of this report is to introducing the experience in managing an adult with a giant liver cystic lymphangioma.

A 41-year-old male with a 6-month history of left upper abdominal pain visited our department. A large, palpable soft mass 8 cm below the left costal margin was found.

Hematology and biochemistry results were normal while Hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) and Hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) were positive. Results of kidney function, electrolytes, and all tumor markers related to the liver were negative. Brain computed tomography (CT) scan and chest X-ray did not find other lesions in the patient.Abdominal ultrasound (US) showed a giant mixed-echoic mass (15 cm × 10 cm) with a pedunculatedextrahepatic growth pattern. An enhanced abdominal CT scan confirmed a giant cystic hepatic lesion with no capsule. The lesion was demonstrated with a heterogeneous enhancement in the arterial phase (Figure [1](#Fig1){ref-type="fig"}). The laboratory and image findings were not sufficient to differentiate the benign or malignant nature of the mass.Figure 1**Contrast-enhanced CT scan shows heterogeneous enhancement of the giant cystic lesion.

A medical examination was performed before the study began in order to verify that the participants did not have any disease. In addition, no rower was taking medications that affected body mass, or any supplement or medication that affected analytical or performance values. The experimental procedures, associated risks, and benefits were explained prior to the medical examination, so each rower signed a written consent form prior to commencing study participation. None of the rowers had pre-existing injuries before or during the intervention period. This study was designed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (2008) and Fortaleza update (2013) and approved by the ethics committee of the University of Basque Country (M10_2017_247).

2.2. Experimental Protocol and Evaluation Program {#sec2dot2-nutrients-10-01968}
-------------------------------------------------

This study was structured with a double-blind, placebo-controlled design in order to analyze the effects of and 8-week oral supplementation of 3000 IU per day of vitamin D3 (Lindens Health + Nutrition Ltd., Wakefield, WF2) on the hematological, iron metabolism, and muscle recovery studied by catabolic--anabolic hormones. Participants were assigned to groups using a stratified block design. An independent statistician generated the random allocation sequence: 1) Control group (CG, *n* = 18, height: 181.05 ± 3.39 cm and body mass: 77.02 ± 7.55 kg), 2) Group treated with 3000 IU/day of vitamin D3 (VD3G, *n* = 18, height: 179.70 ± 9.07 cm and body mass: 76.19 ± 10.07 kg).

All participants attended the laboratory (08:30) for blood collection at two specific points during the study: 1) at baseline (T1), and 2) post-treatment (T2---the day after 8 weeks of treatment). The VD3G took 3000 IU of vitamin D3 with one capsule per day. While in the GC, the rowers assigned took capsules of similar external appearance filled with 10 mg of maltodextrin. Both groups took their dose every morning with their breakfast from the day following T1 to T2 (during 8 weeks). The control group served as baseline or "standard" condition because this group did not take any vitamin D3.

Discussion
==========

The osteogenic activity is mediated by multiple proteins and may be altered by different circumstances. We investigated whether genes associated with this activity may have a different expression in bone tissue of osteoporotic fracture patients versus osteoarthritis patients. We have studied 86 genes related to osteogenic activity and 84 to apoptosis. Most of them have a lower expression in osteoporotic bone than in osteoarthritic bone, indicating that the bone tissue in osteoporosis is more inert, having less transcriptional activity.

Regarding osteogenic activity, the macerated OP hip bone has repressed typical genes of osteoblast cell. So BGLAP (essential for bone mineralization), CDH11 (osteoblast adhesion molecule) and Runx2 (transcription factor required for osteoblastogenesis), have a lower expression in osteoporotic than arthritic bone, which is consistent with decreased osteoblast differentiation and activity in osteoporosis bone. This finding agrees with previous results \[[@B12],[@B13]\], and low levels of osteocalcin published by Napal et al. in stressful situation \[[@B14]\]. These results were confirmed by the analysis of the expression of Runx-2 by real-time PCR, significantly lower in samples from OP patients, in comparison with samples from OA patients.

Several TGF-β/BMP signalling pathway components and modulator genes that influence osteoblast function, bone remodelling and bone mineralization, were down-regulated in OP bone, such as TGFBR1, TGFBR2, BMP5, BMP6, SMAD 2 and SMAD3. Several authors agree with these results, and it is consistent with decreased in the bone turnover in OP bone \[[@B15]-[@B18]\].

Previous studies demonstrated that BMP6 was more potent and consistent than BMP2 and BMP7 in inducing osteoblast differentiation in primary hMSC \[[@B19]\], so that a decrease in the expression of BMP6 in OP bone indicates a minor osteoblast differentiation. In the other hand, BMP5 accelerates expression of hypertrophy markers which is of relevance in both development and diseases such as osteoarthritis \[[@B20]\], this is consistent with the presence of higher values

To better understand OPA1 function, we purified recombinant OPA1 and developed assays to study its GTP hydrolysis activity and association with lipids. In addition, we studied whether these activities were perturbed by mutations in OPA1 that cause DOA. Our results show that several OPA1 activities---including lipid association, GTP hydrolysis and membrane tubulation---are disrupted in DOA disease alleles.

Cardiolipin enhances GTPase hydrolysis by OPA1 {#s2a}
----------------------------------------------

To study the biophysical properties of OPA1, we expressed the short isoform of human OPA1 (splice form 1; termed hereafter as OPA1-S1) with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag in bacteria. Recombinant OPA1-S1 is highly soluble in 300 m[m]{.smallcaps} NaCl (Fig. [1](#DDQ088F1){ref-type="fig"}A) but shows low GTP hydrolysis activity, with a turnover number of 0.06 GTP/min (Fig. [1](#DDQ088F1){ref-type="fig"}B). As the concentration of NaCl is reduced, OPA1-S1 shows a modest increase in GTP hydrolysis activity, reaching a maximum turnover number of 0.6 GTP/min at 0 m[m]{.smallcaps} salt (Fig. [1](#DDQ088F1){ref-type="fig"}B). No GTP hydrolysis activity was detected with OPA1-S1 containing the mutation G300E in the G1 motif of the GTPase domain, indicating that the low levels of GTP hydrolysis detected are authentic. Concomitant with the 10-fold increase in GTPase activity with decreasing salt, we found OPA1-S1 could be progressively sedimented by a high-speed spin (100 000*g*). Whereas little OPA1-S1 is sedimented at 300 m[m]{.smallcaps} NaCl, OPA1-S1 was found almost entirely in the pellet fraction at 50 and 0 m[m]{.smallcaps} salt (Fig. [1](#DDQ088F1){ref-type="fig"}A). We examined OPA1 under various salt conditions by negative staining electron microscopy and found that the protein aggregates induced under low salt had no specific or ordered morphology ([Supplementary Material, Fig. S1A](http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full

The IRECI and CDL databases were compared using simple linear regressions. The areas occupied by crops (IRECI index) in each ring for each year were compared with the areas of soybean and corn crops for 2017 and 2018 (CDL database). The results show a high correlation (statistically significant at *p* \< 0.0001) between the base determined by the IRECI index (crops) and that of CDL in both years, the *r*^*2*^ for 2017 is 0.98 for (slope 1.12) and for 2018 is 0.97 (slope 1,15).

3.2. CPI calculation {#sec3.2}

### 3.2.1. Argentine study area {#sec3.2.1}

After processing peri-urban land use data using [Eq. (2)](#fd2){ref-type="disp-formula"}, the values of each factor were determined. [Table 3](#tbl3){ref-type="table"} shows this information for each city, which was needed to calculate [Eq. (1)](#fd1){ref-type="disp-formula"}. The crop data (IRECI index) are disaggregated for 2016, 2017 and 2018. In addition, this table shows the CPI indices for each year, as well as the average for these three years. The values of the CPI index are relativized with respect to the theoretical locality 1, so they vary from 1 to -1.Table 3**CPI data and results for the Argentine study area.** The data for each factor obtained using [Eq.

Titanium (Ti) implants have been widely applied as bone substitutes, orthopedic and dental implants, as well as many other biomedical appliances due to their good mechanical property, excellent biocompatibility and unique osseointegration capacity[@b1]. A high 10-year survival rate of about 95% has been achieved for the Ti based bone implants in healthy patients[@b2]. However, they still suffer from deficient bioactivity that may lead to implant failure, especially when encountering some complicated conditions that do not favor the osseointegration establishment. For example, osteoporosis, one of the major public health problems around the world characterized by excessive bone loss and low bone formation[@b3], can severely compromise the primary stability and osseointegration establishment of Ti implant[@b4]. Then specifically designed Ti implant with sufficient osseointegration establishing ability in the osteoporotic condition is urgently in need. To that end, biofunctionalization represents a promising approach[@b5][@b6].

Currently, biofunctionalization of biomaterials has been mainly conducted with extracellular matrix components, growth factors, peptides, etc., which do not directly touch the molecular mechanism underlying the osteoporosis occurrence and development thereby generating limited biological effect[@b6]. Biofunctionalization to target the key molecular events in osteoporosis shall more robustly improve the osseointegration in the osteoporotic condition. It is found that some negative bone turnover modulators play key roles in the osteoporosis occurrence and development thanks to the development in the molecular mechanism study of osteoporosis. Meanwhile, short interfering RNA (siRNA, siR) delivery, a highly efficient and specific gene silencing technology, has been greatly advanced, which is considered to be a promising approach for the treatment of various diseases[@b7]. Then it is feasible to develop the siRNA biofunctionalized Ti implant targeting the negative bone turnover modulator involved in osteoporosis for enhanced osseointegration in the osteoporotic condition. For example, casein kinase-2 interacting protein-1 (Ckip-1) is found to be involved in osteoporosis by negatively regulating the bone turnover via specifically upgrading the E3 ligase activity of Smurf1[@b8]. The Ckip-1 knockdown by siRNA notably increases the bone mass and enhances structure of trabecular bone in both healthy and osteoporotic rats[@b9][@b10]. Thus, Ckip-1 siRNA (siCkip-1) is a good candidate for the implant biofunctionalization.

Though there are spgeveral reports on the siRNA biofunctionalization

### Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab

Atezolizumab targets PD-L1 ([@b56-ol-0-0-11909]). A phase IB clinical study of atezolizumab combined with bevacizumab for the treatment of advanced HCC, the GO30140 study (NCT02715531) ([@b56-ol-0-0-11909]), was reported at the ASCO conference in 2018. In 23 assessable patients, the ORR was 65% and the DCR was 95%.

In November 2019, the IMbrave 150 study, a global multi-center and open-label phase III trial that enrolled 501 patients with unresectable HCC who did not receive systemic therapies, was reported at the ESMO Asian conference (Abstract: LBA3) ([@b57-ol-0-0-11909]). The patients were randomly administered atezolizumab combined with bevacizumab or sorafenib at a 2:1 ratio until unacceptable toxicity or no further clinical benefits were observed. The latest results showed that the median PFS time in the atezolizumab group was 6.8 months (range, 5.7--8.3 months), while that of the sorafenib group was 4.3 months (range, 4.0--5.6 months).

At the Liver Cancer Summit 2020, which is organized by the European Association for the Study of the Liver, Qin *et al* presented the Chinese subgroup results of the IMbrave trial, which confirmed the previous global results ([@b58-ol-0-0-11909]). Among 194 Chinese patients who had poorer prognostic factors compared with the global data, 133 patients were randomly assigned to the combination group (atezolizumab plus bevacizumab) and 61 to the sorafenib group. The median follow-up time of the combined group and the sorafenib group was 7.2 and 5.6 months, respectively. The mPFS was 5.7 vs. 3.2 months, and the ORR was 25 vs. 7%, which was consistent with the global results. Moreover, the incidence of toxicity was relatively low.

### Pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib

In the REFLECT study, which aimed to compare the efficacy of lenvatinib and sorafenib in unresectable patients with advanced HCC, lenvatinib was shown not to be inferior to sorafenib; therefore, lenvatinib was approved as a

a-SMN and FL-SMN silencing induces "multi-neuritic" neurons display mixed axonal/dendritic phenotype {#sec015}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to a reduced axonal growth, the silencing of FL-SMN and a-SMN resulted in the existence of numerous neurons displaying what we called a \"multi-neuritic morphology\", meaning neurons with multiple long neurites (longer than 40 μm) ([Fig 6A~2~--6B~2~ and 6A~3~--6B~3~](#pone.0199105.g006){ref-type="fig"}) rather than the classical phenotype of one long neurite and several short ones ([Fig 6A~1~--6B~1~](#pone.0199105.g006){ref-type="fig"}). In particular, morphometric analysis ([Fig 6C](#pone.0199105.g006){ref-type="fig"}) revealed that approximately 25% of neurons with reduced a-SMN (25.53% ± 3.40% of Venus^+^ neurons) displayed such abnormality, whereas less than 16% were observed in FL-SMN knockdown (15.91% ± 1.3% of Venus^+^ neurons). By contrast, only a small percentage of the neurons treated with non-targeting siRNA showed a "multi-neuritic" morphology (3,1% ± 1,29% of Venus^+^ neurons).

#### Bioassays for Binding and Cross-linking of Extracellular Domains of VEGFR-2 or VEGFR-3

Bioassays employed cell lines expressing chimeric receptors consisting of the entire extracellular domain of mouse VEGFR-2 or human VEGFR-3 and the trans-membrane and cytoplasmic domains of the mouse erythropoietin receptor ([@B25], [@B63]). Binding and cross-linking of the chimeric receptors allows these cells to survive and proliferate in the absence of IL-3. Bioassays with VEGF-C and VEGF-D variants were conducted as described previously ([@B25], [@B64]) except that the ligand concentration was 200 ng/ml (unless specified otherwise), and DNA synthesis or proliferation of cells was monitored using \[^3^H\]thymidine ([@B65]), a ViaLight Plus kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland), or Presto Blue^TM^ cell viability reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers\' protocols. For some assays, mAbs VD1 and VD4 were included as controls.

#### Receptor Phosphorylation Assays

Phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 on adult LECs (AdLECs, Lonza) treated with VEGF-C or VEGF-D variants at 200 ng/ml was analyzed as described previously ([@B62]).

#### Quantitative RT-PCR to Analyze COX-2 mRNA

AdLECs were serum-starved overnight and then exposed to VEGF-C or VEGF-D variants (at 100 ng/ml, unless stated otherwise) before isolation of total RNA using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and preparation of cDNA with a high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) using 1 μg of total RNA. Quantitation of cDNA for COX-2 and the internal reference gene (β-actin) was carried out with TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix using an Applied Biosystems 7500 fast real-time PCR machine (both from Thermo Fisher Scientific). TaqMan gene expression assays for COX-2 (HS00153133-M1) and β-actin (HS99999903-M1) were from Applied Biosystems (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each reaction was done in triplicate, and all samples were analyzed using StepOne^TM^ Software version 2.2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Quantitation of COX-2 mRNA after treatment of cells with growth

In a large retrospective longitudinal study, relying on a multilevel model and accounting for both within-subject and between-subject variation, symptomatic outcomes were associated with serum FT3 concentrations, and differed according to the placement of biochemical parameters within the reference range or noticeably beyond its limits in the case of TSH and FT4 \[[@CR50]\]. Treatment-related displacement of the equilibria between thyroid parameters, wide variations in the biochemical treatment response, and individually adjusted dose requirement pose particular challenges for thyroid trials \[[@CR27], [@CR45], [@CR59], [@CR60]\]. Demonstration of averaged equivalency cannot therefore be a satisfactory analytical goal \[[@CR61]\].

Accordingly, the value of statistical evidence derived from historical meta-analyses \[[@CR62]--[@CR66]\] and RCTs on the acceptability of T3/T4 combination therapy is severely weakened and requires careful reconsideration \[[@CR60]\]. Many RCTs were conducted with inferior quality of life instruments available at the time and relied on statistical techniques both less suited for highly individual parameters and in addition susceptible to Simpson's paradox. Using the overall preference expressed by patients at the end of double-blind studies as a proxy, patients mostly favoured T3/T4 combination therapy \[[@CR52]\]. A thyroid-specific QoL has only recently been developed and validated \[[@CR51]\]. Simpson's paradox (also known as amalgamation bias or collider stratification bias) may explain, at least in part, why otherwise well-performed studies failed to provide a convincing relationship between symptoms and thyroid function tests \[[@CR27], [@CR54], [@CR59]--[@CR61]\]. The paradox is a relevant factor for the relationship of patient complaints, biochemical markers and treatment response to LT4 \[[@CR60]\]. This bias - unless properly accounted for statistically - dissociates the personal treatment responses from the statistical group effect, thereby masking individual treatment success or failure in an unchanged grouped outcome. A lack of group to individual generalizability has been increasingly recognized in other fields, requiring explicit testing for equivalence of processes both at the individual and group level \[[@CR61]\].

Trials purporting to relate TSH and thyroid hormone levels to the incidence of osteoporosis and atrial fibrillation fall under the same fundamental caveats \[[@CR24], [@CR27]\]. In particular, the Rotterdam study has shown that within the euthyroid range the prognostic implications of thyroid hormones and TSH differ, and, that TSH measurements therefore cannot substitute for FT4 concentrations in predicting the risk of atrial fibrillation \[[@CR67]\].

A 69-year-old woman without medical history was bitten on the back of the left foot  by a scorpion of the genius Tityus trivitatus ([Figure 1](#F1){ref-type="fig"}) Initially, she present mild local pain and erythematous reaction and was treated with dexamethasone, diphenhydramine and then she was transferred to our hospital. At emergency admission she was tachycardic (HR 157 bpm) in sinus rhythm, tachypneic (RR 42 bpm), hypertensive (187/97 mmHg), hypothermic (35.5ºC rectal temperature), sweaty, with increased respiratory secretions and excessive tearing and salivation. She showed progressive deterioration of consciousness state to coma (Glasgow 7 points: O1, V1, M5), localizing nociceptive stimuli in both arms and legs. Pupils remained equal and reactive.

No meningeal irritation was detected. She was intubated, ventilated, oxygenated and resuscitated with isotonic fluids, corticosteroids and anti-scorpion polyvalent serum (4 units). Deep sedoanalgesia was started with remifentanil and propofol (RASS -- 4) \[7\]. EKG showed sinus tachycardia with isolated monofocal ventricular extra systoles. X-ray of the chest was normal.

The number of identified homologous mapped markers (actual plus virtual) between the species pairs human-cat, human-cow and cat-mouse and cat-cow, was 551, 633, 470 and 311, respectively.

Results
=======

Human-mouse-cat dataset
-----------------------

The genomic maps of homologous markers were first compared between human, mouse and cat using the MGR and GRIMM-synteny algorithms. The comparison involved 470 Type 1 coding gene markers with MGR distance threshold parameters set at G = 4, 5, 6, 8 and 20 (Table [1](#T1){ref-type="table"}). The results reveal several important patterns that can be interpreted in a comparative genomics context. First, increasing the distance threshold typically results in an increase in the number of markers returned in clusters, as fewer singletons are dropped. Another consequence of the threshold increase is that the number of clusters typically decreases, as does the overall rearrangement distance. This is the result of reducing the number of local rearrangements due to poor mapping resolution of tightly linked markers, or derived micro-rearrangements, in the mouse genome. At very high thresholds (eg *G*= 20), almost all internal inversions are not counted, in many cases collapsing entire chromosomes into single conserved segments. We show results at high thresholds only to demonstrate the failure to resolve chromosome associations (see below) with a few diagnostic markers, while enhancing recovery of single chromosome syntenies (Table [2](#T2){ref-type="table"}). In practice, however, we do not advocate using such high thresholds, as they result in loss of almost all intrachromosomal detail. A chromosome association is defined as clusters of two different human chromosomes that are adjacent on a single chromosome in another genome (ie fragments of human chromosomes 14 and 15 fused together (denoted 14/15) on cat chromosome B3) or in an ancestor.

5.1. The Most Important Factors in Gully Modelling by IGR {#sec5dot1-sensors-19-02444}
---------------------------------------------------------

The predictive average merit of gully erosion affecting factors by the IGR method is shown in [Figure 4](#sensors-19-02444-f004){ref-type="fig"}. Factor selection results showed that 19 out of 22 conditioning factors were capable of modeling gully erosion prediction (AM \> 0). Distance to river has the highest average merit for gully modeling (AM = 0.283). It is because most gullies in the study area were located beside the river networks. It is followed by geomorphology (AM = 0.147), land use (AM = 0.134), HG (AM = 0.134), lithology (AM = 0.076), slope (AM = 0.053), STI (AM = 0.052), SPI (AM = 0.051), river density (AM = 0.046), rainfall (AM = 0.045), elevation (AM = 0.036), road density (AM = 0.032), TWI (AM = 0.03), permeability (AM = 0.026), aspect (AM = 0.024), distance to road (AM = 0.019), profile curvature (AM = 0.008) and flow accumulation (AM = 0.007).

5.2. Gully Modeling Procedure or Optimization {#sec5dot2-sensors-19-02444}
---------------------------------------------

In the modeling process, the determination of optimum parameters values in all algorithms is a critical issue for achieving an algorithm with the highest goodness-of-fit and performance. The optimum parameters of the investigated models are shown in [Table 2](#sensors-19-02444-t002){ref-type="table"}. Basically, the new hybrid RF-ADTree and soft computing benchmark models (NBMU, SVM-Polynomial, SVM-RBF, and LR) were built using 19 conditioning factors and training dataset for the spatial prediction of gullies. In this study, the optimum number of seed (from 1 to 10) and iteration (from 10 to 20 iterations) was obtained with various numbers of iterations and seeds versus AUC and RMSE for the training and validation of datasets under a trial and error procedure.

The results of optimum value selection for the number of seeds are shown in [Figure 5](#sensors-19-02444-f005

Phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the neighbor-joining ([@B21]) algorithm with 1,000 bootstrap replicates in the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) X software ([@B22]). The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method ([@B23]) and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. The sequences of all the reference strains used were obtained from the GenBank database ([Tables 3A](#T3){ref-type="table"}--[D](#T6){ref-type="table"}).

Integrated databases share data across multiple data types ranging from clinical to 'omics and medical imaging relative to specific research area. In Table [2](#Tab2){ref-type="table"}, we provide a list of discipline-specific databases covering oncological, neurological, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular field or multiple-diseases. So far, multi-omic profiles are primarily available in the oncological field. Indeed, Genomic Data Commons (GDC) portal, which includes the TCGA database, and TCIA are an unprecedented source of biomedical data for a broad range of cancer diseases. Although each database possesses its own organization, overall, they store data sets with multiple data types available at different levels. In addition to multi-omic and imaging data, supporting data related to the images such as patient outcomes, treatment details, genomics, pathology, and expert analyses are also provided when available. Clinical, multi-omic and pathological data stored on the GDC can be associated to the imaging data, stored on TCIA. Although both data portals allow an interactive navigation through different projects and their multiple data types, using matched TCGA patient identifiers, it is possible to explore the TCGA/TCIA databases without the ability to automatically correlate tissue genotype, radiological phenotype and patient outcomes. For example, many TCGA/TCIA studies \[[@CR70]--[@CR72]\] have published their radiomic data (radiomic features, radiologist features or also segmentations) on the TCIA website. These data are in a simple table format, such as xls format, and at present there is no way to automatically explore the radiomic data together with the genome data available on TCGA portal. The current workflow consists of downloading imaging and genomic features separately, integrating the data through a non standard way and finally performing a cleaning and subsetting operation. The results of this process are likely to result in a situation in which there is either little or no suitable omic data. Thus, there is an urgent need to link radiomic and genomic data globally such that data integration in achieved, facilitating scientists to uncover genotype--phenotype associations/correlations. In the following section, we provide a case study based on breast cancer data from TCGA/TCIA database to illustrate an example of data integration and utilization of MAE data structure for multi-omics data management.Table 2Integrated Database of oncological, neurological/neurodegenerative, cardiovascular and multiple diseasesNameDescriptionData typeData accessData downloadLatest updateOncological disease CPT

LaKS400 was cultivated in 10 mL MRS broth (VWR, Spain) pH 6.5 for 24 h at 37 °C in the presence of 10% CO~2~. After incubation, the cell culture was heated at 70 °C for 30 min to assure inhibition of protease activity, then cooled at room temperature and centrifuged (4500 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C) with a benchtop centrifuge (Heraeus megafuge 8R centrifuge, Thermo-fisher Scientific, EUA). In order to eliminate the antimicrobial effect of organic acids, the pH of the supernatants was adjusted to 6.5 with 10 M NaOH solution. The inhibitory activity from hydrogen peroxide was eliminated by the addition of 5 mg/mL catalase from bovine liver (Sigma-Aldrich, EUA) followed by filtration through a 0.2 µm pore-size cellulose acetate (Fisher-Scientific, UK).

Bacteriocin detection was performed by using a modification of the antagonist well-diffusion method described by Tagg and McGiven ([@CR40]): briefly, 20 mL of MRS soft agar was inoculated with 200 µl of the indicator microorganism (*Lactobacillus delbrueckii* ATCC9649) in an overnight culture. Wells with 4 mm diameter were punched in agar plates and filled with 100 µl of cell-free culture supernatants. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used as negative control. The plates were maintained at room temperature for 3 h to allow for bacteriocin diffusion, followed by incubation at 37 °C in the presence of 10% CO~2~, during 24--48 h. The bacteriocin activity was determined by macroscopic observation of a clear inhibition zone on the agar.

To study the bacteriocin production kinetics, 500 mL of MRS broth at pH 6.5 were inoculated with *La*KS400 strain (1% v/v) and incubated at 37 °C in the presence of gaseous nitrogen without agitation. At every hour during fermentation, both bacterial cell density and the culture medium pH were measured. Every 2 h we proceeded to the evaluation of antimicrobial activity against the indicator strain (*Lactobacillus delbrueckii* ATCC9649) as described above.

In conclusion, the stronger effects of high-dose *in ovo* administration of L-Leu caused hypothermia and a reduced plasma T~4~ level at hatching, as well as enhancing the daily thermoregulation process in neonatal chicks and affording thermotolerance. The present study clarified that food-intake regulation and lipid metabolism did not contribute to the L-Leu-mediated improvement in thermotolerance under short-term heat stress. A future study will reveal the biochemical and molecular mechanisms whereby L-Leu improves thermotolerance.

A total of 96 completed surveys were returned. 93.8% (90) of respondents were from outside of the United States. Responses spanned 22 countries and seven continents ([Fig. 1](#fig1){ref-type="fig"} ). 68.8% (66) of respondents were residents, and 31.3% (30) were faculty ([Fig. 2](#fig2){ref-type="fig"} ). 91.7% (88) reported all elective cases are cancelled. Of these, 86.4% (76) of respondents indicated all levels of residents are affected equally, with 8% (7) reporting junior resident-level cases are disproportionately affected.Fig. 1Survey respondents by continent. It is notable that the vast majority of respondents (93.8%) were from outside of the United States. The most highly represented regions were Europe and South America.Fig. 1Fig. 2Survey respondents by faculty or resident status.

Several respondents reported that they are being provided with video discussions of surgical cases or additional seminars. From a grand rounds and seminars perspective, 40.6% (39) reported that all seminars are cancelled completely, with another 41.7% (40) reporting that all such seminars are virtual-only.

With regards to simulation, 105 responses were received across 96 respondents. 71.43% (75) of responses indicated that simulation is useful for all residents and 5.71% (6) reported it is only useful for junior residents. 20.95% (22) of responses indicated that simulation is not possible at their institution. The top reason provided for simulation not being possible was lack of equipment or access. Of the responses indicating that simulation was not possible, 63.6% (14) were from South America, despite only 37.5% of respondents being from South America. 31.8% (7) of respondents reporting simulation was not possible were from Europe (comparable to the overall prevalence of European responders at 38.5%) and one was from Australia.

An emerging challenge is the need for otolaryngologists to be realloc

By crossing male *Hic‐5*^*F/F*^*/sCre*^*Y+*^ mice with female *Apoe*^*−/−*^ mice, *Apoe*^*−/−*^*Hic‐5*^*F/F*^*/sCre*^*Y+*^ mice were generated. The Ang II treatment was performed from day 55 after the tamoxifen injection ([Figure 3](#fig03){ref-type="fig"}A) using tamoxifen‐injected *Apoe*^*−/−*^ mice as a control. The successful SMC‐specific deletion of Hic‐5 in tamoxifen‐injected *Apoe*^*−/−*^*Hic‐5*^*F/F*^*/sCre*^*Y+*^ mice was confirmed with use of Western blotting assay of the aortic media after the Ang II treatment, which showed a 98% reduction in Hic‐5 protein levels after the tamoxifen treatment ([Figure 3](#fig03){ref-type="fig"}D). In contrast, Hic‐5 expression in the aortic media from *Apoe*^*−/−*^ mice was not affected by tamoxifen. Systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol levels were not significantly different between the 2 groups (Table[1](#tbl01){ref-type="table"}). Although total cholesterol levels were decreased after the tamoxifen treatment in *Apoe*^*−/−*^ mice, as previously reported,^[@b20]^ treatment of *Apoe*^*−/−*^ mice and tamoxifen‐injected *Apoe*^*−/−*^ mice with Ang II for 4 weeks induced AAA formation (13/15 and 5/7, respectively) and AAA rupture (6/15 and 3/7, respectively) to the same extent. However, in contrast to tamoxifen‐injected *Apoe*^*−/−*^, a marked reduction in AAA rupture (0/8), AAA formation (1/8), and maximal aortic diameter was observed in tamoxifen‐injected *Apoe*^*−/−*^*Hic‐5*^*F/F*^*/sCre*^*Y+*^ mice ([Figure 3](#fig03){ref-type="fig"}C, [3](#fig03){ref-type="fig"}E through [3](#fig03){ref-type="fig"}G). These results suggest that the loss of Hic‐5 expression in aortic VSMCs, but not other aortic wall cells, is crucial for Ang II--induced AAA formation.

We next examined the effects of Ang II on Hic‐5 expression in the aorta from *Apoe*^*

Chronic lung injury model {#Sec12}
-------------------------

Bacille de Calmette et Guérin (BCG, 6 × 10^6^/mouse) derived from *Mycobacterium bovis* (Tokyo 172 strain) (Japan BCG Laboratory. Tokyo, Japan) in isotonic sodium chloride solution was intratracheally administered via a cannula at a determinate amount (100 µl/mouse) to anesthetized mice (Fulton et al. [@CR10]; Tokairin et al. [@CR42]). Mice were sacrificed after 28 days from administration for the preparation of pathological samples and the isolation of total RNA from the lungs. In the pathological analyses, three digitized tissue images were randomly taken using a microscope system at the 10× magnification from all lobes of each mouse, and the total number of granulomas was counted.

Immunohistochemistry {#Sec13}
--------------------

Paraffin-embedded sections (3 μm thick) were cut and placed on glass slides. For detection of immunoglobulin (Ig), sections were incubated with antibodies to horseradish peroxidase-labeled mouse IgG (Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA) at 1:250 dilution. For detection of endoplasmic reticulum to nucleus signaling (Ern)-1, sections were incubated with antibodies to phosphorylated Ern1, also known as inositol-requiring enzyme-1a (IRE1a) (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA) at 1:1000 dilution, followed by horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA) at 1:200 dilution. Color development was performed using the DAKO Liquid DAB + Substrate Chromogen System (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Immunostaining of all sections was performed simultaneously, to avoid variation due to differences in staining conditions. Cell nuclei were stained with hematoxylin.

To evaluate the positivity of IgG and Ern1, intensities of IgG and Ern1 immunohistochemistry in each granuloma were scored according to the scoring system described in the previous literature with some modification (Serth et al. [@CR33]): 0, no staining at all; 1, staining in \<5 % of cells; 2, staining in 5--10 % of cells; 3, staining in 11--39 % of cells; 4, staining in \>40 % of cells. This assessment was performed in the twenty granulomas in each

2.3. Analysis of virome datasets {#sec2.3}
--------------------------------

The primary processing (quality control and trimming) of the metavirome datasets (paired reads of 2 × 300 bp) was performed using the R package "ShortReads" \[[@bib6]\]. The first (up to 15) and last (up to 30) nucleotides with low quality were removed. The sequences of less than 80 nucleotides were excluded from datasets.

Taxonomic identification of viral sequences was performed using the BLASTn algorithm \[[@bib7]\] against NCBI RefSeq viral complete genomes database (September 2018 release) \[[@bib8]\]. The BLASTn parameters used were as follows: cost to open a gap, two; cost to extend a gap, one; word size for word finder algorithm, twelve; penalty for a nucleotide mismatch, one; the reward for a nucleotide match, one. The sequence reads were considered 'identified' if they had a relative in the reference database with an e-value of ≤10^−5^ and bit score ≥50. The BLASTn analysis data were saved as a hit table. BLAST hits corresponding to the same viral genome subject ID were considered to belong to one virotype. Each subject ID from the BLASTn hit table was converted to a taxonomic annotation.

For the functional annotation of viral sequences, we used the local Blastx application \[[@bib7]\] and COG database \[[@bib9]\]. The BLASTx parameters used were as follows: cost to open a gap, six; cost to extend a gap, two; word size for word finder algorithm, six; e-value of ≤10^−5^ and bit score ≥50.

Rarefaction analysis was performed to assess the species richness in the samples \[[@bib10]\]. The Shannon, Simpson, ACE and Chao1 indices were calculated for assessing the diversity of viral communities \[[@bib11]\]. The reliability of the difference between two *B. bacillifera* viral communities was estimated using the chi-square test. Statistical calculations were performed using the R packages "vegan" \[[@bib12]\] and "pvclust" \[[@bib13]\].

Mean ± SD of the length of MFs and the mode of the length of MFs are shown in each column. The mode of each histogram is marked by an arrow. The numbers of MFs used for the histograms in A--D were 93, 172, 79, and 140, respectively. (E) Changes in the ratio of the total length of the MT-associated MFs to that of the MTs in PPBs during PPB formation. Cells were divided into four groups according to nuclear stages and PPB width: interphase (interphase cell without a PPB), prophase1 (prophase cell with a broad PPB whose width is ≥7 μm), prophase 2 (prophase cell with a narrow PPB whose width is \<7 μm), and late prophase (a late-prophase cell with a PPB). The extent of MFs associated with MTs was determined by measuring the total length of the MT-associated MFs to the total length of the MTs in each stage. Mean ± SD is shown in each group. Data points were calculated from three interphase, six prophase 1, four prophase 2, and six late-prophase tomograms.](1809fig5){#F5}

[Figure 5E](#F5){ref-type="fig"} highlights a different feature of the relationship between the MT-associated MFs and the MTs, namely the ratio of the total length of the MT-associated MFs to the length of the MTs in PPBs, which provides information on the extent of MF binding to the MTs. The ratio is very low in interphase cells without a PPB. In prophase 1, the ratio is the highest (∼0.3), in prophase 2, the ratio drops to ∼0.2, and in late prophase, the ratio falls to ∼0.07.

A panoramic image can be used as a *Visual Compass*; the difference between a goal image and rotated images from nearby locations is minimised when the rotated images are at the orientation of the original [@pcbi.1002336-Zeil1], [@pcbi.1002336-Philippides1], [@pcbi.1002336-Labrosse1]. Therefore, rather than tagging remembered images with an orientation, or rotating into a particular orientation during learning and recall, we use a similar mechanism to a visual compass to search for familiar viewing directions. The fact that ants are moving, and therefore facing, in the overall route direction most of the time during learning means that these familiar viewing directions implicitly define the movement directions required to stay on the route. It is therefore sufficient to learn all of the views exactly as they are experienced. The problem of navigation is then re-framed in terms of a rotational search for the views associated with a route. By visually scanning the environment and moving in the direction that is most similar to the views encountered during learning an ant should be able to reliably retrace her route.

Note that this process associates the current view not with a particular place but instead with a particular action, that is, "what should I do?" not "where am I?". In addition, it means that compass information is not necessary during either learning or recall [@pcbi.1002336-Graham2].

Using views for route guidance {#s1d}
------------------------------

Given the success of snapshot-type models in place-homing, it is natural to assume that navigation over larger scales, that is, along routes, could be achieved by internalizing a series of stored views linked together as a sequence. Route behaviour in this framework would entail homing from one stored view to the next in a fixed sequence. While it has been shown that the catchment areas of individual snapshots can be quite large [@pcbi.1002336-Zeil1]--[@pcbi.1002336-Philippides1], [@pcbi.1002336-Basten1], attempts to model route navigation using linked view-based homing have shown it to be a nontrivial problem which requires the agent to both robustly determine at which point a waypoint should be set during route construction and when a waypoint has been reached during navigation [@pcbi.1002336-Franz1], [@pcbi.1002336-Vardy2], [@pcbi.1002336-Smith1]. Essentially,

OCD is characterized by intrusive, unwanted, and recurrent thoughts (obsessions) and/or repetitive ritualistic behaviors (compulsions). It has been suggested that proinflammatory cytokines are involved in the etiopathogenesis of OCD. These results suggest the existence of a possible immune dysfunction in OCD. While some authors reported decreases of TNF-*α*, IL-6, and natural killer (NK) activities \[[@B8]--[@B11]\], others found increase of NK cells in OCD patients \[[@B12]\].

An association of OCD with infectious disease and alterations in immune function was first considered when people who had recovered from von Economo\'s encephalitis began to present neuropsychiatric symptomps. In addition recent research revealed an association between OCD and streptococcal infections. It has been hypothesized that subgroup of children with OCD develops the illness following infection with Group A *β*-hemolytic streptococcus \[[@B13]\].

The most extensively investigated cytokines in neuropsychiatric disorders are TNF-*α* and IL-6 due to their effects on central nervous system (CNS). TNF-*α* is produced by macrophages and circulating monocytes, and plays an important role in a variety of infectious, inflammatory, and autoimmune conditions \[[@B14]\]. TNF-*α* also affects central processes directly or indirectly through stimulation of vagal afferents \[[@B15]--[@B17]\]. Thus, this cytokine has been emerging as an important role of the CNS function \[[@B18]\]. IL-6 acts on a variety of cells, regulating immune response, acute phase reaction, and is implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory disease \[[@B19]\]. IL-6 is synthesized and colocalized with its own receptors in the brain, and it is expressed in small quantities in the CNS even in the absence of inflammation \[[@B20], [@B21]\].

Although several studies have suggested the existence of an association between OCD and cytokine levels alteration, the findings are not consistent. Therefore, a thorough investigation of the immune system function in OCD is still warranted. In this study we have measured plasma concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-*α* in OCD patients, with the aim to see whether or not the release of these two proinflammatory cytokines is altered and if they correlate with the type of psychopathology, severity, age of onset, and duration of illness.

The study was conducted between October 2004 and July 2006. All patients were recruited from the

All data were analyzed using IBM SPSS ver. 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). To determine significant differences between the two groups in the screened continuous and categorical variables, independent Student *t*-tests, Mann-Whitney *U*-test and chi-square tests were performed, as appropriate. To analyze the association between tinnitus severity (based on THI score) and cognitive deficits (based on MoCA-K score), Pearson correlation analysis was performed. Multivariate and logistic regression analysis was performed to simultaneously assess the relative influence of cognitive deficit and associated variables including the age, sex, duration of tinnitus, and mean hearing threshold. *P*-values \<0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance.

Demographic and clinical characteristics
----------------------------------------

The patients' demographic and clinical characteristics are presented in [Table 1](#t1-ceo-2018-01914){ref-type="table"}. The mean age of the patients was 68.1±5.1 years (range, 65 to 82 years). The number of male and female was 23 (39.7%) and 35 (60.3%), respectively. The median duration of tinnitus was 2 years (range, 0.5 to 20 years). The rate of MCI based on MoCA-K was 10 out of 58 (17.2%). When comparing between the MCI and non-MCI groups, no significant difference in age (70.9±7.9 vs. 67.5±4.1 years, *P*=0.211), duration of tinnitus (*P*=0.731), or sex (*P*=0.287) was detected. There was a significant difference in hearing threshold (33.0±7.4 vs. 25.7± 8.7 dB, *P*=0.017) between two groups. But, the speech discrimination (91.6%±12.4% vs. 93.3%±7.2%, *P*=0.407) in the MCI group was similar to that in the non-MCI group. An individualized profile of each subject was presented in [Supplementary Table 1](#SD1-ceo-2018-01914){ref-type="supplementary-material"}.

Since the importance of bond strength right after the conclusion of endodontic treatment has already been established, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of cleaning methods to remove zinc oxide-eugenol-based root canal sealer (Endomethasone) on the bond strength of the self-etching adhesive to dentin. It is hypothesized that these different cleaning methods have an affect on the resin-dentin bond strength.

MATERIALS AND METHODS {#sec1-2}
=====================

Twenty bovine incisors were stored in 0.5% thymol and used within 2 months of extraction. The teeth were cut to expose the pulp chamber dentine of the middle third of the buccal crown: 5 mm was removed horizontally from the incisal portion of the crown with a double-sided diamond disc (KG Sorensen, Barueri, SP, Brazil) under refrigeration. Next, the middle third of the crown was removed at a height of approximately 8 mm corresponding to the double-sided diamond disc radius (KG Sorensen, Barueri, SP, Brazil), which then penetrated into the middle third of the incisal edge parallel to the long axis of the tooth, removing the buccal surface of the crown fragment. Once the samples were obtained, the pulp tissue was carefully removed with a spoon excavator. After the cuts, the intracoronary dentin was polished for 30 s with wet 180- and 600-grit silicon carbide abrasive paper under running water to plane and create a standardize smear layer. Then, the samples were rinsed with distilled water and dried with paper points. Twenty customized rectangular dentin fragments were obtained.

The Endomethasone N (Septodont, Saint-Maur-Dês-Fossés, France) was prepared according to the manufacturer\'s instructions and placed for 10 min in contact with the pulp chamber dentin of each sample. Specimens were divided into four groups, with five specimens in each group., according to the method of cleaning dentin used. G1, no root canal sealer was placed on dentin (control); G2, cotton pellets saturated with 0.9% sodium chlorite (NaCl); G3, cotton pellets saturated with 70% ethanol; G4, cotton pellets saturated with NaCl followed by diamond drill removing 250 μm dentin. The cleaning was performed until all the root canal sealer on the dentin was removed when viewed through an optical microscope under

The C-terminal tail of FtsZ (DYLDIPAFLRKQAD~383~) is widely conserved in bacteria and many proteins involved in cell division have been reported to bind to the tail of FtsZ. In *E. coli*, there is evidence that the tail of FtsZ interacts with five different proteins, ZipA, FtsA, MinC, ZapD and ClpX [@pgen.1004460-Lutkenhaus1], [@pgen.1004460-Shen1], [@pgen.1004460-Haney1]--[@pgen.1004460-Camberg1]. FtsZ residues I374 and L378 are critical for the interaction with ZipA, FtsA and MinC [@pgen.1004460-Shen1], [@pgen.1004460-Haney1]. Depending upon the amino acid substitutions at these two positions resistance to MinC-MinD or loss of interaction with ZipA and FtsA have been reported [@pgen.1004460-Shen2], [@pgen.1004460-Haney1]. As the tail of FtsZ is required for FtsZ-SlmA interaction, it is highly likely that substitution of these two residues would also disrupt the FtsZ-SlmA interaction. Therefore, we generated FtsZ-I374K and FtsZ-L378E and tested their interaction with SlmA in the biosensor assay. As shown in [Fig. 6A](#pgen-1004460-g006){ref-type="fig"} these mutants behaved like FtsZ~360~ as no binding signal was observed with SlmA bound to the SBS17-30mer immobilized on the biosensor. Thus, I374 and L378 are also important for the FtsZ-SlmA interaction.

ZipA competes with SlmA for the conserved C-terminal tail of FtsZ {#s2k}
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Previous studies revealed that ZipA and FtsA bind to the conserved C-terminal tail of FtsZ, although there are subtle differences in the sequence specificity [@pgen.1004460-Haney1]. Nonetheless, these proteins should compete with SlmA for binding to FtsZ. We therefore tested the C-terminal domain of ZipA, ZipA~185--328~, which binds to FtsZ with high affinity [@pgen.1004460-Hale

In this study, according to the low number of samples, inclusion and exclusion criteria, none of the patients experienced DVT, PE, CVA, MI, or had rising in BUN or serum Cr more than normal levels and we had no mortality, which is considered as a good feature of this study.

Discussion {#sec1-4}
==========

Severe bleeding is a common side effect in spinal surgeries. In recent years; a variety of assessment techniques to control and reduce bleeding associated with surgery of the spine has been evaluated. Given the importance of the prevention of severe bleeding during and after the orthopedic surgery and neurosurgery, TA alone or in comparison with other drugs or placebos was evaluated by researchers.\[[@ref19]\] Our finding is compatible with other reported series.\[[@ref10][@ref20][@ref21]\]

In this study, the average of intraoperative, 1^st^ postoperative day, and total blood loss were lower in the TA group, (considering confounding factors including age, gender, number of operated levels, fusion, and duration of operation). According to a limited number of cases and the results of previous similar studies, the results are considerable although not being statistically significant.

In a study, performed by Hiippala *et al*. reported that TA has been effective in reducing postoperative bleeding and need for blood transfusions in all knee arthroplasty surgery.\[[@ref22]\] In another study by Zufferey *et al*., TA is effective in reducing the risk of requiring allogeneic erythrocyte transfusion in orthopedic surgery.\[[@ref23]\] Based on the results of Neilipovitz research, reducing the need of blood transfusions by using TA has been noted, and the results are consistent with the output of this study.\[[@ref24]\] Results of a meta-analysis done by Ker *et al*. suggest that strong evidence is available for use of TA and decreased blood transfusion in surgery.\[[@ref25]\] In addition to the effectiveness of TA in reducing blood loss during surgery, decreased transfusion related complications were reported by Elwatidy *et al*. in a prospective placebo-controlled study.\[[@ref10]\]

The patients receiving TA also had less need to blood transfusion, without statistical significance. Blood transfusion cases were limited to female patients and who had undergone fusion surgeries. More need to blood transfusion in female patients might be related to underlying lower levels of Hb. None of the confounding factors, which mentioned above leaded to a significant difference

[Table 2](#pone.0134010.t002){ref-type="table"} also revealed that high COD treatment efficiency was achieved in the four CW systems. It showed that vertical subsurface flow CW systems could get a higher COD removal rate than that done by horizontal subsurface flow CW systems. Moreover, higher ammonium removal rate was observed in vertical flow CW systems as well. These results were supported by relevant researches, which confirmed that BOD and ammonium removal rates were higher in vertical flow compared to those in horizontal subsurface flow\[[@pone.0134010.ref006],[@pone.0134010.ref030]\].

On the other hand, removal rates of total nitrogen of the four CW systems were quite low(24%-35%). Denitrification process was usually considered to be limited under high oxygen concentration condition, resulting in high ammonium removal rate but low TN reduction in VSSF CWs\[[@pone.0134010.ref006]\]. On the contrary, though denitrification was suggested to be faster in horizontal subsurface flow than that in vertical flow, removal rate of ammonium and TN were both low in HSSF CWs in this work because of the restriction of nitrification process, as shown in [Table 2](#pone.0134010.t002){ref-type="table"}.

Spatial Variation of TP in Two Types of CWs {#sec012}
-------------------------------------------

Spatial variations of TP retention in substrates of HSSF CWs and VSSF CWs after 5 months of wastewater treatment were shown in the [Fig 2](#pone.0134010.g002){ref-type="fig"}, which indicated that hydraulic characteristic(e.g. type and hydraulic loading) had significant influence on TP retention and spatial distribution in the CWs.

![Content of TP in substrates in different areas of HSSF CWs(a) and VSSF CWS (b)with high and low hydraulic loading.](pone.0134010.g002){#pone.0134010.g002}

It was found that in low hydraulic loading systems, substrates in HSSF CWs showed a more remarkable difference in TP spatial distribution than that in VSSF CWs. In HSSF CWs, TP content in inflow section (front part) was obviously higher than that in the outflow section(back part). TP content in rhizosphere, near-rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere substrates in inflow

The iNYP dashboard notice has been designed using secure web services and is implemented on NYP server using risk and referral information from the BNAV database ([Figure 9](#f9-2599816){ref-type="fig"}). The notice indicates the patient's 5-year and lifetime risk of invasive breast cancer compared to the general population, high-risk criteria for breast cancer, and referral status. It also indicates whether the patient meets the guidelines for being eligible for genetic testing and provides contact information to refer patients for genetic counseling or a high-risk consultation in the breast clinic.

Discussion
==========

A comprehensive informatics framework to increase breast cancer risk assessment and chemoprevention in the primary care setting has been successfully implemented using TPB-based approach. Affecting simultaneously patients and providers may potentially result in better adherence to chemoprevention guidelines. Introduction of an interactive application may facilitate patient acceptance of optimal breast cancer prevention strategies and improve patient- provider communication. Clinical decision support for high risk breast cancer patients embedded into EMR coupled with a theory-based interactive online tool promulgating guideline-concordant practices may further engage providers into shared informed decision making with women who are at increased risk for breast cancer as recommended by USPSTF. However, the impact of the proposed informatics framework as a whole and its particular components is currently unknown. To address this gap in our knowledge a definitive randomized controlled trial testing the patient and provider decision support tools is being conducted.

In our breast clinic, the chemoprevention uptake rate among high-risk women is 37%, compared to less than 5% reported for other high-risk populations \[[@r20-2599816]\]. Our goal is to expand our success in the breast clinic by offering specialized risk counseling to a broader population of racially/ethnically diverse women screened in the primary care setting. A novel breast cancer risk navigation (BNAV) tool, which incorporates the Gail breast cancer risk model into the EMR, has been implemented to address this goal. In order to alleviate patient-related barriers to chemoprevention, a decision aid, RealRisks that allows participants to experience risk through an activity has been introduced. The development of above mentioned tools was informed by iterative input from patient and providers. As a result of this input, BNAV system integration into clinic workflow was introduced as it is depicted in [Figure 10](#f10-2599816){ref-type="fig"}. Addressing future users'

Ethics approval and consent to participate {#Sec4}
------------------------------------------

The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board at Lund University, Sweden (Dnr 2011/341). Consecutive patients fulfilling inclusion criteria were invited to participate in the study. All invited participants were provided with oral and written information, and written consent was obtained before study enrolment.

Vaccination protocol {#Sec5}
--------------------

All participants received a single 0.5 mL dose of PCV13 (Prevenar 13®, Pfizer) administered as an intramuscular injection in the deltoid muscle. At the time of vaccination, a rheumatologist performed a clinical examination and data were collected on disease and treatment characteristics and previous vaccinations using a structured protocol. All participants were encouraged to report any adverse events following vaccination, as well as possible changes in rheumatic disease. Adverse events (AEs) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were recorded in line with the Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and Clinical Safety Data Management \[[@CR12]\].

Pneumococcal serotype-specific IgG measurement {#Sec6}
----------------------------------------------

Serum samples were collected immediately before and 4--6 weeks after vaccination. Serotype-specific IgG antibody concentrations for pneumococcal serotypes 6B and 23F, both included in PCV13, were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The World Health Organization consensus pneumococcal IgG ELISA \[[@CR13]\] was performed with minor modifications, described previously \[[@CR14]\].

Opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) assay {#Sec7}
-------------------------------------

Flow cytometric OPA assay was performed for pneumococcal serotype 23F. The original method has been described by *Martinez* et al. \[[@CR15]\] and it was executed with some modifications \[[@CR14]\].

Statistical analysis {#Sec8}
--------------------

Differences between groups were analysed using the Chi-square test and the Mann-Whitney U test when appropriate. Geometric mean Ab concentrations (GMCs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated from log-transformed values. Pre- and post-PCV13 GMCs for larger groups (*n* \> 30) were compared using paired samples t-test. Pre- to postvaccine OPA and antibody changes in smaller groups were compared using Wilcoxon signed rank test. Differences in GMCs between patients (*n* \> 20) and controls were analysed using independent samples t-

The venous blood samples were obtained from all patients before induction of anesthesia for laparoscopy procedure. The blood samples were centrifuged, and the serums were stored at -20˚C until measurement. In addition, the PF samples were collected from pelvis before any manipulation. The bloody fluids were excluded. The PF samples were also centrifuged and the supernatant were stored at -20˚C until measurement.

VEGF measurement
----------------

The serum and peritoneal levels of VEGF were measured using enzyme immunoassay kit (Immuno- Biological Laboratory Co., Japan). Briefly, the kit is a solid phase sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, while the coloring agent was tetra methyl benzidine (TMB). The sample (100 μl) was put in pre coated plate (Anti-Human VEGF (16F1) Mouse IgG M0Ab Affinity Purify (Immuno-Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd, Japan), then washed after incubating for 60 minutes in 37˚C. Afterwards, the labeled antibody (HRP conjugated Anti-Human VEGF Rabbit IgG Fab' Affinity Purify (Immuno-Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd, Japan), was added, incubated and washed again. Finally, coloring agent was added, followed by stop solution, whereas the absorbance was determined at 450 nm by plate reader. The VEGF concentration was determined using standard curve.

Statistical analyses
--------------------

Data was expressed as mean ± SEM. Unpaired t test was applied to compare the parameters between the groups, while paired t test was applied to compare the parameters within the groups. The value of p\<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
=======

The average age of groups I and II are 28.9 (range: 19-44) and 30.2 (range: 24-42), respectively, while there was no statistically significant difference between two groups. In this study, 166 women were in proliferative phase, and 13 women were in secretory phase. The obtained data for VEGF level in serum and in PF from group I (the patients with endometriosis) and group 2 (control) are demonstrated in figure 1. The VEGF level in serum was significantly less than that in PF in both groups (p=0.00). However no significant difference in serum level of VEGF was detected between the two groups, but the result indicates that group I had significantly higher level of VEGF in peritoneal fluid in comparison to group II (p=0.043).

The greater cellular toxicity of gpDcoe-YML to that of gpD-YML, i.e., 20 to 1 \[comparing plasmids p675 encoding D(wild type)-YML and p674 encoding Dcoe-YML: [Table 3](#viruses-11-00869-t003){ref-type="table"} column for Relative Culture Viability at 42 °C\], may reflect a higher level of the gpDcoe-YML fusion *expression* in cells. The Dcoe (codon optimized) sequence was synthetically altered for 55 of the 110 codons in *D* \[[@B26-viruses-11-00869],[@B27-viruses-11-00869]\] to improve translation. We suggest a hypothesis that wild type *D* encoded within the lambda genome may have evolved to ensure a reduced level of *D* expression. This could explain why cells with pcIpR-Dcoe-timm or pcIpR-Dcoe-YML-timm that are marginally induced for *D* expression at 37 °C can efficiently complement the growth of λ*imm*434*D*am123 phage (compare to D-GFP expression, [Section 3.1](#sec3dot1-viruses-11-00869){ref-type="sec"}).

The ability of the D-fusions to complement for growth of λ*imm*434*D*am123 and substitute for the defective *D* encoded on the phage genome is shown in [Table 3](#viruses-11-00869-t003){ref-type="table"} (right column). Greatly reduced phage plating was observed when the expressed *D*-fusion protein was highly toxic to cells. A high level of suppression of the *D* amber mutation was seen in cells with plasmids expressing Dcoe or the COOH-fusions Dcoe-YML and D(wild type)-YML. Very poor suppression occurred for the NH~2~-terminal fusion 15AA-Dcoe. No suppression was afforded by NH~2~-terminal His-Dcoe fusion. Except for D-HNP1, both the toxicity and suppression data suggest that polypeptide additions to the COOH-terminal end of gpD can establish antimicrobial activity, whereas the additions to the NH~2~-terminal end of gpD were somehow handicapped. This suggests that polypeptides fused to the COOH-terminal end of gpD have a higher likelihood of achieving a

Discussion {#sec1-3}
==========

Cutaneous TB is invasion of skin by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis*, or following BCG vaccination. Cutaneous TB can be acquired exogenously (inoculation from injury) or endogenously (hematogenous spread). Lupus vulgaris (LV) is the most common morphological variant of cutaneous TB (74%) followed by scrofuloderma, TB verrucosa cutis, miliary TB, and tuberculid.\[[@ref6]\]

LV presents with small sharply defined reddish-brown lesions with a gelatinous consistency (called apple jelly nodules). In scrofuloderma, skin lesions result from direct extension of underlying TB infection of lymph nodes, bone, or joints. It presents as firm, painless lesions that eventually ulcerate with a granular base. TB verrucosa cutis occurs after direct inoculation of TB into the skin and presents as a purplish or brownish-red warty growth most often over knees, elbows, hands, feet, and buttocks. Miliary TB occurs in immunocompromised patients and spreads from the primary infection (usually in the lungs) to other organs and tissues through the bloodstream. Skin lesions are small (millet-sized) red spots that develop into ulcers and abscesses. Tuberculid occurs as generalized exanthem in patients with moderate or high degree of immunity to TB because of the previous infection. Patient usually has good health with no identifiable focus of active TB in skin or elsewhere.

Diagnosis of cutaneous TB becomes a challenge at times. Nowadays, latest technique like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is available which can effectively diagnose the condition. However, sometimes, even histopathology and PCR also make the condition difficult to diagnose like in paucibacillary nature of disease.\[[@ref7][@ref8]\] Furthermore, there are many histopathological differential diagnoses present such as sarcoidosis, tuberculoid leprosy (which has granulomas predominantly around dermal nerves), deep fungal infections (special stains can reveal fungus), and granulomatous foreign body reactions (polariscopic examination can reveal the agent).

Meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products are major sources of carnitine in the diet. On the other hand, the content of carnitine in food of plant origin is low. In non-vegetarians, 75% of carnitine sources are obtained from diet, which provides 2--12 µmol of carnitine per kilogram per day (µmol/Kg/day), and the remaining 25% originates from endogenous production, which provides 1.2 µmol/Kg/day. In contrast, endogenous synthesis provides the majority (\>90%) of total carnitine in strict vegetarians, in whom dietary intake provides less than 0.1 µmol/Kg/day of carnitine \[[@B9-molecules-24-03251],[@B10-molecules-24-03251],[@B11-molecules-24-03251]\].

The vast majority (\>99%) of body carnitine is situated in the intracellular compartment. Circulating carnitine represents only about 0.5% of body carnitine. Therefore, normal plasma free carnitine levels are low, ranging between 25--50 µmol/L \[[@B12-molecules-24-03251]\]. Normal levels are variable based on age and gender. In one study of 80 healthy volunteers, mean serum-free carnitine levels in males were 41 µmol/L (range 26.4--53.4) whereas in females the mean was 39 µmol/L (range 19.2--44.5) \[[@B13-molecules-24-03251]\]. The same study showed a positive correlation between carnitine levels (free and total) with age, although in males the correlation didn't reach statistical significance \[[@B13-molecules-24-03251]\]. Normal carnitine levels are maintained by balance between dietary intake, endogenous synthesis, and renal reabsorption. Based on carnitine content in food, bioavailability of dietary carnitine is about 54--86% \[[@B14-molecules-24-03251]\]. In the kidney the majority of carnitine (90--99% of filtered load) is reabsorbed until saturation is reached. The renal threshold for carnitine excretion is around 50 μmol/L. The kidneys are very efficient in maintaining normal levels of plasma carnitine by modulating urinary carnitine excretion according to the intake from diet \[[@B14-molecules-24-03251]\].

We screened 256 consecutive patients between at least 18 years of age and less than 70 years of age with *de novo* STEMI, who presented within 6 h of symptoms onset and underwent primary PCI at our hospital between December 2010 and February 2012. Sixty-four patients having Killip ≥3, 18 with hemodynamic instability requiring hemodynamic support devices, and 90 who had preprocedural Thrombolysis in MI (TIMI) flow grade ≥2 or thrombus grade ≤2 were excluded. Twenty-six subjects refused to participate in this study. Other exclusion criteria were contraindications for CMR, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease (Cr ≥3 mg/dL), neoplastic disease, platelet count \<150000/mL, and hemoglobin \<10 g/L. Angiographic inclusion criterion was preprocedural TIMI flow grade 0/1 or evidence of thrombus grade 3/4. In addition, the target lesion should be located in a native coronary artery in the proximal to mid segment with an estimated reference diameter of ≥2.25 mm and ≤4.25 mm. IC thrombus was scored in 5 grades as previously described.[@B23] The final study cohort comprised 40 subjects, divided into 3 groups before primary PCI, according to a random-number table: 10 patients, who received only a bolus of IC abciximab (0.25 mg/kg), 10 patients, only AT, and 20 patients, both treatments ([Fig. 1](#F1){ref-type="fig"}). Our study protocol was approved by the Ethical Review Board of Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine (Wonju, Korea). Informed consent to participate in this study was obtained from all the patients.

Coronary angiography and antithrombotic regimens
------------------------------------------------

All patients received aspirin (300 mg) and clopidogrel (300-600 mg) immediately after STEMI diagnosis by electrocardiogram (ECG). Aspirin (100 mg) and clopidogrel (75 mg) were administered for ≥12 months after PCI. After an intravenous (IV) bolus injection of unfractionated heparin (70 U/kg), IV infusion (1000 U/h) was continued, and, if necessary, additional boluses were administered to achieve an activated clotting time of 300 s. After passing through the lesion with a 0.014-inch guidewire, AT was performed before balloon predilation. Then, a bolus of IC abciximab (0.

Cisplatin continues to be widely used as a main cancer drug due to its disparity antitumor activity when compared with the other platinum analogues. In tumors and other dividing cells, CIS-DNA intrastrand crosslinks result in cytotoxicity \[[@CR10]\].

Recent studies have discovered new protocols, compounds, enzymes and molecular alterations that reduced the side effect of anticancer drugs and enhanced their cytotoxic effects \[[@CR11]-[@CR13]\].

In an attempt to minimize CIS side effects and at the same time increasing its anticancer efficacy, we investigated whether RSVL which is a naturally occurring compound that is found in many food like grapes, can enhance the cytotoxic activity of CIS against the growth of EAC cells *in vivo* and the possible protective role against CIS-induce nephrotoxicity.

In the current study treatment of tumor bearing mice with RSVL (25 mg/kg) enhanced the cytotoxic activity of CIS against the growth of EAC cells with 2.92 folds increase in long-term survivor. It seems that RSVL did not show anti-tumor activity by its own, but rather increased the anti-tumor activity of CIS against the growth of EAC cells (Figure [1](#Fig1){ref-type="fig"} and Table [1](#Tab1){ref-type="table"})). Combining resveratrol with CIS is a novel strategy that has the potential for improving the antineoplastic activity of CIS \[[@CR14]\]. It has been reported that a greatest synergism was observed when resveratrol was administered first followed by the platinum drug (CIS or oxaliplatin) 2 hr later \[[@CR15]\]. High cellular level of CIS concentrations in EAC cells has been observed when RSVL was concomitantly administered with CIS (Table [2](#Tab2){ref-type="table"}).This is in a good agreement with previous work in our laboratory, when human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 was treated with simultaneous combination of RSVL and anti-cancer drug DOX resulted in more DOX cellular uptake \[[@CR5]\]. The increase in CIS cellular uptake inside Ehrlich cells may be explained by inhibition of P-gp that plays very important role in the absorption, distribution, and elimination of anticancer drug and thus determine its efficacy and toxicity. There were many reports showed that the inhibition of P-gp considered as one of the mechanism of RSVL chemosensitizing effect to anticancer drugs \[[@CR16],[@CR17]\].

Responses to complex input stimuli {#sec010}
----------------------------------

Several experimental studies have investigated responses to more complex input stimuli such as a rapid reversal of the direction of chemoattractant gradients \[[@pone.0164674.ref012]\], stimulation with multiple sources of chemoattractant \[[@pone.0164674.ref015]\] and a combination of gradient and uniform stimuli \[[@pone.0164674.ref006]\]. To test whether our model ([Eq 1](#pone.0164674.e001){ref-type="disp-formula"}) can reproduce responses to such complex stimuli, we simulated responses following the stimulation protocols of those experiments. First, experiments have demonstrated that the direction of the gradient of the signaling molecules switches promptly upon a reversal of the direction of chemoattractant gradient \[[@pone.0164674.ref012]\]. The behavior is thought to be incompatible with a model based on the spatial instability in reaction-diffusion system, or "Turing-type pattern formation", whereas LEGI-based models reported so far can often reproduce it \[[@pone.0164674.ref029]\]. [Fig 4a](#pone.0164674.g004){ref-type="fig"} shows the level of activator *A* at the front and back as a function of time, where the direction of a linear-gradient stimulus is reversed at time *t* = 20. Consistent with the experimental result, our model switches the gradient of the activator *A*. Second, other experiments have shown that cells, when stimulated with multiple sources of chemoattractant, show localizations of the signaling molecule at multiple sites on the membrane in a way that the degree of localization dynamically follows the strength of the stimuli \[[@pone.0164674.ref015]\]. To confirm the response property of the model, we simulated the response by locating a single point source of stimulus in close proximity to the cell membrane, and then by another point source at the opposite site with increasing level of stimulus ([Fig 4b](#pone.0164674.g004){ref-type="fig"}). In consistent with the experimental results, the model showed multiple peaks of activator *A* dynamically following the strength of the input stimuli. Third, another interesting property of the gradient sensing system is its 'inversed' responsiveness to a spatially-uniform stimulus: When cells are exposed to a gradient stimulus, then no stimulus (by withdrawing the gradient stimulus), and then a spatially-uniform stimulus, the back of the cell in the gradient stimulus responds more strongly than

Immune activation within the central nervous system (CNS) is classically observed in several immune-mediated disorders, viral infections and also in human neurodegenerative diseases. Although, often the immune responses may contribute directly or indirectly to neuronal damage, not all immune responses in the CNS are damaging because they assist in repair and regeneration. But heightened immune responses can be indicative of underlying pathogenic process, which may shift the delicate balance between beneficial and detrimental response \[[@B2],[@B3]\].

As global research on neurodegenerative diseases progresses on various fronts, many similarities between classical neurodegenerative diseases and virus-mediated neurodegeneration are becoming apparent at both anatomic and sub-cellular level \[[@B1],[@B4],[@B5]\]. Supporting these observations, a number of viruses have been shown to be associated with different types of neurodegenerative diseases, which can guide us underpin mechanisms in neurodegeneration (Table [1](#T1){ref-type="table"}). We know that neurotropic viruses are able to induce considerable neuronal dysfunction by inducing alterations and degenerations of neurons both directly and indirectly leading to devastating effects (Table [1](#T1){ref-type="table"}). Viruses can injure neurons by direct killing, cell lysis and by inducing apoptosis. Thus regardless of the route of entry of neurotropic viruses into the CNS, viral infection of the CNS leads to activation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. Viral antigens preferentially activate TLRs 3, 7 and 8 are driving innate and adaptive immune responses and leading to neuronal damage, which occurs through direct damage, killing, release of free radicals, cellular activation and inflammation \[[@B2]\]. In contrast, the immunocompetent host is able to clear viruses rapidly.

Although early safety studies funded by industry in 1995--1998 concluded that GT soybeans and other herbicide tolerant GM crops were 'substantially equivalent' to ordinary varieties, those studies had major flaws, e.g., the plant material was cultivated in artificial conditions in test-fields without spraying with the herbicides that farmers used in commercial production \[[@B10-foods-08-00669],[@B17-foods-08-00669]\].

Investigating whether commercially-farmed Roundup Ready soy was compositionally equivalent to conventional and organic soybeans, it was a surprise to find that 'ready-to-market' Roundup Ready GM soybeans from Iowa, accumulated glyphosate at relatively high levels: on average, 9.0 mg of glyphosate were found per kilo of soybean \[[@B17-foods-08-00669]\]. In contrast, no glyphosate was found in conventional or organic soybeans grown in the same area and year (which was as expected as those plants would die from glyphosate exposure). Other differences were also found; organic soybean contained significantly more protein, zinc, barium, and several amino acids, and less saturated fat, omega-6 and selenium than the two types of soy from conventional 'industrial agriculture' \[[@B17-foods-08-00669]\].

Possibly prompted by those findings, the USDA initiated a separate study of this issue \[[@B18-foods-08-00669]\], which reported lower residues of glyphosate (approximately 1 mg/kg) and only insignificant compositional differences between Roundup Ready soybeans and conventional soybeans. In contrast, our analysis found that soy from organic, conventional and Roundup Ready soybean could be readily differentiated statistically (with discriminant analysis), based solely on compositional data \[[@B17-foods-08-00669]\]. Subsequently a new research question arose: would the observed differences in composition translate into significant quality differences when those soybeans were used as feed or food?

In life-cycle *D. magna* feeding studies the evidence showed that the test organisms performed significantly less well (with lower rates of survival and of reproduction) when fed Roundup Ready soybean as compared to the conventional and organic counterparts \[[@B19-foods-08-00669]\].

Statistical analysis
--------------------

Haplogroup frequency differences between patient and control cohorts were tested by pair-wise-exact tests of sample differentiation \[[@r14]\] using the [Arlequin 3.11](http://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/arlequin3/) package. The frequency of determined haplogroups, between cases and controls were compared with the ÷^2^ test or with Fisher's exact tests when appropriate. To keep statistically adequate haplogroup sub-sample sizes within cohorts, when necessary, mtDNA haplogroups were collapsed into larger haplogroup identities following a phylogenetic criterion \[[@r13]\].

Results
=======

Haplogroup frequencies obtained for the POAG patients, healthy matched controls (HMC) and the general Saudi Arab population (HSA) are listed in [Table 1](#t1){ref-type="table"}. Pair-wise exact tests between cohorts, based on total haplogroup frequencies, showed that HMC and HSA controls are homogenous groups (p=0.516). On the other hand, the POAG cohort differs significantly (p=0.028) from HSA controls only. A haplogroup by haplogroup inspection ([Table 1](#t1){ref-type="table"}) shows that haplogroup L frequency (0.216) and, in less degree, to the N1 (0.045) frequency in POAG as the most different from HSA controls (0.117 and 0.081, respectively). In fact, ÷^2^ test analysis confirmed that haplogroup L was in a significant excess (p=0.001) and haplogroup N1 in a significant decrease (p=0.04) in POAG compared to the HSA group. Furthermore, matched controls HMC also presents a significant decrease of L haplotypes (0.129) compared to POAG (p=0.03) and have, comparatively, more N1 haplotypes (0.07) although without reaching significance (p=0.250). These data could be interpreted as that, the African haplogroup L is associated with the risk of developing POAG while the Eurasian haplogroup N1 could have a mild protective effect on this illness.

Discussion
==========

From the results obtained here, it can be deduced that there is a POAG predisposition in those Saudi individuals with mtDNA of African ancestry. The significantly greater susceptibility to POAG in subjects with African asc

*XLOC_012319*, an ∼18-kb intergenic lncRNA gene ([Figure 4](#fig4){ref-type="fig"}B), is expressed at high levels in segmentally repeated neuronal precursors at the ventral midline at stages 9 or 10 and later in a subset of neurons overlapping *worniu* and *prospero* expression in the ventral nerve cord and brain ([Figure 4](#fig4){ref-type="fig"}C). The expression of this lncRNA partially overlaps the expression of *sim* and is detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm ([Figure 4](#fig4){ref-type="fig"}C, lower panels). This very specific spatiotemporal expression and accumulation in the nucleus suggest a putative function in regulating the development of the embryonic nervous system. We deleted an ∼12.5-kb region, corresponding to more than half of the entire lncRNA gene, including its promoter and three DNaseI-hypersensitive sites (DHSs), to ensure that we would abolish its expression ([Figure 4](#fig4){ref-type="fig"}B). The knockout was confirmed by PCR using genomic DNA (not shown), RNA-seq ([Figure 4](#fig4){ref-type="fig"}B), and FISH ([Figure 4](#fig4){ref-type="fig"}D) from homozygous mutant embryos. Despite the gene's striking expression pattern, the lncRNA deletion had no effect on viability under normal laboratory conditions: the progeny of crosses between heterozygous parents followed expected Mendelian proportions, producing homozygous viable and fertile animals ([Table 1](#tbl1){ref-type="table"}). To assess a potential role of the lncRNA under stressful conditions, we challenged the knockout flies by placing heterozygous parents at 29**°**C but again failed to see any deviation from the expected proportions of mutant versus wild-type (WT) progeny ([Table 1](#tbl1){ref-type="table"}). Similarly, we placed both heterozygous and homozygous mutant flies separately under an extreme caloric restricted diet, housed in vials with only 1% agarose as their sole source of food, and observed a similar life expectancy of ∼4 days for both genotypes (not shown). The lncRNA *XLOC_012319* therefore appears to be a non-essential gene in terms of viability under laboratory conditions. We also did not observe differences in the development of neurons at these embryonic stages, as judged by immunofluorescence with a neuronal marker (Futsch;

Structural determination
------------------------

It was previously reported that periplasmic isomerase DsbC plays a key role in maintaining CueP protein in a reduced state in *S. enterica* ([@b40-molce-38-8-715]). *C. dipththeriae* does not have a DsbC homologue in the genome like other Gram-positive bacteria ([@b21-molce-38-8-715]). We identified a gene that encodes a DsbA homologous protein (*Cd*DsbA) in the *C. diphtheriae* genome as a putative functional substitute for DsbC*.*

DsbA from *C. diphtheriae* encodes a protein of 289 amino acid residues with a putative N-terminal signal peptide (residues 1--21) for export out of the cytoplasmic membrane, which was predicted by SignalP ([@b30-molce-38-8-715]). The transmembrane prediction program TMHMM suggested that residues 12--31 were located in the transmembrane region, while residues 32 to the C-terminus were located on the outer plasma membrane ([@b5-molce-38-8-715]). Moreover, BdbD, a functional and structural homologue of DsbA, was shown to be localized outside of the cytoplasmic membrane by its N-terminal transmembrane segment ([@b7-molce-38-8-715]). When we expressed a truncated protein lacking the predicted N-terminal signal peptide and transmembrane segment, the protein was produced in a soluble form. Taken together, *Cd*DsbA is likely anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane via its N-terminal transmembrane segment similar to BdbD, although this remains to be validated experimentally.

We obtained crystals of the truncated form of *Cd*DsbA (residues 32--289) in the reduced condition. The crystal structure was determined using the SAD method with selenomethionine-labeled crystals ([@b32-molce-38-8-715]). A high-quality electron density map was produced, and the majority of the model could be traced. The crystals belonged to the *P*2~1~2~1~2~1~ space group with a single molecule in the asymmetric unit ([Table 1](#t1-molce-38-8-715){ref-type="table"}). The final model was refined against the 1.5 Å resolution native dataset of

4.1. Materials and Methods {#sec4.1}
--------------------------

Reagents and solvents required for the synthesis of GL and GL-NPs were purchased from Alfa Aesar, Avra, Merck, SRL, TCI chemicals, and Sigma-Aldrich and used as such without any further purification. Compounds were purified using LR grade solvents, and distilled solvents were used when considered necessary. The progress of the reaction was monitored using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on the 60G F~254~ precoated silica gel plates procured from Merck and visualized with the help of ultraviolet light or sulfuric acid spray or molecular iodine or *p*-anisaldehyde stain. ^1^H- and ^13^C-NMR spectra for the glycolipid were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 300 MHz spectrometer at room temperature in dimethyl sulfoxide-*d*~6~. Chemical shifts (δ) are reported with respect to the internal standard, tetramethylsilane, in parts per million (ppm), and coupling constants (*J*) are given in Hz. Proton multiplicity is assigned using the following abbreviations: singlet (s), doublet (d), triplet (t), quartet (q), and multiplet (m). Fourier transform infrared FTIR spectra of the cotton fabric, fabric coated with GL, and GL-NPs were recorded in the attenuated total reflectance mode using a PerkinElmer 100 FTIR spectrometer in the spectral range of 4000--500 cm^--1^. Field emission scanning electron microscope integrated with an energy-dispersive X-ray system (JEOL, JSM-6701F, Japan) was used to observe the morphology of self-assembled GL, cotton fabric, and fabric coated with GL and GL-AgNPs. An X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., K-Alpha, USA) was used to record the XPS spectra of GL-AgNPs and were compared with those in our previously reported literature. XRD of GL-AgNPs, fabric, and fabric with GL-AgNPs was performed on a BRUKER-binary V3 diffractometer system, and the results were compared with native self-assembled GL.

Coincident with the upregulation of miR-182 expression in PlGF mice, there was significantly reduced expression of Bcat2, Foxo3 and Adcy6 transcripts ([Fig. 4b](#f4){ref-type="fig"}). Consequently, the treatment with anti-miR-182 partially restored the expression of Adcy6 and completely restored the expression of Bcat2 and Foxo3 to control levels ([Fig. 4b](#f4){ref-type="fig"}).

Next, we addressed whether miR-182 negatively regulated the expression of Bcat2, Foxo3 and Adcy6 transcripts in an isolated cell system. The treatment of MEFs with a miR-182 mimic resulted in a \~65% reduction of Adcy6 and a \~45% reduction of Bcat2 and Foxo3 expression ([Fig. 4c](#f4){ref-type="fig"}), consistent with our *in vivo* observations.

Angiogenesis-induced hypertrophic response augments myocardial hypertrophy during LV pressure overload and protects against early contractile dysfunction
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to determine whether hypertrophy induced by angiogenic stimulation has a molecular signature distinct from the pathological hypertrophic response to LV pressure overload and/or has a beneficial effect, PlGF and PlGF/RGS4 mice were subjected to TAC after angiogenic stimulation for 3 weeks (schematically described in [Fig. 5a](#f5){ref-type="fig"}). After 3 weeks of angiogenesis, there was no cardiac hypertrophy at the time of TAC in PlGF or PlGF/RGS4 mice ([Fig. 5b](#f5){ref-type="fig"}), consistent with our prior data[@b11]. As expected, at 2 and 6 weeks post-TAC, echocardiography demonstrated significant hypertrophy in all groups. However, the increase in LVPW thickness and LV mass was \~2-fold higher in PlGF mice than in either control or PlGF/RGS4 mice ([Fig. 5b](#f5){ref-type="fig"}). A greater degree of myocardial hypertrophy in PlGF mice was also evidenced by higher HW/BW ratios ([Fig. 5c](#f5){ref-type="fig"}). Although in PlGF mice the heart doubled in size by 2 weeks after TAC, the cardiac contractile function was preserved with significantly higher LVEF than in control mice subjected to TAC ([Fig. 5d](#f5){ref-type="fig"}). However, there was a

In each of the 193 samples, the authors used microarray technology to survey the gene expression levels of approximately 25 000 human genes and determined the sequence composition of half a million of the single nucleotides distributed throughout the human genome and known to be polymorphic among humans (single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs). In the brain, they reliably detected signals for more than half of all the transcripts (14 078) and more than two-thirds of all the SNPs (366 140) present on the arrays. Following the approach implemented in several previous studies conducted on human cell lines or the mouse brain, the authors used gene expression levels as quantitative traits that can be associated with the SNP profiles of the individuals ([@b2]; [@b3]; [@b4]). The sheer amount of data gives the authors considerable power to detect such associations. Indeed, they succeed in linking gene expression differences to SNPs for as many as 2975 transcripts. Surprisingly, in almost 97% of the cases (2876 transcripts), the corresponding SNPs were located far away from the expressed gene (further one million nucleotides from each side). This is unusual, given that the majority of the expression differences observed between various mouse strains---a sort of artificial equivalent of different human populations---are caused by nucleotide polymorphisms in *cis-*regulatory elements as well ([@b4]). It is thus intriguing to speculate that, unlike in mice, in humans much of the expression variation observed among individuals may be caused by mutations in *trans-*acting expression regulators, such as transcription factors or microRNAs, rather than by polymorphism in the regulatory elements adjacent to the gene, such as promoters.

More generally, the study provides important insight into the effect that nucleotide variation among humans has on gene expression in one of the most complex tissues---the brain. It will greatly facilitate future studies of gene expression and SNP variation in cognitive disorders by providing an essential reference for identifying pathological changes associated with disease.

Still, with regard to the connection between genotypic and phenotypic variation, the step from gene expression variation to an organism\'s phenotype remains obscure. The authors make all their observations using brains of neuropathologically normal individuals; thus, all genetic and expression variation should be compatible with normal human brain activity. Does it mean that all this variation is completely neutral with respect to the phenotype? One could argue that some variation may reflect individual differences in cognitive, social or emotional traits. Yet the extent or even the existence of such a functional connection between gene expression in the brain and one\'s personality is far from certain. It could also be argued that gene expression

According to the survey and case studies, three of the six fellows claimed already to have made an impact on policies and/or guidelines - longer-term salary funding can allow fellows to develop a distinct role or focus which lends itself more to policy development. For example, a key paper by Mike Thomas \[[@B20]\] is already being used in recent guidelines from the British Thoracic Society/Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Respiratory Care \[[@B21]\] to support the use of breathing exercises for improved control of asthma and quality of life.

Using the methods described above we were able to establish that not only were papers from some Asthma UK-funded research cited on international and national guidelines, and other policy statements, but we also identified some examples when they supported key points and were either the only evidence used to support the point, or an important part of it. Some examples are given in the case study on research on immunotherapy that was part funded by Asthma UK \[[@B22],[@B23]\] \[see Additional file [4](#S4){ref-type="supplementary-material"}\]. Other examples of national and/or international guidelines (or specific sections) influenced by Asthma UK-funded research, along with the Asthma UK-funded paper cited in the guideline, include ones on: cough \[[@B24],[@B25]\]; asthma diagnosis in children \[[@B26],[@B27]\]; and inhaled corticosteroid resistance \[[@B26],[@B28]\].

Whilst there are often time lags involved in achieving an impact on policy, Asthma UK also supported some explicit and successful attempts to provide evidence for guidelines in areas in which there were gaps. In such situations there could be a rapid uptake of the findings. For example, Richard Hubbard specifically applied to Asthma UK for funding to develop stronger evidence on the safety of asthma medicines during pregnancy, an area where expert analysis of existing guidelines indicated the evidence was weak \[[@B29]\]. The findings from this project were published in late 2008 \[[@B30]\], and were almost immediately incorporated into an update of the 2008 guidelines from the British Thoracic Society and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network published in June 2009 \[[@B31]\].

### Informing product development

In the survey only a small minority of projects -- just 17% - included in this research claim an impact on product development already, and 31% claim to expect some future impact. The impact on product development from Asthma UK projects and from chair funding takes various forms, including helping to identify new roles for existing products

A very feasible way to obtain PEDOT:PSS complex is the oxidative polymerization of EDOT in aqueous dispersion using sodium peroxodisulfate as the oxidant combined with a PSS template polymer. The PSS in the complex has two important roles. One is to act as counterions for charge balancing. A monomolecular oxidation product can be formed without counterions. Another role of PSS is to keep the PEDOT segments dispersed in the aqueous solution as the PEDOT polycation is hardly soluble in any solvent. The obtained PEDOT:PSS aqueous dispersion is a deep-blue opaque solution. We also need to note that the molecular weight of PEDOT is only among 1000 to 2500 Da (about 6 to 18 repeating units) resembling an oligomeric nature \[[@B6-polymers-12-00145]\]. Research from Inganas, et al. demonstrated this polymer complex is stable due to the ionic PEDOT^+^ and PSS^−^ not being separated by capillary electrophoresis \[[@B7-polymers-12-00145]\].

PEDOT:PSS aqueous dispersion was first commercialized under the trade name of Baytron^®^ by Bayer AG, followed by H.C. Starck and currently by Heraeus under the trade name of Clevios^™^. The company of Agfa Gevaert N.V. (German) also introduced PEDOT:PSS for large-scale printing applications under the trade name of Orgacon^™^. The PEDOT:PSS dispersions are classified into different grades based on the solids content and the ratio of PEDOT to PSS. The component strongly influences the particle size and distribution, viscosity, conductivity, and transmittance after film formation of the dispersion \[[@B6-polymers-12-00145]\]. [Table 1](#polymers-12-00145-t001){ref-type="table"} summarizes important properties of the commercial PEDOT:PSS Clevios dispersions.

2.2. Properties of PEDOT:PSS {#sec2dot2-polymers-12-00145}
----------------------------

PEDOT:PSS possesses several characteristics, such as high transmittance in the visible range, high and adjustable electrical conductivity, excellent thermal stability, high work function, as well as good film-forming ability by versatile fabrication techniques.

Here, $SC$ is the slot capacity to carry maximum number of bits and is computed as:$$SC = 960 \times 2^{SO - 2}$$

Each GTS requesting node calculates $GTS^{req}$ and send it to the coordinator in CAP. A GTS requesting frame is shown in [Figure 3](#sensors-20-01971-f003){ref-type="fig"}.

PAN Coordinator receives GTS requests only in CAP. At the end of the CAP, it evaluates the GTS requests. If GTS requests are within the available slot limits, then it allocates GTS to all the GTS requesting nodes. In case, requesting GTS are more than 7, then the PAN coordinator scrutinizes GTS on a first come first serve basis. All the scrutinized nodes are informed about their allocated CFP slots with their starting and ending slot during the next beacon frame. An increase in successful nodes increases the length of the beacon frame that reduces the CAP length. PAN coordinator also ensures to maintain the minimum CAP duration, as it should not be less than *aMinCAPLength* value. The scrutinized nodes retrieve information about their assigned CFP slots from the GTS descriptor field of the beacon frame.

2.2. Brief Overview of ESS {#sec2dot2-sensors-20-01971}
--------------------------

This section discusses the efficient superframe structure introduced in \[[@B23-sensors-20-01971]\] as shown in [Figure 2](#sensors-20-01971-f002){ref-type="fig"}. In ESS, CFP precedes soon after the beacon frame and then followed by CAP. In case, there is no GTS request received by the PAN coordinator then, there is no CFP and CAP will commence right after the Beacon frame. CFP duration in ESS is similar in size as offered by the standard, however, each CFP slot duration is halved to increase the slot capacity to 14 instead of 7. The salient feature of ESS is to avoid the unnecessary CAP delay faced by a GTS requesting node in the next BI. This significantly reduces the network delay faced by the GTS requesting nodes. Besides, 14 GTS can accommodate more GTS requesting nodes to transmit their data in a BI, that improves the network throughput. The reduced delay and improved throughput in ESS is achieved at the cost of some modifications in the existing parameters of the standard.

The Superframe structure

Datasets A and B ([Fig. 1](#fig-1){ref-type="fig"}) ([@ref-22]) consisted of ten simulated, smooth, random 1D Gaussian fields to which a Gaussian pulse was added at time = 75%. The degrees of freedom and number of time nodes were *ν* = 9 and *Q* = 101, respectively, for both datasets. The pulse was slightly larger in Dataset B than in Dataset A. Both were analyzed using six procedures, in order of increasing conservativeness: (1) 0D analyses on the local maxima at time = 75%, (2--4) 1D ROI analysis with ROIs centered at time = 75% and with temporal sizes of ±5%, ±10% and ±15%, respectively, (5) 1D full-field analysis (i.e., with ROI size = 100%), and (6) 1D full-field analysis with a Bonferroni correction. The latter assumes independence amongst adjacent trajectory nodes so is overly conservative for smooth data ([@ref-22]).

### Experimental datasets

Dataset C ([Fig. 2A](#fig-2){ref-type="fig"}) ([@ref-18]) (*ν* = 7, *Q* = 101) contained stance-phase sagittal plane knee angles from eight participants who each performed both side-shuffle and v-cut maneuvers. We started with 0D analysis of maximal knee flexion (i.e., *S* = 0), then conducted three ROI analyses with ROIs centered approximately on maximal flexion (time = 50%) and with temporal extents of 10%, 40% and 80%, respectively. Finally, the 1D full-field ROI and Bonferroni procedures were applied as in the simulated datasets.

After the patient had opened his or her eyes as a response to language stimulation, the degree of emergence agitation of the patient was measured using Aono\'s four-point scale ([Table 1](#T1){ref-type="table"}). The degree of pain was investigated through a numeric rating scale (NRS) (0 = no pain, 10 = unimaginably severe pain). The measurements were repeated every 2 minutes to obtain the peak NRS and peak Aono\'s four-point scale scores. In addition, the exposure time to anesthetics, surgery time, time from end of surgery to extubation, and duration of emergence agitation were investigated. Patients received 25 µg fentanyl IV when their NRS score was found to be higher than 3; the total amount of fentanyl administered was recorded. When emergence agitation continued for more than 3 minutes, 10 mg of nalbuphine was administered IV. When emergence agitation continued for more than 1 min after drug administration, patients received 10 mg nalbuphine was injected IV, repeatedly.

The patients were observed for the occurrence of complications or side effects, while being observed for nausea, vomiting, tremors, and hypersalivation. If a patient was experienced nausea or vomiting, the patient received 0.3 mg ramosetron by IV; pethidine 25 mg was administered IV to patients if they were experiencing tremors. When respiratory failure or laryngospasm occurred, assisted respiration was performed, and endotracheal intubation was performed again if considered necessary. Emergence agitation was defined to be when the Aono\'s four-point scale score was 3 or higher \[[@B6]\]. When the patient was hemodynamically stable, could maintain their own airway, and oxygen saturation was maintained at greater than 95% during atmospheric respiration, the patient was transported to the ward, and the duration of stay in the recovery room was recorded.

Data was expressed as mean ± standard deviation, and SPSS version 12.0 was used in the statistical analysis. The t-test was used in the analysis of parametric data between the 2 groups, and the Mann-Whitney U test was used for non-parametric data. In the case of categorical data, the chi-square test was used, and the Fisher\'s exact test was used when necessary. Spearman\'s correlation was used to analyze the correlation between patient\'s pain and emergence agitation. Findings were considered to be statistically significant when the P value was less than 0.05.

In 2008, five countries reported outbreaks of HPAI A/H5N1 in poultry/wild birds in Europe (Germany, Russia, Switzerland, Ukraine, UK) \[[@b4-viruses-01-01351]--[@b12-viruses-01-01351]\]. Based on the available sequences, previously circulating clades and sublineages disappeared from Europe, with the only exception of clade 2.2 sublineage III that was responsible for the outbreaks in the UK ([Figure 1](#f1-viruses-01-01351){ref-type="fig"}) and the Ukraine (based on the analysis of the two partial sequences of 184 and 248 nucleotides available in GenBank; data not shown).

It is interesting to note that a similar situation was described for Nigeria. In this African country, viruses circulating in 2006 and 2007 (clades 2.2.1, 2.2 I and 2.2 II) apparently disappeared, while in 2008 clade 2.2 sublineage III was detected for the first time \[[@b41-viruses-01-01351]\].

Sequences available for 2008 in Russia indicate that viruses of clade 2.3.2, commonly circulating in Eastern Asia, were involved in the outbreak ([Figure 1](#f1-viruses-01-01351){ref-type="fig"}). Sequences for the remaining two countries were not available at the time of writing.

Focusing on the European continent, at present only Germany and Russia reported cases of HPAI A/H5N1 in 2009 in wild birds. Sequences available from viruses isolated in Russia (Tyva Republic) indicate the persistence in the wild bird population of the Asian clade 2.3.2 ([Figure 1](#f1-viruses-01-01351){ref-type="fig"}, [Table 2](#t2-viruses-01-01351){ref-type="table"}).

Therefore, in the Russian Federation there was no reporting concerning the circulation of clades 2.2 and 2.2.1 from 2008 to July 2009.

5.2.. Spatial migration of H5N1 virus in Europe

As indicated by the phylogenetic analysis, A/H5N1 viruses collected from 19 European countries are thoroughly interspersed in the ML tree inferred for the HA gene ([Figure 1](#f1-viruses-01-01351){ref-type="fig"}), indicating widespread viral gene flow throughout Europe.

### 3.2.1. DPPH^•^ Radical Scavenging Assay

Radical scavenging activity of extracts against stable DPPH^•^ (2,2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl hydrate, Sigma-Aldrich Chemie, Steinheim, Germany) was determined spectrophotometrically by using slightly modified method of Brand-Williams *et al.* (1995) \[[@B48-molecules-18-04419]\]. 5,8-DHC was dissolved in methanol at 0.0025, 0.005, 0.010 and 0.025% concentrations before reaction. A 2 mL aliquot of DPPH^•^ solution in methanol (6 × 10^−5^ M) was mixed with a 50 μL of 5,8-DHC solution in 1 cm path length quartz cuvette. The decreasing absorbance at 515 nm was recorded on a UV spectrophotometer Spectronic Genesys 8 (Spectronic Instruments, Rochester, NY, USA) during 16 min reaction time at 1 min intervals until the absorbance curve reached the plateau. The same amount of methanol and DPPH^•^ solution was used as a blank. The experiments were carried out in triplicate. The capacity to scavenge the DPPH^•^ is expressed as % inhibition, which was calculated using the following formula: where A~B~ is the absorbance of the blank sample (t = 0) and A~X~ is the absorbance of the reaction solution at t = 16 min. The results were also expressed as an effective concentration IC~50~, which shows the amount of 5,8-DHC required to decrease the initial DPPH^•^ concentration in the reaction mixture by 50%.

### 3.2.2. ABTS^•+^ Radical Cation Decolorization Assay

The experiments were carried out using a slightly modified 2,2'-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS, Sigma-Aldrich Chemie, Steinheim, Germany) decolorization assay \[[@B49-molecules-18-04419]\]. Stock solution of ABTS (2 mM) was prepared by dissolving in 50 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) obtained by dissolving 0.27 g of KH~2~PO~4~ (Jansen Chimica, Beerse, Belgium), 1.42 g of Na~2

Time course of microbial community development. {#s2.5}
-----------------------------------------------

Since all community structures were determined in 4-week-old plants, it is important to know whether the communities were stable or still in transition at this time. To address this, the colonization of *M. truncatula* was analyzed weekly for 5 weeks. A single plant species was used for practical reasons; however, as it had already been established that 4-week-old plants of different species have broadly similar microbiotas, we tested whether this observation might depend on sampling age. For *Medicago* spp., the analysis was expanded to include the microbiotas of both the phyllosphere and nitrogen-fixing nodules formed on the roots of this legume. The root microbiotas were distinct after 1 week, had stabilized by the second week, and became relatively stable over subsequent weeks ([Fig. 5a](#fig5){ref-type="fig"} and [S9a](#figS9){ref-type="supplementary-material"} and b). This was confirmed by PERMANOVA, with samples from all time points having a strong, significant difference (pseudo-F, 3.26; *P* \< 0.001); while PERMANOVA conducted after *in silico* removal of samples from the first week was still significant, it indicated a reduced community separation (pseudo-F, 1.34; *P* = 0.008). Based on the SIMPER analysis, archaea rather than any bacterial phyla were predominantly responsible for the weekly shift in the microbiota ([Fig. 5c](#fig5){ref-type="fig"} and [Table S1](#tabS1){ref-type="supplementary-material"}, sheet 5).

Identification of the FrzE subfamily of CheA sequences. A phylogenetic tree was built from a multiple sequence alignment of ACF class CheA sequences (Materials and Methods). Sequence labels are as described in [Table S3](#pgen.1002951.s010){ref-type="supplementary-material"}. FrzE orthologs are readily identifiable in close relatives in of *M. xanthus* (*M. fulvus*, *Corallococcus coralloides*, *Stigmatella aurantiaca*, and four species of *Anaeromyxobacter*). The Che3 system of *M. xanthus* also shows strong similarity to the Frz system based on phylogenetic analysis and gene order conservation. The shown Che systems of *Haliangium ochraceum* (Ha.och) and *Sorangium cellulosum* (So.cel) are similar to both the Frz and Che3 systems. They were assigned to the Frz system because similarity searches with FrzZ identified response regulators encoded in their gene neighborhoods; however, the two systems show differences in gene order and their chemoreceptors are predicted to be membrane bound, unlike the FrzCD receptor. Furthermore, the putative Frz system of *S. cellulosum* lacks essential components (FrzF and FrzG) and may be non-functional. Regardless, the tree reveals that the Frz system is only a very small subfamily of ACF chemotaxis systems.

----------------------------------------

[Figure 8](#sensors-16-01306-f008){ref-type="fig"} shows a typical OpenStack deployment without High Availability (HA) used as reference for our project. The proposed design uses OpenStack Havana on Ubuntu 12.04 TLS. For this purpose the deployment consists of:

-   one *controller node*, where services for the environment run.

-   one *network node*, responsible for the virtual networking.

-   two *compute nodes*, servers where Virtual Machines (VMs) are created.

-   one *storage node* to store cinder volumes and images.

-   one *util node* used to provide system administration functions, for monitoring and for maintenance purposes.

Regarding networking, four different networks are created and connected through switches. The usage of the networks is as follows:

-   *external network*: it is a public network used for Internet access for all the nodes. Allows both inbound and outbound connections for VM's.

-   *management network*: used for communication between the controller and the compute nodes. It supports the internal communication between OpenStack components.

-   *tunnel*: used for VM data communications.

-   *storage*: used for communication between the storage nodes (cinder) and the compute nodes.

5.2. Automation of OpenCart Instantiation {#sec5dot2-sensors-16-01306}
-----------------------------------------

Two of the main PaaS building blocks in [Figure 6](#sensors-16-01306-f006){ref-type="fig"} are SLIM \[[@B16-sensors-16-01306]\] and reverse proxy. SLIM is a PHP micro framework, which allows a quick deployment of RESTful APIs to communicate with the IoT modules based on Arduino open Hardware. Reverse proxy is based on Apache web server and is the entry point to the platform. It provides HTTPS for the webapps and RESTful APIs to IoT modules. Therefore, each time a new IoT module is plugged, SLIM initiates the plug-and-play process.

RESTful API queries are sent from the SLIM block to interact with the underlying IaaS controller node as [Figure 9](#sensors-16-01306-f009){ref-type="

In this study, we aimed to test whether rural children of mountain areas may have different injury epidemiological characteristics and risk factors than children living in other areas. We wanted to gather evidence identifying the potential injury risks among such children to highlight our work in developing effective injury prevention programs in similar areas.

Methods {#s2}
=======

Survey design and sampling {#s2a}
--------------------------

This research was conducted in Zunyi city, Guizhou province, southwest China, with jurisdiction over 3 districts and 12 counties in 2012. The area covers 11,882 square miles and is a typical mountain-rich area. It has a population of approximately 7.5 million; about 84.3% were farmers with a mostly agricultural economy in the 2010 census. The area includes about 2 million children under age 18 (27% of the total population).

We used a cross-sectional study design with a multistage cluster sampling method. First, we randomly sampled 3 counties in Zunyi city -- Huichuan, Zheng\'an, and Meitan -- then randomly selected 7 schools (including 3 middle schools and 4 primary schools) from 5 towns in the 3 counties. The schools represented grades 4 through 7. All students aged 8 to 17 years (mainly 9--14 years) were asked to participate if they were in the school during the survey period from June to December 2012.

Definition of injury {#s2b}
--------------------

In our survey, we defined an injury if it met one of the following criteria: (1) required medical attention [@pone.0102099-Zhu1] or (2) activities were restricted and rest was required for at least half a day [@pone.0102099-Ma1] during the 12 months before the interview. In the first criterion, medical services were often offered by the school or village doctors in clinics or hospitals. In fact, the second criterion overlapped with the first criterion (requiring medical attention); we only used it as a supplement. We excluded some very slight injuries requiring no more than half a day\'s rest using the second criterion.

Sample size estimation {#s2c}
----------------------

Considering a possible difference in injury incidence between boys and girls, we divided children into 2 strata and determined the sample size for injury incidence of one stratum by a formula [@pone.0102099-Bartlett1]: N = Zα^2^×p×q/(d^2^

Benzene is a natural constituent of crude oil, has a high octane number, and is commonly present in (bio)fuel blends (Chin and Batterman [@CR7]). Massive production and use of benzene combined with its high mobility, relatively low anaerobic biodegradation rates, and carcinogenicity make benzene one of the most widespread groundwater contaminants of concern. Therefore, benzene is typically considered as risk determining compound in fuels. Anaerobic benzene biodegradation has been described under denitrifying, iron-reducing, sulfate-reducing, and methanogenic conditions (Coates et al. [@CR8]).

Several studies have investigated the effects of mixtures of fossil-based and biobased fuels on degradation of the single components. Both antagonistic and synergistic effects have been reported during degradation of mixtures of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene (BTEX), and MtBE. The presence of BTEX was shown to enhance aerobic MtBE degradation by a mixed microbial culture under continuous flow conditions (Sedran et al. [@CR39]). On the contrary, biodegradation of MtBE in the subsurface was inhibited largely by the presence of ethylbenzenes and xylenes and partially inhibited by benzene and toluene until MtBE had migrated beyond the BTEX plume (Deeb et al. [@CR11]). The preferential utilization of ethanol under aerobic, denitrifying, iron-reducing, sulfate-reducing, and methanogenic conditions resulted in a negative effect on BTEX degradation (Corseuil et al. [@CR9]; Lovanh et al. [@CR31]; Ruiz-Aguilar et al. [@CR36]). Bioaugmentation with a benzene-enriched methanogenic consortium enhanced anaerobic benzene degradation in a mixture of BTEX and ethanol (Da Silva and Alvarez [@CR10]).

The concurrence of MtBE, EtBE, TBA, and benzene may affect the microbial degradation potential for both fossil-based and biobased components. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, studies on the anaerobic degradation of a mixture of MtBE, EtBE, TBA, and benzene have not been reported. In this study, anoxic groundwater from a contaminated location was used to determine the microbial degradation potential for a mixture of benzene, MtBE, EtBE, and TBA, the latter being a degradation product of MtBE and EtBE.

The values of log *K*~*N*~ at 298 K in [Table 2](#tab2){ref-type="table"} are similar to the corresponding values from the titration data ([Table 1](#tab1){ref-type="table"}), which suggests that the assumptions used in fitting the thermal denaturation data are reasonable. The experimental data in [Fig. 6](#fig6){ref-type="fig"} clearly follow the theoretical sigmoidal curve corresponding to the melting transition. The free-bound transitions occur over narrower temperature ranges with increasing *N*, and the point of inflection occurs at higher temperatures. These visual observations are confirmed by the calculated parameters shown in [Table 2](#tab2){ref-type="table"}, which show that the increased binding constants observed for higher values of *N* are associated with an increase in the enthalpy change on duplex formation and with an increase in the transition melting temperature. These features are characteristic of cooperative interactions between the H-bonding sites along the duplex.[@cit10]

Conclusions
===========

We present a general strategy for the design of synthetic information molecules that could potentially encode and replicate chemical information in the same way as nucleic acids. A series of H-bond donor (phenol) and H-bond acceptor (phosphine oxide) oligomers (D~*N*~ and A~*N*~, *N* = 1--4) have been synthesised using reductive amination chemistry. The assembly of duplexes, A~*N*~·D~*N*~, was characterised using NMR titrations and thermal denaturation experiments in toluene. The stability of the

The DM is integrated into the AOSLO as depicted in [Fig. 1](#g001){ref-type="fig"} Fig. 1Schematic diagram of the AOSLO setup. LD: light delivery; PMT: photomultiplier tube; WFS: wavefront sensor; DM: deformable mirror; HS: horizontal scanner; VS: vertical scanner. The optical setup is built along two perpendicular planes to remove astigmatism.. The light delivery (LD) module, through a beam splitter, introduces an 840 nm (50-nm bandwidth) collimated beam in the optical system, reaching the eye after reflecting off the DM, the horizontal scanner (HS) and the vertical scanner (VS). The infrared light comes from a superluminescent diode (Broadlighter S840, Superlum, Russia). The HS and the VS are a resonant scanner and a galvanometric scanner, respectively, manufactured by Electro-Optics Products Corp, Flushing Meadows, NY. The resonant scanner works at 16 kHz producing a sinusoidal scan that is coupled to the galvanometric scanner which generates a sawtooth pattern at 1/525th of the fast scan frequency. The diffusely reflected light from each point of the drawn raster scan on the retina transmits inversely along the ingoing path. Part of this light is then reflected on a beam splitter, focused on a pinhole by means of a collecting lens (L1) and finally detected by a GaAs photo multiplier tube (PMT) (Hamamatsu, Japan). The ideal pinhole diameter is around 20 μm \[[@r35]\] although a 80-μm pinhole was finally chosen to increase throughput. Dedicated software, an electronic module and a frame grabbing board (GenesisLC, Matrox, Canada) convert the detected signal by the PMT into an image of the retina. The rest of light reflected off the retina is used to measure the wavefront error and feed the AO control system that corrects for the aberrations of the eye.

Pairs of spherical mirrors forming 4f systems assure that the eye's pupil, the VS, the HS and the DM planes are optically conjugated. Finally, to relay the wavefront onto the lenslet array in the WFS two achromatic doublets (L2, L3) are used, yielding a 1:1 magnification between the DM and the WFS, as required. The mirror focal lengths are chosen in such a way that the whole aperture

We now discuss these aspects in the "Single-cell eQTL analysis: the new era of population genetics" section:

"Another promising avenue that has become available in recent years to gain increased insights in the link between genetics and disease, is through the use of spatial transcriptomics technologies, including MERFISH, seqFISH+, Slide-seq and 10x Visium^34,\ 35^. While for PBMCs this approach may not be applicable, in solid tissues and organs this extra layer of spatial information is extremely valuable. For example, it can help to disentangle trans-eQTL interactions that are modulated through cell-cell communication (e.g. a SNP affects ligand expression in one cell type, and thereby affects downstream receptor signaling in a second cell type). Despite not having this spatial information available in PBMCs, other approaches that consider receptor-ligand expression pairs do provide insights in potential cell-cell interactions. These approaches have been successfully applied before to uncover how the ligand expression in one cell type can affect the frequency^36^ or the downstream signaling^37^ of another cell type expressing the corresponding receptor."

And in the "Single-cell GRN reconstruction: taking eQTLs one step further" section:"

"Such priors on regulatory interactions can be derived from, for example, ChIP-seq data^57^, ATAC-seq data^58^, spatial information^34,\ 35^ or from perturbation experiments^33,\ 50^."

> 9\. How does the consortium and its work relate to/differ from the following project?

The sc-eQTLGen consortium does currently not yet have its own funding. Therefore, individual groups generate their own funding through other sources such as the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI). Jimmie Ye is one of the PIs that is involved in both this CZI project and the sc-eQTLGen consortium. This CZI project covers just parts of the goals of the sc-eQTLGen consortium (identification of context- and cell type-specific eQTLs, but not reconstruction of personalized, context-specific gene regulatory networks) and is limited to a small number of groups. To truly capture all immune phenotypic variation (genetic and environmental), and being able to study *trans*-effects in a genome-wide fashion, a larger collaborative effort (such as sc-eQTLGen) is required. So both projects are related and will

Maintaining tyre pressure levels is particularly vital for avoiding traffic accidents and prevents wasting fuel caused by faulty tyre air pressure levels; which therefore helps the reduction of carbon emissions. In the US, the government has put in to place legislation in which all new vehicles since September 2007, except those with dual wheels on an axle, have to have a TPMS installed in all its tyres. This is enforced by the National Highways and Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)-(FMVSS No. 138) \[[@b8-sensors-14-10306]--[@b15-sensors-14-10306]\]. Likewise, in the EU from 1st November 2012, all new vehicles must have a TPMS installed (UNECE Vehicle Regulations (Regulation No. 64))\[[@b15-sensors-14-10306]--[@b17-sensors-14-10306]\]. The next paragraph explains the problems associated with powering a tyre monitoring system.

The problems associated with using batteries as the main power supply unit in TPMSs include limited life time, low energy density at extreme temperatures \[[@b18-sensors-14-10306],[@b19-sensors-14-10306]\], energy capacity deterioration associated with high centrifugal loading, shocks and vibration exposure, and the need for frequent replacements \[[@b20-sensors-14-10306],[@b21-sensors-14-10306]\]. The technique used in the proposed TCMS is a clean and perpetual solution to powering sensors by avoiding the use and the need for the toxic and corrosive thionyl chloride chemistry used in TPMS lithium batteries, and subsequently their resulted waste, in which special handling and disposal is required. However, the designed system is active only when the containing tyre is in motion. This property helps by saving energy from being wasted while the vehicle is stationary and accelerates waking up time after starting off.

In general, a TCMS consists of three main units; the power supply unit, sensing unit, and readout circuitry unit as shown in [Figure 1](#f1-sensors-14-10306){ref-type="fig"}. The power supply unit comprises an energy source element which is primarily a battery, and a power monitoring and conditioning circuitry. The sensing unit includes different types of sensors with respect to the properties intended to be measured, e.g., pressure and temperature sensors. The third unit is a programmable element run by a microcontroller. Its function is summarised into handling the system sensors\' input and output signals

To determine whether five common herbivorous fishes preferred turf algae over macro algae, the grazing intensity (i.e., the number of bites taken from either algal group per 5 min) was compared using a factorial ANOVA where fish species and algal type were used as categorizing factors followed by post-hoc analyses (Tukey HSD).

No comparisons were made between the two sites because different experimental treatments were conducted at each site.

Abundance of turf algae {#s3a}
-----------------------

Turf algae were the most abundant living benthic group at five of eight surveyed sites along Curaçao\'s south-western shore ([Figure 2](#pone-0014312-g002){ref-type="fig"}), while macroalgae were most abundant at two sites (Cas Abou and Daaibooi) and coral at only one (Water Factory). Turf algal cover per site ranged between 20.3--41.0% and turf algae were the most abundant living benthic group (28.9%, SD: 7.8, n = 8) across all sites with 1.99 times higher cover than macro algae (14.6%, SD: 12.5, n = 8) and 1.73 times higher cover than corals (16.7%, SD: 9.7, n = 8). Only sand was a more abundant component of the reef bottom (31.1%, SD: 14.2, n = 8) between depths of 7--10 m.

Background {#Sec1}
==========

Ankle sprain is the most common injury in the physically active population and development to chronic ankle instability (CAI) is frequent \[[@CR1]\]. About one out of five osteoarthritic ankles results from lateral ankle sprain \[[@CR1]\]. The role of the mechanical component in CAI is a matter of ongoing debate \[[@CR2]\]. Most studies originating from a kinesiology or sport scientific perspective do not report "a definitive association of ankle laxity with CAI" \[[@CR3]\]. In the orthopaedic literature, however, CAI and mechanical ankle instability (MAI) are often used interchangeably \[[@CR4]--[@CR8]\]. When MAI exceeds a certain amount and functional deficits cannot adequately be restored by conservative approaches, operative interventions have to be taken into consideration. In principle, tenodeses, anatomic reconstructions, and combined procedures are used to stabilize against ligamentous lateral ankle instability \[[@CR9], [@CR10]\]. Repair using local tissue has been shown to effectively stabilize the lateral ankle joint \[[@CR8], [@CR11]\]. Suture tape is a recent development to augment a Brostrom repair at least during the healing phase of the native tissues used for stabilization of the lateral ankle ligaments \[[@CR12], [@CR13]\]. Although there are concerns for progressive elongation of suture-tape, unclear long-term stability (longevity of mechanical stability), and unexpected complications such as foreign body reaction, this procedure is increasingly used for various ligament reconstructions.

A clinical study examined the effectiveness of suture tape to stabilize the ankle against a manually performed anterior drawer test. Results led to the conclusion that using an additional suture tape might be favoured compared to an isolated modified Brostrom repair \[[@CR14]\]. Until now, only three cadaver experiments were published to demonstrate the stability of anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) suture tape augmentation \[[@CR13], [@CR15], [@CR16]\]. These experiments either investigated load to failure of the isolated ATFL \[[@CR13]\], or rotation of the tibia, respective to the calcaneus \[[@CR15], [@CR16]\]. These experiments were designed to only load the ATFL (or the respective reconstructions), and specimens were therefore rigidly fixed to the testing apparatuses. In contrast, our ankle arthrometer applied only low load to the unconstrained heel in an anterior direction. Due to the complex anatomy of the hindfoot, this load is transferred into a complex motion of the calcaneus and the talus

Immunolocalization of MIPS proteins in developing seeds of *Arabidopsis*
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In *Arabidopsis*, it is not clear when InsP~6~ accumulation is initiated during seed development. Two different stages (torpedo and mature) of developing seeds were therefore investigated for localization of AtMIPS proteins with immunoelectron microscopy using a polyclonal antibody raised against AtMIPS2. However, this antibody does not distinguish between the three isoforms of MIPS due to high amino acid sequence homology (\>89%) across the proteins. Indeed, MIPS proteins of another species (*Catharanthus roseus*) were also detected with this antibody ([@bib19]). The immunolocalization data obtained therefore are likely to represent the additive signals of the three AtMIPS proteins which were all expressed in developing siliques. The density of immunogold particles showed a similar frequency between cells in torpedo and mature stages ([Fig. 2](#fig2){ref-type="fig"}). The subcellular localization indicated the presence of immunogold particles mainly in the cytosol of the endosperm ([Fig. 2C, E](#fig2){ref-type="fig"}; arrowheads), with negligible presence in other organelles, cell walls, and membrane structures. Both torpedo and mature stage embryonic cells showed only low background levels of gold particles ([Fig. 2](#fig2){ref-type="fig"}), indicating that AtMIPS proteins appear to be specifically located within the endosperm cytosol.

LFH was first described by Mason, in 1953 \[[@ref5]\], and then reported by Emmett as hamartoma in 1965 \[[@ref7]\]. The term LFH was established in 1969 by Johnson and Bon\[[@ref4]\] figlio \[[@ref4]\]. This rare condition is characterized by infiltration of peripheral nerves by fibrous and adipose tissues. Several names have been used to describe it including fibrolipomatous hamartoma, fibrolipoma, lipofibroma, fibrofatty proliferation, macrodystrophialipomatosa, and intraneural lipoma\[[@ref1]\]. The lack of a single name, along with its rarity, has complicated the diagnosis and the treatment of this condition\[[@ref2]\]. LFH is most commonly found in the median nerve (about 80% of the cases), especially in the carpal tunnel segment, although it is unknown why this predilection occurs\[[@ref4]\]. LFH is the most common condition associated with macrodactyly of the upper extremity; in one-third of the cases reported, macrodactyly is noted in the distal distribution of the involved nerve \[[@ref1], [@ref2]\]. Male and female patients appear to be equally affected with a mean age of 21 years old \[[@ref2]\]. Although the cause of LFH remains unknown, the early age onset has led several physicians to support that LFH is a congenital tumor\[[@ref1], [@ref2]\]. Other authors support that a history of trauma before on set or chronic microtrauma due to repetitive pressure to the median nerve from the carpal ligament or

The performance of the ANFIS network is further investigated. As mentioned previously, the sea conditions continuously change, thus the performance of the network trained on one set of the data degrades with changes in TMS heave frequency and/or amplitude. [Figure 9](#sensors-20-00693-f009){ref-type="fig"}a shows the TMS depth recorded over a 900 s period using the depth sensor sampling frequency $f_{s} = 2$ Hz. Three ANFIS networks, composing of the same structure ($D = 4$, $MF = 2$, $\Delta = 1$), are trained to predict the TMS depth 2.5 s in future ($P = 2.5$).

The first ANFIS network is trained using only the first 100 s of the data, which means that the prediction model of the TMS behavior has been built based only on those measurements. Similar to other neural networks, once a new input data is out of the range the neural network has been trained for, big errors occur. Therefore, as shown in [Figure 9](#sensors-20-00693-f009){ref-type="fig"}b, at time 200 s, between 380 and 420 s, and between 450 and 500 s there is a significant error (blue line). For comparison, the second ANFIS network (red line) has been trained using the first 200 s of the data, therefore it is more "experienced", and has been able to predict the TMS behavior better than the first one. However, a sudden change in TMS depth amplitude between 380 and 420 s, and between 450 and 500 s, still caused high prediction errors. To compensate for this, the ANFIS network should be trained considering the latest available data. With the online ANFIS (green line), the prediction model of the TMS behavior has been recalculated and updated after each TMS depth measurement, using the latest 200 s of the data. For example, at time 380 s the online ANFIS gives approximately the same error as the second ANFIS, however, at time 420 s the prediction error has been significantly reduced. Therefore, at time 450 s based on the last 200 s of "experience", which also includes the depth measurements between 380 and 420 s, the ANFIS already "expects" a sudden change in the TMS depth, thus between 450 and 500 s the prediction error is reduced. In summary, with the online ANFIS training approach the network is

It is a fact that the improvement of physical fitness by pulmonary rehabilitation for COPD patients has the highest evidence (GOLD: grade A). This result is confirmed by many studies in this HTA which observe an improvement of the physical fitness, measured by the six-minutes-walk-test (6MWT).

Some authors demonstrate that early training programmes in out-patient or home-based rehabilitation reduce the health care utilisation.

The majority of follow-up evaluations is done six to twelve months after the end of the rehabilitation programme, in some studies after shorter terms, in a few after 24 or 48 months. One study documents that a 36 month rehabilitation improves the body capacity and can slow down the progression of COPD.

Economic results
----------------

There are varying results concerning the cost-effectiveness of self-management programmes. Some can prove cost-effectiveness, others cannot find a superiority of self-management programmes against usual care.

The included economic studies prove evidence for a reduction of the number and length of hospital treatments which means in fact a cost-benefit for out-patient pulmonary rehabilitation.

Ethical and juridical results
-----------------------------

For pulmonary patients the improvement of the health related quality of life is the main patient reported outcome. The improvement of the health related quality of life is a main benefit of pulmonary rehabilitation as COPD is not reversible. In most of the studies the quality of life is measured by the CRQ or SGRQ. Many studies demonstrate that the health related quality of life can be improved by in-patient as by out-patient pulmonary rehabilitation.

Discussion
----------

The goals of pulmonary rehabilitation like prevention and adequate treatment of acute exacerbations, the minimisation of hospitalisation and the reduction of mortality are attained in out-patient as well as in in-patient pulmonary rehabilitation. Regarding the best frequency of training units per week or the duration and the content of a unit further research is needed. Final results for the ideal length of an in-patient rehabilitation are still missing. The results concerning training and education programmes are not unambiguous. None of the studies deals with the analysis of the different treatment forms of a COPD which are frequently defined by an alteration of in-patient and out-patient treatments and participation in sports clubs or self-help groups. There are some other limitations of the studies. The results concerning self-management programmes are not distinct. (Self-)Selection leads to high drop-out rates. Many studies have only small sample sizes. Confounder and long

In most of the studies that have been conducted so far, pH-dependent binding sites have been engineered by histidine substitutions \[[@b3]--[@b6]\]. The rationale behind this approach is the fact that the histidine side chain has a p*K*~a~ of approximately 6. This means that it is protonated by shifting the pH from neutral to mildly acidic conditions. We hypothesized that a library, which has been constructed by parsimonious mutagenesis, should also cover all histidine mutations. In the initial library, the randomized positions contained approximately 79% of the original nucleotide found in the parental lead Fcab, and 7% of the three other ones, respectively. At the last position of the codons, 86% of the original and 14% of one other nucleotide were present (86%G/14%T or 86%T/14%G or 86%C/14%G). Adenine was excluded in order to minimize the frequency of stop codons. Thus, even if all three nucleotides had to be changed in order to reach a His-codon, this codon should have a frequency of 0.07 × 0.07 × 0.14 = 6.8 × 10^--4^ in the library. Given the library size of 8×10^6^ individual clones, about 5000 Fcab clones (8 × 10^6^ × 6.8 × 10^--4^) would be expected to have this particular His-mutation at the respective position. For positions, where only one or two nucleotide changes were necessary in order to reach the His-codon, this number would even be markedly higher.

Surprisingly, the selected Fcab mutants P2 and P3 did not contain a single histidine-mutation ([Table 1](#tbl1){ref-type="table"}) and in the mutant P1 there was only one His-substitution. However, it should be noted that although the parental clone H10-03-6 did not bind to Her2 in a pH-dependent manner, it contained two histidine residues in the mutated part of the EF-loop ([Table 1](#tbl1){ref-type="table"}). Strikingly, all three pH-dependent Fcab mutants contained a mutation next to the histidine located at the last position of the randomized EF-loop region ([Table 1](#tbl1){ref-type="table"}). Moreover, in P2 there was another mutation next to the second histidine. The accumulation of mutations in the close proximity of

Using the Friedman repeated measures test, we found a significant difference among the four types of examinations for assessing the fund of knowledge (chi-square 16.42, *p* \< 0.001) and clinical abilities (chi-square 14.23, *p* \< 0.01). Post hoc Wilcoxon (Bonferroni corrected) indicated that the structured oral pre-test was ranked significantly higher than the other three examinations on both measures: fund of knowledge (*p* \< 0.01) and clinical abilities (*p* \< 0.01). No other pairwise comparisons among the other three types of examinations were found to be significant. Please see Table [2](#Tab2){ref-type="table"}.

*In vitro* NSC-34 neuron cell culture {#s15}
-------------------------------------

Murine-origin NSC-34 motoneuron cells were purchased from Cellutions Biosystems (Toronto, ON, Canada). High glucose-DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) mixed with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to culture the neurons in a CO~2~ incubator under standard culture conditions as follows: 95% air/5% CO~2~ atmosphere; 37°C temperature. Cells with a passage number of \<30 were used in the present study.

*In vitro* injury model of NSC-34 neurons induced by mechanical scratching {#s16}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our *in vitro* injury model was produced by scratch injury as described earlier with minor modifications ([@B30][@B31]--[@B32]). In brief, NSC-34 neurons were cultured in 12-mm coverslips that were placed in 6-well culture plates by using 10% fetal bovine serum--supplemented DMEM. At 80% cell density, serum that contained DMEM was removed and cells were conditioned with serum-free DMEM for 12 h. To simulate mechanical damage, cells were subsequently subjected to injury by manual scratching (a sum of 4 scratches: 2 scratches vertically and 2 scratches horizontally) by using a 1-ml pipette tip, which produced a total of 9 quadrants. Space between the scratch areas was 2 mm. After injury, medium was removed to get rid of the floated cells, and cells were incubated with fresh serum-free medium for 24 h. Later, serum-free DMEM was discarded, and injured neurons were administered either fresh serum-free DMEM or DMEM that was mixed with H-hPDLSCs-CM (1 mg/ml), and were incubated for 24 h. Neuron cells without scratch injury were also included as control. Afterward, cells were either fixed or harvested for additional studies.

Immunocytochemistry of NSC-34 neuron cells {#s17}
------------------------------------------

To perform immunocytochemical staining, NSC-34 cells that were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde were incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide (Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature for 15 min, followed by blocking with normal horse serum (Vector Laboratories) and Triton X-100 at room temperature for 20 min. Motoneurons were then incubated with the following primary Abs at 4°C overnight: iNOS (1:100; Cell Signaling Technology), COX-

### Clinical characteristics of the cohort

The 189 PCa patients were diagnosed between 1986 and 2001. During this time period in Sweden, PCa diagnoses were mainly confirmed by prostate FNA cytology rather than by performing a multiple-core biopsy of the prostate.^[@bib20]^ Elderly men without lower urinary tract symptoms were seldom tested for their serum PSA levels. The average PSA level at the time of PCa diagnosis was therefore higher during this study than the level currently observed. In this cohort, very few patients had an indolent cancer, over 50% of patients had high-grade, advanced cancer, and hormone therapy was the primary treatment for 77.9% of the patients ([Table 1](#tbl1){ref-type="table"}). With regard to comorbidity, 40% of the patients had cardiovascular disease and 9% diabetes. An internship doctor who was not informed of the results of the molecular analyses collected the relevant clinical data under the supervision of an oncologist. Information with regard to the date of diagnosis, the date of death and the cause of death for all patients was first obtained from regional or national registries and was then verified by examining the medical journals. Diagnosis and cause of death were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD9 and ICD10) recommended by the World Health Organization.^[@bib21]^ PCa-specific mortality was assigned to cases where PCa or metastases were the primary or secondary cause of death. Death causes of patients are described in [Supplementary Table S8](#sup1){ref-type="supplementary-material"}. By 31 December 2008, 22 of the original 189 patients were still alive, 163 were deceased and 4 could not be found in the registries ([Table 1](#tbl1){ref-type="table"}).

### Statistical analysis

Sample size and design of the subsets The details for these procedures are provided in the [Supplementary Information](#sup1){ref-type="supplementary-material"} file. The patient cohort was divided into three subsets, according to the diagnoses and the experimental time order ([Table 1](#tbl1){ref-type="table"}). For Subset 1, we evaluated the strongest candidate genes from the ESCGP list. For Subset 2, we evaluated the most significant genes from Subset 1 and selected genes (reported genes) from the literature. For Subset 3, we tested the genes that demonstrated significance in Subset 2 and a limited number of genes that showed significance in Subset 1 but were not tested in Subset 2. A summary of the genes tested in the different

RESULTS {#sec1-3}

Obese animals had significantly higher body weight than control (44.6 ± 3.5 vs. 24.1 ± 2.7 gr; respectively). Serum hsCRP and IL-6 concentrations were slightly higher in obese mice compared to control, although they were not statistically significant (*P* \> 0.05). Administration of ghrelin did not change serum hsCRP level in control and obese animals (*P* \> 0.05), however, reduced serum IL-6 concentration in obese mice (*P* \< 0.05) \[Figures [1](#F1){ref-type="fig"} and [2](#F2){ref-type="fig"}\].

DISCUSSION {#sec1-4}
==========

Atherosclerosis is a chronic low-grade inflammation status, which is associated with many cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Recently, it is suggested that ghrelin may be involved during atherosclerosis process.\[[@ref2][@ref5]\] Endothelial cells have receptor for ghrelin, suggesting that ghrelin could play a role in cardiovascular disease.\[[@ref10]\] Zhang *et al*. demonstrated that ghrelin has a protective role against atherosclerosis.\[[@ref11]\] However, recently, Habegger *et al*. showed that in LDL receptor-null mice, absence or presence of ghrelin receptor does not alter atherosclerosis in diet-induced obese mice.\[[@ref12]\]

In an *in vitro* study in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), ghrelin inhibited basal and TNF-α and endotoxin-induced cytokine production, and it is suggested that these anti-inflammatory actions of ghrelin play a role in atherosclerosis in obese subjects.\[[@ref5]\] In addition, administration of ghrelin agonist decreased plasma IL-6 concentration in a model of arthritis.\[[@ref13]\] Ghrelin may play a role in atherosclerosis by altering the other factors, which affect this process such as stimulation of NO production,\[[@ref14]\] and it seems that the exact role and mechanism of ghrelin in prevention or treatment of atherosclerosis needs more studies.

Majority of the livestock examined for CE came from Kajiado County. The county is divided into five subcounties: Kajiado Central, Kajiado North, Kajiado East, Kajiado West, and Kajiado South. Sampling was done in two major abattoirs in Kajiado West Subcounty, namely, Kiserian and Keekonyokie, during slaughter days from December 2016 to February 2017 ([Figure 1](#fig1){ref-type="fig"}). A total of 1486 carcasses of livestock were inspected for the presence of hydatid cysts in all organs (lungs, liver, heart, spleen, as well as the kidneys) of the pleural and abdominal cavities. Visual inspection, palpation, and incision were done for all of the organs for the presence and cyst distribution. The lesions were carefully excised from all infected organs. Individual cysts were identified as those that had a continuous cyst wall while multiple cysts had a visibly separate cyst wall even for the calcified cysts. The isolated cysts were packed in clean polythene bags placed in cooler boxes and transported to the parasitology laboratory of the Kenya Medical Research Institute, for examination and further analysis. Cysts were dissected using a sterile scalpel blade and each cyst material was fixed and preserved in 70% Ethanol in individual tubes. The contents of the cysts were examined microscopically for the presence of protoscoleces (PS). Cysts were classified as fertile (with protoscoleces) sterile (fluid-filled without protoscoleces), degenerated (collapsed cyst walls with caseated protoscoleces and soft cheesy debris without calcification), and calcified (hard solid appearance of the ectocyst). All the cysts from the same organ were examined individually to confirm mixed infections.

2.2. DNA Extraction {#sec2.2}
-------------------

DNA was obtained from cyst material and protoscoleces by lysing in 0.02 M NaOH at 99°C for 10 minutes. In a few instances where the above process failed to yield adequate DNA, genomic DNA was extracted using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit® (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The germinal layers or cyst walls were cut into small pieces and lysed in ATL lysis buffer (180 *μ*l) and proteinase K (20 *μ*l), and DNA was subsequently extracted using the manufacturer\'s protocol. Extracted DNA was eluted in 50 *μ*L of el

Despite the determined positive role of antioxidants in cellular and animal studies, literature data are conflicting. Many antioxidant supplements such as vitamin E and β-carotene are ineffective even disappointing in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in clinical trials.^[@R3]^ In a study, β-carotene was applied for prevention of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation in atherosclerotic processing, but it showed an inverse association between serum β-carotene levels and coronary heart disease risk. In a view, the epidemiologic evidence does generally support the idea that a diet high in carotenoid- rich foods is associated with a reduced risk of heart disease. What is the possible confounding factor between the trials and epidemiologic evidence? Why do not agree the trials and epidemiologic studies?

It seems our knowledge around the molecular mechanism of carotenoids is at the toddling stage yet. According to the cardiovascular studies, results from intervention trials indicate that supplemental β-carotene enhances the risk of developing lung cancer and in turn mortality among smokers.^[@R4]^ A feasible mechanism which can explain the contrastive role of carotenoids either as beneficial or harmful agents in cancer is that their excess or deficiency may trigger changes in molecular pathways involved in cell stress signaling.^[@R5]^ Their ability to modify the expression of transcription factors depends on several factors such as carotenoid concentration, determined action of multiple micronutrients, cell type, and redox status. Nevertheless, numerous gaps still exist in our comprehension of the role of carotenoids as modulators of cell signaling.

Improved knowledge of the role of carotenoids in signaling pathway *in vitro* and *in vivo* will assist us in understanding their prospective role in health and disease. Then, search for a new class of antioxidants targeting the specific subcellular locales, and the phenotype-genotype association analysis for oxidative stress will likely be avenues for future research in this realm.^[@R6]^ Therefore, the search for novel effective antioxidant therapies in mainstream medicine is possible and promising, however it demands significant advances in basic molecular cell biology, pharmacology, and nutrigenomics as well as clinical bioanalysis.

Reliable evidence indicate that carotenoids, and their metabolites, might modulate molecular pathways related with cell proliferation, acting at Akt, tyrosine kinases, mitogen activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) and growth factor signaling cascades.^[@R7]^ With emerging evidence, it is now obvious that carotenoids confer their activities by regulating the expression of genes and microRNAs.^[@R8]^ MicroRNAs have granted

Case Report
===========

A 63-year-old female was brought to the emergency room for a head trauma after slipping and falling down. She had experienced brief loss of consciousness that lasted for 3 minutes; but later, she could not remember what had happened. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain taken at the emergency room revealed a small amount of SAH in the left ambient cistern ([Figure 1A](#F1){ref-type="fig"}). The SAH was considered to be of traumatic origin. There was no definite focal neurological deficit at the initial evaluation except for mild dullness. She was hospitalized for close observation and conservative care.

She recovered from dullness at the hospital on day 1 and showed no neurological deterioration. An electroencephalogram, an echocardiogram, and Holter monitoring were performed to determine the cause of her sudden collapse. There was no specific finding from those tests. However, on day 3 at the hospital, she complained of diplopia, which was intensified on downward gaze. A neurological evaluation revealed trochlear nerve palsy on the left side ([Figure 2](#F2){ref-type="fig"}). Although a follow-up CT evaluation showed resolution of the SAH, the diplopia showed no definite improvement ([Figure 1B](#F1){ref-type="fig"}). She was discharged from the hospital on day 5 with stable condition except for the diplopia.

A brain MRI was performed 20 days after the trauma using a 3.0 Tesla MRI (Achieva 3.0T; Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands). After acquisition of conventional T2-weighted images in the axial and coronal planes, high-resolution 3D imaging was performed for detection of the cranial nerve (volume isotropic turbo-spin-echo acquisition technique, repetition time 10.5; echo time 5.3, 0.3 mm thickness). The MRI showed continuity of the left trochlear nerve without any change in contour. However, it was abutted by the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) branch at the brain stem ([Figure 3](#F3){ref-type="fig"}). No aneurysm or other vascular abnormality was detected in the brain MRI. There was no definite enhancement of the trochlear nerve.

On follow-up ophthalmological examination 1 month after trauma, there was no definite improvement in the trochlear nerve palsy. It was slightly improved at 2 months after trauma and completely resolved at 5 months after trauma ([Figure 4](#F4

A 20-year-old man was admitted with fever, chills, dry cough, right flank pain, and oliguria. Physical examination showed a palpable mass in the right flank. Laboratory analysis was notable for a creatinine clearance = 59 mL/min per 1.73 m^2^. Tuberculin skin test was 8 mm; human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology was negative. Urinalysis showed sterile pyuria, but microscopy showed acid fast bacilli. The plain abdominal X-ray film showed silence of the right kidney ([Figure 1](#F1){ref-type="fig"}). The chest X-ray showed a fibrocavity infiltrate with small nodules in the right upper lung ([Figure 2](#F2){ref-type="fig"}). The abdominal and pelvic magnetic resonance showed significant dilation of the right pyelocaliceal system and proximal ureter, with thickening of its middle one-third and amorphous retroperitoneal images in the pericaval space with maximum measures of 2.5 × 8.5 cm, consistent with grouped lymph nodes ([Figure 3](#F3){ref-type="fig"}). Biopsies of the renal cortex and retroperitoneal lymph nodes showed caseous granulomas consistent with tuberculosis (TB). Treatment was started with rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, and the patient was left with chronic kidney disease (creatinine clearance after TB treatment = 61 mL/min per 1.73 m^2^). The genitourinary system is often affected in TB resulting from hematogenous spread from primary pulmonary TB.[@R1] Urogenital TB is suspected particularly with sterile pyuria.[@R2],[@R3] Renal dysfunction may result from direct infection of the kidney parenchyma orureteral obstruction with resultant hydronephrosis.

The hydrodynamic diameter, obtained by dynamic light scattering (DLS), and the zeta potential of the QDs were measured with a Malvern 4700 system (Malvern instruments Limited, UK) at 15 nM in water, RPMI-1640 medium with and without 1% or 10% horse serum, and DMEM with or without 2%, 10%, and 15% fetal bovine serum at 37°C. Data are presented as the average of 30 readings (10 readings per replicate).

The QDs were prepared for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) by placing a drop of suspended QDs onto a copper grid coated with a holey carbon support film (Agar Scientific Ltd) and plunge frozen in liquid ethane followed by freeze drying preserving the original features of the QDs ([@kfv002-B13]). Images were subsequently captured. Images were collected by an FEI Tecnai TF20 FEG-TEM operating at 200 kV fitted with a Gatan Orius SC600A camera and an Oxford Instruments INCA 350 energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) system with an 80 mm^2^ X-Max SDD detector.

### Cellular Uptake Studies

#### ImageStream analysis

Treated cells were harvested and FACS fixed (BD Biosciences, UK) for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were passed through the ImageStream imaging flow cytometer (Amnis Corporation) and fluorescence was measured at 488 and 633 nm. All experiments were conducted in duplicate and 5000 cells were acquired for each replicate. Data were analyzed using the Ideas v5 software (Amnis Corporation).

#### Transmission electron microscopy

For cellular uptake studies, samples were prepared as previously described ([@kfv002-B12]). Briefly, the treated cells were harvested and placed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde fixative. Thin sections (\>70 nm) were cut from the polymerized block using an ultra-microtome (Leica Microsystems, EM UC7). TEM was conducted as previously described ([@kfv002-B12]) on a FEI Tecnai F20 operating at 200 kV and fitted with a Gatan Orius SC600A CCD camera for imaging and an Oxford Instruments X-Max SD detector for EDX analysis.

### pH Effect on QD Stability

The effect of different pH levels on the fluorescence of these NPs was also investigated. QDs were incubated in 10% horse serum mixed with PBS and pH levels were adjusted to

Using a glycan array, it was determined that Sfrs1 bound a series of fucosylated oligosaccharides, including H-type 1, H-type 2, LeX, LeY, and LeB structures ([@ref20]). Sfrs1 also exhibited strong binding to α-rhamnose (6-deoxy-mannose); this was rationalized in terms of the structural similarity of this saccharide to fucose (6-deoxy-galactose). These results provoke questions and investigations at several levels. First, do other members of the SR protein family also bind carbohydrates? Second, what is the structural basis for the observed carbohydrate-binding activity of Sfrs1? Finally, since it was reported that Sfrs1 requires calcium for binding to saccharides, is there a calcium-dependent CRD as seen in the C-type lectins ([@ref76])?

The carbohydrate-binding specificity of various purified galectins has been studied extensively and interpreted in terms of the three-dimensional structures which have been determined for CRDs derived from galectin-1 (Gal1), galectin-2, Gal3, galectin-7, and galectin-10 (see [@ref39] for an overview). The CRDs all show a highly conserved tight fold, with two anti-parallel β-pleated sheets forming a sandwich-like structure ([@ref55]). Amino acid side chains on one of these sheets form the core carbohydrate-binding site; the highly conserved residues responsible for saccharide-binding include H158, N160, R162, N174, W181, E184, and R186 (residue numbering from the human Gal3 sequence as reported in [@ref60]).

The composite picture derived from ligand binding and structural studies suggests that the binding site is composed of at least four subsites, each of which interacts with a single monosaccharide unit ([@ref38]; [@ref33]; [@ref27]). More recently, this has been refined to six subsites (designated as A, B, C, D, D′, and E) by [@ref63], who conducted a detailed dose--response analysis of the binding of Gal1, galectin-2, and Gal3 to a microarray containing hundreds of structurally diverse glycans. The major and most conserved feature in the interaction of a galectin polypeptide with saccharides is the binding of a galactose residue in subsite C. This includes direct interaction of the

Several studies have reported that an antigenic protein with a MW of approximately 30 kDa is present in *Blastocystis* organisms \[[@CR17], [@CR46]\] and differences in reactivity to this protein(s) between symptomatic patients and healthy controls have been reported \[[@CR17], [@CR47]\]. No reactivity with proteins of this size was reported in sera from patients with other parasitic infections suggesting the 30 kDa protein might be specific for *Blastocystis* organisms. A cytopathic monoclonal antibody, MAb1D5, previously shown to bind to the external surface of *Blastocystis* sp. \[[@CR32]\], reacts with a30kDa protein from *Blastocystis* isolates derived from humans (ST's unknown), but reportedly not with antigen derived from WR1 \[[@CR24]\]. Peptide sequences derived from material obtained by 2-dimensional electrophoresis and Western blotting suggest that this 30 kDa protein is closely related to a cysteine protease of the legumain type. Although no reactivity of the MAb1D5 was reported previously with subtype WR1 \[[@CR24]\],and this was the subtype we used as an antigen source in our study, the 27 kDa protein-reactivity that we observed more frequently in the symptomatic group may nevertheless correspond to this previously described 30 kDa protein. The difference in reactivity may be accounted for by increased purity of MAb1D5 used in our study and differences in antigen preparation technique, and the MW size difference accounted for by differences in *Blastocystis* antigen source and preparation (e.g., subtype, level of glycosylation). The MAb1D5 tested in parallel with our human serum samples reacted strongly with a double band around 100 kDa MW and also with a 27 kDa protein in the Western blots (Fig. [4](#Fig4){ref-type="fig"}). This pattern of reactivity (100 and \~30 kDa) against an antigen preparation using ST7 organisms was shown previously \[[@CR27]\] and suggests that the 30 kDa antigen may be a processed or degraded form of the 100 kDa protein.

We also noted differences in IBS patients (IBS-P and IBS-N) with regard to reactivity to 50 and 75-95 kDa proteins. These proteins may correspond to the 50 and 118 kDa antigens \[[@CR17]\], or the 60-100 kDa sized proteases \[[@CR48]\] reported previously in symptomatic *Blastocystis* infected patients. Parasitic proteases are known

This was the first study to evaluate mTOR, ZEB1, and ROCK1 expression in the lung tissues of pulmonary fibrosis patients. We evaluated the expression of mTOR, ZEB1, and ROCK1 proteins in the lung tissue, along with clinical parameters such as radiological honeycombing score, histological fibrosis score, pulmonary function, and patient survival rate. The expression of mTOR, ZEB1, and ROCK1 was increased in most of the lung tissues of pulmonary fibrosis patients. The expression of mTOR and ZEB1 significantly correlated with the fibrosis score and pulmonary function change. During the follow-up period, there were no fatalities in the patient group with undetectable mTOR or ZEB1 expression. However, ROCK1 expression was not associated with the assessed clinicopathologic features.

In clinical settings, mTOR inhibitors are used as immunosuppressants to prevent graft rejection. Activated mTOR complex regulates cell cycle and therefore, treatment with mTOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin, leads to cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. The key immunosuppression mechanism of mTOR inhibitors is to block clonal proliferation and expansion of stimulated lymphocytes. However, mTOR inhibitors also block proliferation of other cell types such as vascular smooth muscle cells, mesangial cells, and endothelial cells and have anti-fibrotic activity \[[@CR12]\]. The anti-fibrotic effects of mTOR inhibition have been reported in various rat models of diabetic nephropathy, glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and liver cirrhosis \[[@CR13]--[@CR16]\]. In the murine pulmonary fibrosis model, rapamycin treatment resulted in reduced lung collagen deposition \[[@CR3], [@CR17], [@CR18]\]. However, the role of mTOR in human pulmonary fibrosis has not been evaluated.

In our study, expression of mTOR was increased in most of the UIP lung tissues and significantly correlated with the fibrosis score and pulmonary function change. Thus, mTOR expression may be related to the prognosis of pulmonary fibrosis. mTOR was mainly expressed in the alveolar epithelial cells of pulmonary fibrosis patients. The alveolar epithelial cells have a crucial role in pathogenesis of IPF. Repetitive microinjuries to the alveolar epithelium drive a pathogenic cascade of IPF. Activated alveolar epithelial cells stimulate fibroblasts to secrete various profibrotic cytokines \[[@CR19]\]. mTOR expression in the alveolar epithelial cells indicates that mTOR may play a role in the pathogenesis of IPF by promoting alveolar epithelial cell proliferation. Although mesenchymal cells such as fibroblasts or myofibroblasts rarely expressed mTOR in our study, a previous study showed that an mTOR inhibitor

The two classes of NPC-localized proteasomes likely perform nonredundant functions. The basket-tethered class is optimally positioned to encounter soluble proteins transiting the NPC's central channel. Similarly, the membrane-tethered proteasomes are in an ideal location to encounter membrane proteins traveling through the NPC's peripheral channels. Therefore, one plausible function for both classes is the surveillance of NPC traffic ([Fig. 5](#fig05){ref-type="fig"}). The INM is continuous with the outer nuclear membrane (ONM) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and membrane proteins with sufficiently small extraluminal domains can freely diffuse across the NPC ([@r36]). Thus, the INM requires a quality control mechanism to maintain its distinct identity. In *S. cerevisiae*, the Asi E3 ubiquitin ligase mediates a specialized branch of ER-associated degradation (ERAD), destroying mislocalized membrane proteins that reach the INM ([@r37], [@r38]). The membrane-tethered proteasomes may participate in this specialized ERAD, encircling the NPCs to form an INM quality control checkpoint.

![Proposed quality control functions for proteasomes at the NPC. Basket-tethered and membrane-tethered proteasomes may perform surveillance of transiting soluble and membrane proteins, respectively (blue). The abundant NPC-tethered proteasomes could also serve as a degradation center where nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins are sent for destruction (pink). This degradation center may also function in transcriptional control.](pnas.1716305114fig05){#fig05}

The high proteasome concentration at NPCs might additionally enable this region to function as a degradation center where unneeded proteins are sent for recycling ([Fig. 5](#fig05){ref-type="fig"}). Existing nuclear import and export signals could be coopted to target substrates to the NPC-tethered proteasomes. While the targeting of nuclear proteins seems more practical as it does not require passage through the NPC, numerous proteins have also been shown to undergo nuclear import for degradation ([@r1], [@r39], [@r40]). The NPC-tethered proteasomes may also degrade kinetochore components, as the localization of proteasomes to the nuclear envelope is required for maintaining correct kinetochore stoichiometry in *S. pombe* ([@r13]). In addition, some regions of transcriptionally

The utility of fine needle aspiration cytology can be enhanced by the collection of cell blocks for immunohistochemistry and other molecular studies. We describe a method for making vapour fixed cell blocks that we have developed over the last 10 years. This technique, which we refer to as 'The Poor Man\'s Cell Block,' requires no equipment or reagents that are not available in an outpatient department or a radiology department. It has developed from a method that we first described in 2003.[@b1] The material is expelled from the fine needle aspiration needle to form a blob on the inside of the inverted lid of a universal container ([figure 1](#fig1){ref-type="fig"}). Sometimes the specimen is expelled as several blobs. These can be shepherded back into a single larger blob by an 'air-football' technique using puffs of air from the now empty needle and syringe. The lid is left inverted while a ball of tissue paper is pushed into the bottom of the universal container. A small amount of formalin, about 2 ml, is added to the container and soaks into the tissue paper. Alternatively one can push two isopropyl alcohol phlebotomy swabs into the bottom of the container. The container is screwed on to the inverted lid. The container is then left in the inverted position for at least 6 h at room temperature. By this time, the specimen has been fixed by the vapour and has become solid. It can be prised off the lid of the container with the edge of a scalpel and processed as if it were a biopsy. The specimen is best removed by first flooding the lid with a small amount of formalin so as to gently break the 'limpet' suction between the specimen and the lid. It is important not to let the specimen dry out once it has been removed from the lid, as this makes the specimen hard to section and causes cellular artefact. It should be cassetted and immersed in formalin as soon as possible. The use of isopropyl alcohol swabs is arguably preferable to the use of formalin, as handling formalin is considered to be more hazardous, and isopropyl alcohol vapour appears to fix the cell block more rapidly than formalin vapour. In addition, formalin vapour fixation may give rise to prominent formalin pigment. However, alcohol fixation of any type of cytology specimen should not be used without regard for the changes in immunohistochemical methods that are then required. Formalin-fixed control sections are no longer appropriate, and different antigen retrieval methods may be needed. For this

Centrin is an essential 20 kD EF-hand calcium-binding protein similar to calmodulin but possessing a helical N-terminal extension, which is critical for its capacity to self-assemble \[[@B49-cells-07-00079]\]. Just as with calmodulin, centrin is a calcium sensor, which changes its conformation in response to calcium binding. It is involved in a variety of processes ranging from nucleotide excision repair to the regulation of dynein arm activity \[[@B50-cells-07-00079]\]. Centrin is ubiquitously found in centrosomal structures, including those of organisms which lack basal bodies and centrioles, such as budding yeast, which replicates its spindle pole body using the centrin homologue CDC31 \[[@B51-cells-07-00079]\]. The assembly of centrin fibers often involves Sfi1p, which possesses multiple centrin-binding domains \[[@B51-cells-07-00079],[@B52-cells-07-00079]\]. Centrin-decorated Sfi1p fibers are thought to resemble a beaded string, which at elevated calcium concentrations will coil resulting in the shortening of the fibers \[[@B53-cells-07-00079]\]. Centrin was first isolated from purified rhizoplasts, massive linkers between the basal bodies and the cell nucleus present in some prasinophytes (a subgroup of green algae), which were already observed by early light microscopists more than a 100 years ago \[[@B54-cells-07-00079]\].

In *C. reinhardtii*, centrin, originally named caltractin, was identified during a search for calmodulin-like calcium-binding proteins based on the calcium-induced shift in its electrophoretic mobility \[[@B55-cells-07-00079],[@B56-cells-07-00079]\]. Centrin is present in the nucleus-basal body connectors (NBBCs) linking each basal body to the cell nucleus, the distal connecting fiber interconnecting the two mature basal bodies, and the stellate structure of the TZ linking the axonemal doublets to each other ([Figure 3](#cells-07-00079-f003){ref-type="fig"}) \[[@B57-cells-07-00079]\]. Furthermore, small centrin filaments are present between the nascent and mature basal bodies and inside the basal bodies; luminal centrin fibers are early markers of the circumferential asymmetry of the probasal bodies \[[@B58-

In this study, we found that some antibiotic compounds, such as prodigiosin, mitomycin, and dactinomycin, had partial activity against stationary phase *B. burgdorferi*, although their activities (24%--30% residual viable cells) are not as strong as daptomycin (18% residual viable cells) ([Table 1](#tbl1){ref-type="table"}). Prodigiosin is a secondary metabolite of *Serratia marcescens* and has antibacterial, antifungal, antiprotozoal, antimalarial, immunosuppressive, and anticancer activities.^[@bib31]^ Mitomycin shows its activity as a DNA cross-linker through its aziridine functional group and cross-links the complementary strands of the DNA double helix to cause the death of a bacterial cell.^[@bib32],[@bib33]^ The activity of mitomycin against stationary phase *B. burgdorferi* may be due to its DNA cross-linking activity. Dactinomycin is a polypeptide antitumor antibiotic isolated from the soil bacteria *Streptomyces*,^[@bib34]^ and it binds DNA and interferes with DNA replication^[@bib34]^ and also inhibits RNA transcription.^[@bib35]^

Persisters are heterogeneous and include persisters in the stationary phase, which can grow after antibiotic exposure and those that survive antibiotic treatment *in vivo* but cannot grow (viable but non-culturable) in a continuum.^[@bib36]^ Thus, the use of stationary phase cultures as a surrogate of persisters in this study has limitations because they cannot represent the viable but non-culturable persisters that have been found *in vivo* in different animal models after antibiotic treatment.^[@bib5],[@bib6],[@bib7]^ Nevertheless, the discovery of the drug candidates with activity against *B. burgdorferi* stationary phase cultures from this study and our previous study^[@bib12],[@bib14]^ offers the opportunity to assess whether such drugs are useful for eradicating persistent infection *in vivo* in animal models and in patients in future studies.

In summary, we identified the anthracycline class of compounds including daunomycin, daunomycin 3-oxime, dimethyldaunomycin, NSC299187, NSC363998, and nogalamycin along with some other compounds, including prodigiosin, mitomycin, nanaomycin, and dactinomycin, as having excellent activity against both the non-growing stationary phase and growing *B. burgdorferi*

Mice, Immunizations and Colonization {#S3}
------------------------------------

Mice harboring the *Rag2-Gfp* knock-in fusion gene at the endogenous locus were described previously^[@R15]^ and were maintained on a 129/SvJ background. Wild type Balb/c mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Swiss-Webster germ-free mice were purchased from Taconic Farms. For each germ-free/colonization experiment, littermate germfree mice were used as controls. Germ-free status and colonization status were confirmed by gram staining of cecal and small intestinal contents as well as microbial culture. Immunization experiments were performed with alum as described^[@R18]^. All experiments with mice followed the protocols approved by the Boston Animal Care Facility of the Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115.

Cell Isolation and Flow Cytometry {#S4}
---------------------------------

PP, IEL and LP lymphocytes were isolated essentially as described^[@R27]^. PPs were excised from the small intestine, and the remaining tissue was incubated with 1×Hank's balanced salt solution with 1 mM EDTA/10% FBS/PBS for 30 min and room tempuratur three times for IEL extraction. Residual intestinal tissue was digested in 20% FBS RPMI with 0.05% collagenase from Clostridium histolyticum (Sigma) for 1 hr at 37 degrees Celsius three times. IELs and LP cells were centrifuged over Lympholyte (Cedar Lane) per manufacturer's recommendations to minimize mucus contamination. Single-cell suspensions of mLNs, PPs and spleen were prepared by mashing through a cell strainer (70 µm). Cells were stained with fluorophore-conjugated mouse antibodies, and flow cytometry was performed.

The following API kits were used for testing, API Coryne, API 20NE and API 20E (bioMérieux,). Each test was interpreted according to the manufacturer's instructions. Biolog tests were performed to investigate which compounds the strains in question could use for respiration. A GP2 MicroPlate (Cat. No 1014; Biolog), containing 95 different carbon compounds, was used to test for substrate oxidation. The chemistry of these plates is based on tetrazolium reduction, in response to metabolic processes such as fermentation and oxidation. Tetrazolium reduction produced formazan in a variety of colours from dark blue to deep red to orange, depending upon the original tetrazolium salt used as the substrate for the reaction. MicroPlates were inoculated and interpreted according to the manufacturer's instructions. The results were recorded after 12 h based on *A*~585~. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using the disc-diffusion method in which the antibiotic diffuses away from the disc in two dimensions, forming a concentration gradient that inhibits the growth of bacteria and causes an inhibition zone (Piddock, 1990). The results were interpreted according to the criteria established for staphylococci in 1997 by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (2000). At the concentrations assayed, the inhibition zone caused by streptomycin was 157 mm, rifampicin 347 mm, chloramphenicol 340 mm, kanamycin 150 mm and tetracycline 157 mm and thus it could be concluded that strain 4J27^T^ was susceptible to all the antibiotics tested. The phenotypic differences between strain 4J27^T^ and closely related species are summarized in [Table 1](#t1){ref-type="table"} and the physiological differences between strain 4J27^T^ and its closest relative species [*Arthrobacter phenanthrenivorans*](http://dx.doi.org/10.1601/nm.13221) DSM 18606^T^ are summarized in Table S1.

Mitochondrial diseases form a highly diverse group with variable clinical symptoms and different ages of onset. They are predominantly monogenic disorders and recent advances in sequencing technologies have revolutionized the diagnosis of patients with mitochondrial diseases. Despite these advances, the genotype--phenotype correlations remain difficult to predict. The large heterogeneity of the human genome makes functional validation of novel disease variants essential.^\[[@R24],[@R25]\]^

Clearly common disease alleles in mitochondrial disease are due to mutation in nuclear genes, which are important to maintain our mitochondrial DNA^\[[@R26]\]^ with an estimated prevalence of pathogenic nuclear DNA mutations in a northeast England study on adults with symptomatic mitochondrial disease of 2.9 per 100,000 compared with 20 per 100,000 for the pathogenic mtDNA mutations.^\[[@R27]\]^ A Spanish study found an estimated prevalence of 5.7 per 100,000 for mitochondrial diseases in a population over 14 years of age.^\[[@R28]\]^

Statistical analysis was performed on a final cohort of 56 patients. The mean age was 58 years, with a male predominance of 80.4%. The most common aetiology of cirrhosis was alcoholic cirrhosis (*n* = 27), followed by viral hepatitis (*n* = 10), primary biliary sclerosis (*n* = 5), cryptogenic cirrhosis (*n* = 4), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (*n* = 2), autoimmune hepatitis (*n* = 1), and those with a combination of the above-mentioned aetiologies (*n* = 7). The most common indication for TIPS was refractory ascites (*n* = 34), followed by variceal bleeding (*n* = 15) and recurrent hydrothorax (*n* = 4).

Predictors of post-TIPS hepatic encephalopathy {#sec3.2}
----------------------------------------------

Fifty (89.2%) patients were sarcopaenic. In our patient population, the overall rate of development of HE after TIPS procedure was noted to be 32 per 100 patients (*n* = 18). In the sarcopaenic group, 36 per 100 patients (*n* = 18) developed HE within 6 months of their TIPS procedure, in comparison to no patients in the non-sarcopaenic group.

The mean age of the patients who developed HE (mean: 60.1) was higher than in patients who did not develop HE (mean: 57.4) (*p* = 0.349).

The mean MELD-Na score for those who developed HE within 6 months post-TIPS was 15.6, compared to a mean of 15.1 in the group who did not develop HE within 6 months of the TIPS (*p* = 0.731).

Pre-TIPS albumin levels were lower in patients with sarcopaenia (mean: 2.9), as compared to those who were not sarcopaenic (mean: 3.1). There appeared to be linear correlation between serum albumin levels and PMA (correlation coefficient *r* = 0.244, *p* = 0.069); however, the difference was not statistically significant. Among the patients who were sarcopaenic, the mean albumin in the group that developed HE was also lower at 2.8 (compared to 3.0) in those who

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a pathologic hyperinflammatory syndrome resulting from over-activation of CD8 + cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL\'s) and benign macrophages with marked release of inflammatory cytokines, ultimately resulting in tissue invasion of the liver, spleen, and/or lymph nodes. Primary HLH is a genetic disorder arising from defects in the cytotoxic pathway whereas, secondary HLH may arise in the background of various disorders, including infection, malignancy, rheumatory disease, or metabolic conditions. Secondary HLH has been reported as a paraneoplastic syndrome, predominantly in hematolymphoid malignancies, and is rarely associated with non-hematolymphoid neoplasms. In this report, we describe a case of HLH associated with an ovarian dysgerminoma, which to the best of our knowledge represents the first such case in the reported literature.

A 41-year-old women (gravida 1, para 1) presented with a progressively enlarging pelvic mass and menorrhagia. Imaging studies suggested the presence of uterine leiomyomata. Depot Lupron injections were given in an attempt to reduce the size of the presumed leiomyomas. Following the injection, the patient developed diffuse redness and itching, improving with oral prednisone, but subsequently worsening with diffuse erythema, hyperpigmented macules, increased scaling, and desquamation. Skin biopsies showed findings consistent with drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). The Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (RegiSCAR) inclusion criteria for DRESS syndrome include acute rash, fever \> 38 °C, internal organ involvement like transaminitis, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia with eosinophilia, and negative investigative results supporting alternative.

The patient underwent repeat imaging studies, showing further increase in the size of the pelvic mass. These findings prompted the decision to proceed with surgical removal of the mass. However, prior to the planned surgery, the patient developed fever and tachycardia, requiring admission to the hospital for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Laboratory testing revealed significant abnormalities, including neutropenia (WBC = 0.8 \[4.0--11.0 K/μL\]), low absolute neutrophil count (ANC = 0.05 \[1.7--6.7 K/μL\]), anemia (hemoglobin = 10.3 \[11.7--15.7

DH, as a specific and reversible ChEI, increases the acetylcholine concentration in the cholinergic synapses^[@CR4]^. Despite its therapeutic effects, it has various side effects, such as nausea and diarrhea, after oral administration^[@CR5]^. Also, drug delivery to AD is limited, due to the blood brain barrier (BBB), restricting the brain penetration of 98 and 100% of small and large molecule drugs, respectively^[@CR6]^. To overcome these issues, hydrogel-based drug delivery systems and drug delivery through nasal route seem to be appropriate.

Nasal mucosa is characterized by high vascularization, large absorptive surface area, and the rapid onset of action^[@CR4]^. Moreover, this route is an alternative, non-invasive, and painless technique for circumventing the BBB and delivering therapeutics to CNS^[@CR4]^.

Also, hydrogels are cross-linked 3-dimensional (3D) networks, biocompatible with biological systems, and able to absorb the high content of water^[@CR7]^. Most hydrogels are bio- and muco-adhesive^[@CR8]^ and improve drugs bioavailability more than conventional oral drug delivery systems through increasing the contact time between the drug and absorption site^[@CR9]^. Therefore, hydrogels appear promising for brain drug delivery through nasal route^[@CR10]^.

In this study, various hydrogels formulations were designed, and after characterization, thiolated chitosan hydrogel (TCH) was selected for incorporation with liposomal DH (LDH) for the intranasal delivery of DH as an anti-Alzheimer drug in rabbits. In this regard, various pharmacokinetic parameters, including the mean peak drug concentration (C~max~), time to reach C~max~ (T~max~), and area under the curve (AUC) of the drug were evaluated. LDH incorporated into TCH could considerably contribute to the development of efficacious system for DH brain delivery, due to its promising properties. This formulation is a novel approach, reported for the first time for the brain delivery of DH which might result in the development of an innovative therapy for AD treatment.

There were 42 patients (19%) who had falling CA125 levels at the time of RECIST PD. It is not recorded whether any of these had a fall in CA 125 sufficient to be classified as responding according to GCIG criteria. Again one would expect some patients to have fluctuating or even falling levels at the time of RECIST-defined PD as the latter is an arbitrary surrogate measure. Furthermore, we and others have noted that CA125 levels can fall in some terminally ill patients, which would include many with progressive platinum-resistant disease. As Bowtell\'s group have observed several molecular events associated with acquired resistance of high-grade serous ovarian cancer, it would be no surprise if CA125 expression was also reduced in some patients under the selective pressure of CT \[[@MDW253C7]\].

There is increasing concern that therapy should not necessarily be stopped based purely on progression according to RECIST as particularly with biological therapies, the rate of tumour growth could still be slower on that therapy than if it was stopped \[[@MDW253C8]\]. Lindemann et al. correctly state that a major role of therapy in platinum-resistant disease is palliation of symptoms. The randomised trial data showing no benefit from earlier reintroduction of CT just because of rising CA125 levels should persuade oncologists to delay CT for recurrent ovarian cancer until they develop symptoms \[[@MDW253C6]\]. Most oncologists would use the palliation of those symptoms as a good guide to the effectiveness of the therapy. Better objective measurement of symptom control is also leading to an increasing interest in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) as an end point in clinical trials involving these patients \[[@MDW253C9]\]. The use of PROs in the Aurelia trial showed that the use of bevacizumab significantly improved abdominal symptoms \[[@MDW253C10]\].

So how should the paper of Lindemann et al. effect the way we use CA125 in patients with PROC? In clinical trials, it remains reasonable to continue using a CA125 level ≥twice the upper limit of normal within 2 weeks as eligibility criteria and to use GCIG CA125 criteria as part of the multimodal response assessments, particularly if including patients without RECIST-evaluable disease. It seems reasonable to continue therapy if there is a response according to GCIG CA125 criteria. Future validation is required before GCIG CA125 criteria are used to define PD. A change of therapy particularly in patients with PROC should not be based just on rising CA125 levels. Most patients will continue to

Introduction {#SECID0EWG}
============

The story of studying and describing B chromosomes (Bs) dates back to 1907, when Edmund [@B17], working on hemipteran chromosomes, noticed those that appeared to be additional to the main karyotype and were present only in a fraction of individuals. However, the term 'B chromosome' was only established 11 years later. In 1928, Lowell Fitz Randolph working on variation in maize chromosomes proposed to call stable chromosomes of the standard complement 'A chromosomes', and those coming additional to the standard complement and being variable in number and morphology, 'B chromosomes' ([@B11]). B chromosomes were discovered very early in the history of cytogenetics. By 2004, Bs have been found in 55 of 4629 living species of mammals ([@B15]).

[@B12] suggest several models of B chromosome origin, while the article by [@B16], provides an updated list of 85 mammalian species with Bs, and gives a detail description of research experiments accomplished on these species. The research article by ([@B9]) provides novel data on B chromosome content and evolution in the red fox (the first mammalian species with Bs, whose genome has recently been sequenced and assembled ([@B8]), and in the raccoon dog, the carnivore species, where B specific coding genes were discovered almost 13 years ago. Using new generation sequencing, the authors argue that the origin of B chromosome in these species is independent. Through the analysis of B content in different mammals they conclude a frequent and independent re-use of the same genomic regions in B chromosome formation. They suggest that such a re-use may be connected with gene functions. By definition, these chromosomes are not essential for the life of the species, their presence is not necessary for some (as a rule, for most) individuals of the species, thus, the population can consist of individuals with 0, 1, 2, 3 (etc.) В chromosomes, but limited to the population by their critical number, i.e., with the maximum known number of Bs in the individuals in the population ([@B15], [@B16]). B chromosomes have been reported in six species of the genus *Apodemus* (*A. peninsulae* Thomas, 1907, *A. agrarius* Pallas, 1771, *A. sylvaticus* Linnaeus, 1758, *A. flavicollis* Melchior, 1834, *A. mystacin

The use of the following dietary supplements has been reported to lead to a significant reduction in blood pressure without severe side-effects in multiple clinical trials ([Table I](#tI-etm-0-0-8375){ref-type="table"}).

3.. Antioxidants and fish oil
=============================

### Coenzyme Q10

CoQ10 is a potent antioxidant and an essential component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain ([@b13-etm-0-0-8375]). A number of studies have indicated that the plasma level of CoQ10 is associated with CVD, including hypertension and CoQ10 supplementation has been shown to be protective against such diseases ([@b14-etm-0-0-8375],[@b15-etm-0-0-8375]). In a 10-week trial with hypertensive patients, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were significantly reduced by 17.8 mmHg and 12.0 mmHg, respectively ([@b16-etm-0-0-8375]). A randomized, double-blind study examining the anti-hypertensive effect of CoQ10 in patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease (CAD) demonstrated that SBP, DBP and heart rate were significantly decreased, and that the plasma levels of antioxidants, such as vitamins A and E were significantly increased after 8 weeks of treatment ([@b17-etm-0-0-8375]). Moreover, patients taking CoQ10 were able to reduce the dosage or the number of anti-hypertensive drugs in several studies ([@b15-etm-0-0-8375],[@b17-etm-0-0-8375]). The postulated principal mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of CoQ10 on hypertension is the decrease in peripheral resistance as a consequence of vasodilatation by preserving nitric oxide (NO) availability ([@b18-etm-0-0-8375]).

Clinical studies have indicated that CoQ10 treatment causes few adverse effects and minimal drug interactions. According to a meta-analysis by Rosenfeldt *et al*, side-effects were observed in only 0.8% in 12 studies with 3,500 patients ([@b19-etm-0-0-8375]). CoQ10 however, may increase the risk of bleeding in patients taking antiplatelet drugs due to its effect on platelet function ([@b20-etm-0-0-8375]). Overall, CoQ10 is a safe dietary supplement and can be a potent adjuvant for anti-

When *Cronobacter sakazakii* BAA-894 Was Grown in M9, Genes Relevant to Exopolysaccharide Biosynthesis Were Significantly Up-Regulated, but Genes Relevant to Flagellum Biosynthesis and Chemotaxis Were Significantly Down-Regulated
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To investigate the response of *C. sakazakii* BAA-894 to amino acid deficiency, total RNAs isolated from BAA-894 grown in LB or M9 media were analyzed. The total number of detected genes from BAA-894 grown in M9 and LB media were 3998 and 3981, respectively. Comparing the BAA-894 cells grown in LB, 2339 genes were up-regulated and 1617 genes were down-regulated in BAA-894 cells grown in M9, and the number of significantly modulated genes was 1263 (785 up-regulated and 478 down-regulated) (**Table [3](#T3){ref-type="table"}** and **Supplementary Table [S1](#SM1){ref-type="supplementary-material"}**).

The conclusion that the block in B cell development seen in IL-7^−/−^ mice after 7 wk of age occurs at the transition between Hardy\'s fractions [1](#R1){ref-type="bib"} A to B, and not B/C to D as originally described [5](#R5){ref-type="bib"}, is supported by several pieces of evidence. The population of B220^+^IgM^−^ cells in the bone marrow of adult IL-7^−/−^ mice does not express the coreceptor molecule CD19, a marker specific for the B cell lineage [17](#R17){ref-type="bib"} [18](#R18){ref-type="bib"}. The same population does not express other markers found on precursor B cells, like BP-1 [19](#R19){ref-type="bib"} and, contrary to the original publication describing the IL-7^−/−^ mice [5](#R5){ref-type="bib"}, we could not detect expression of HSA/CD24. Although some of the B220^+^IgM^−^ cells, which are CD19^−^ in IL-7^−/−^ mice, may represent very early B cell precursors as described [17](#R17){ref-type="bib"} [31](#R31){ref-type="bib"}, we show that the frequency of cells in this population capable of giving rise to B cells in culture is below 1/6,500 in IL-7^−/−^ mice, whereas it is 1/240 for B220^+^IgM^−^ isolated from C57BL/6 mice. It is known that B lymphocytes generated during perinatal life have little diversification at the VDJ junctions [12](#R12){ref-type="bib"} [20](#R20){ref-type="bib"} [21](#R21){ref-type="bib"}, therefore the finding that most B cells present in the spleen of adult IL-7^−/−^ mice have little N-sequence additions suggests that they were produced during the fetal and neonatal period. Both IL-3 [32](#R32){ref-type="bib"} and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) [33](#R33){ref-type="bib"} are candidate factors for supporting B lymphopoiesis in young mice, but it is evident from the data that they play a minor role, if any, during adult bone marrow lymphopoiesis.

A significant proportion of the B220^+^IgM^−^CD19^−^ population expresses the NK 1

Lesion location was defined as damage to each of the four lobes, three layers, and five subcortical structures of the ipsilesional hemisphere. Lesion extent was determined by the ipsilesional hemispheric score, ipsilesional subcortical score, ipsilesional total score and the global score.

Statistical analysis
--------------------

Descriptive statistics were used to document demographic and kinematic characteristics. First, all kinematic parameters were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Differences in UL kinematics between the PWM and CDGM group were investigated using unpaired *t*-tests or Mann-Whitney *U*-tests depending on the type of data. Correlation coefficients were calculated for both lesion timing groups separately, between kinematic parameters and the scores of ipsilesional brain damage, the contralesional total score, the corpus callosum and the global score using spearman (r~s~) or biserial (r~b~) correlation coefficients depending on the type of data. The cerebellum was excluded for further analysis, since none of the participants showed damage to this region. Due to the explorative nature of the study, no correction for multiple testing was applied (Bender and Lange, [@B2]). Hence, correlations will be discussed according to their strength. Correlation coefficients \< 0.30 were considered as little or no correlation, 0.30--0.50 low, 0.50--0.70 moderate, 0.70--0.90 high, and \>0.90 very high (Hinkle et al., [@B13]). Finally, a multiple regression analysis was used to identify the explained variance in UL movement pathology (APS). The variables entered into this model were selected via the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) approach (Tibshirani, [@B40]). Variables entered in the LASSO approach were lesion timing, all ipsilesional scores for lesion location and extent, and age as well all ipsilesional scores with lesion timing as interacting variable. Two-sided 5% level of significance was used. Statistical procedures were carried out with SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

During the preanesthetic examination, a detailed airway examination was done; the length and weight were recorded. The length was measured in centimeter using a measuring tape as well as by BT. The color zone indicated by the BT was recorded. The fifth fingernail width was also noted.

The ETT size was estimated using the following formulae and recorded by one anesthesiologist:

Age based (Penlington formula):\[[@ref6]\]\>6.5 years: Age/3 + 3.5 = ID of ETT in mm\<6.5 years: Age/4 + 4.5 = ID of ETT in mmLength based:\[[@ref7]\]2+ length/30 = ID of ETT in mmLength based: as predicted by Broselow tape (BT)\[[@ref4]\]Fifth fingernail maximum width = ID of ETT in mm.\[[@ref8]\]

In calculating the ETT size, children \<6 months were taken as 0.5 year; those between 6 months and 1 year 6 months were considered 1 year and so on. Since the calculated values may not be multiples of 0.5, they were approximated to the nearest 0.5 or 0.0.

The attending anesthesiologist was blind to the various estimations made regarding ETT size selection. General anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane in an O~2~/N~2~O mixture or propofol as appropriate and maintained with fentanyl and isoflurane in O~2~/N~2~O mixture. Standard monitors were applied including electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, end-tidal CO~2~, and noninvasive blood pressure.

Tracheal intubation was done after muscle relaxation with atracurium 0.5 mg/kg followed by bag-mask ventilation for 3 min. The size of the ETT was selected by the attending anesthesiologist according to the age-based (Penlington) formula, which is the practice in our institute. The correct position of the ETT was confirmed by capnography and auscultation for bilateral breath sounds. The ABF gives the size of the uncuffed ETT to the nearest 0.5 mm. If the ETT chosen was too large for the glottis or resistance was met with at intubation, a 0.5 mm size smaller tube was chosen and this was recorded as a tube change.

The tracheal tube was considered to

PLX4720, AZD8055, GDC0941, BEZ235, Canertinib, Erlotinib (Tarceva), Gefitinib (Iressa), Crenolanib, Lapatinib (Tykerb) and Dasatinib (Sprycel) (all from Selleck Chemicals, Houston, TX, USA) were diluted in DMSO at 10 mM/ml and stored at −20°C until use; when added to cell cultures, the final DMSO concentration was 0.25--0.5%.

Pharmacological growth inhibition assays {#s4_6}
----------------------------------------

Cultured melanoma cells were seeded into 48-well plates. Twenty-four hours after seeding, serial dilutions of individual drugs, drug combinations and/or vehicle (DMSO), as indicated in the text, were added to achieve the desired final concentrations. The doses were 0.004, 0.016, 0.063, 0.25, 1, 4 μM for AZD8055; 0.004, 0.016, 0.063, 0.25, 1, 4, 16 μM for PLX4720 and Dasatinib; 0.063, 0.25, 1, 4, 8, 16 μM for Erlotinib and Gefitinib; 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 μM for GDC0941, Crenolanib and Lapatinib; 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 μM for Canertinib; 0.0016, 0.008, 0.04, 0.02, 1, 5 μM for BEZ235. For growth inhibition, cells were incubated for 72 h and cell viability determined using alamarBlue assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) as previously described \[[@R19]\]. For Western blot, cells were processed after 24 hr incubation.

Growth factor pool stimulation {#s4_7}
------------------------------

After an overnight starvation, melanoma cells were treated for 10 min with serum-free medium containing or not a pool of human growth factors consisting of 100 ng/ml EGF (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), 500 ng/ml recombinant (r) Gas6, 100 ng/ml rNRG1-β1/HRG1-β1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and 100 ng/ml PDGF (Sigma-Aldrich, St.

Total RNA was isolated from cells using an RNA purification kit (Corning Inc., Corning, New York, USA) according to the manufacturer\'s instructions. Reverse transcription was performed using the PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan). qRT-PCR was carried out with SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Perfect Real Time) (Takara Bio) on a LightCycler 96 System (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The primers used in this study are listed in Doc S1. GAPDH was used as an internal control. The results are presented as the expression ratio of target sample to control sample for each group, which was calculated with the cycle threshold method (2^-∆∆CT^).

Cell invasion assay
-------------------

The invasiveness of CTC-3 cells was evaluated with the Matri-gel invasion assay as previously described [@B19] using transwell inserts (8 μm pore size) (BD Biosciences) in a 24 well plate. CTC-3 and MCF-7 cells (10^5^ cells/insert) were seeded on top of the Matri-gel in serum-free minimal essential medium (MEM) and DMEM/F12. The lower chamber was filled with MEM/10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and DMEM/F12/10% FBS. After incubation at 37°C for 48 h, CTC-3 and MCF-7 cells that had migrated through the membrane were stained with crystal violet and counted under a microscope.

Statistical analysis
--------------------

Data are expressed as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using Prism v.7.0 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA), Origin 8 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA, USA), and Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) software. Results are expressed as mean ± SD of at least three independent experiments. The significance of differences among groups was assessed with the two-tailed Student\'s t test for normally distributed data, and P \< 0.05 and \< 0.01 were considered significant and highly significant, respectively.

CPS and OPS are the most abundant and immunogenic molecules on the surface of *B. pseudomallei* and *B. mallei* and play critical roles in pathogenesis, as mutants lacking the polysaccharides are severely impaired in virulence \[[@B61],[@B69]-[@B71]\]. Both structures are highly conserved throughout these *Burkholderia* species \[[@B61],[@B69],[@B72]-[@B78]\] and have been shown to elicit the production of antibodies in human cases of melioidosis and glanders \[[@B79]-[@B82]\].

The anatomic variations of the first dorsal extensor compartment may have an effect on the underlying pathophysiology of de Quervain\'s tenosynovitis and be associated with a relatively poorer response to nonsurgical treatment.^\[[@R1],[@R4]\]^ Bahm et al^\[[@R4]\]^ reported a division of the first dorsal compartment by an additional septum in 60% of patients with symptomatic de Quervain\'s disease. The APL tendon consisted of multiple tendons in 76% of the patients. The EPB tendon included a single tendon in 96% of the patients. Gao et al^\[[@R9]\]^ reported an incidence of 67.5% for general septum in 40 cadavers, and the mean length of the septum was 5 mm. Therefore, during surgery, the sheath covering the first dorsal compartment as well as a separate subcompartment for the 2 tendons should be released. It was reported that exploring 5 mm proximal from the radial styloid process was especially useful for identifying the septum and the subcompartment.^\[[@R9]\]^ Missing this step is the most common cause of dissatisfaction after the release of first dorsal compartment for de Quervain\'s tenosynovitis.^\[[@R10]\]^ We also evaluated other subcompartments after releasing the retinaculum of the first dorsal compartment. However, initially due to detection challenges, we dissected more distally to the radiocarpal joint. We found another slip of tendon in the ulnar side of APL tendon. Surprisingly, it was EPL tendon. Although some studies have reported to have found an accessory EPL tendon during anatomical dissection, the EPL tendon is known to be a consistent structure, unlike the anomalies and variations of other extensor tendons of the hand.^\[[@R6],[@R11],[@R12]\]^

Anomalous course of EPL tendon with similar symptoms of de Quervain\'s disease is extremely rare. To date only 5 cases of anomalous course of EPL tendon in symptomatic patients have been reported in the English literature.^\[[@R6]--[@R8],[@R12]\]^ Nishijo et al^\[[@R6]\]^ described duplicated EPL passing radial to Lister\'s tubercle into the first dorsal compartment and in her left hand, ulnar to Lister\'s tubercle in a normal course. Sawaizumi et al^\[[@R12]\]^ also described the anomalous course of duplicated EPL tendon, one of them in a new compartment. Abe et al^\[[@R7]\]^

Follistatin and SB431542 but not anti-TGF-β antibody also inhibited upregulation of Oct4A and Nanog, providing experimental evidence pluripotency is mediated by endogenous activin/Smad2 signaling. Since only expression of ALK4 (which preferably binds to activin A), but not ALK7 (which preferably binds to activin AB and B), was strongly induced during culture, activin A may be the relevant activin isoform in PCMO cultures, although PCMO are responsive to all three activin isoforms (see [Fig. 4](#pone.0118097.g004){ref-type="fig"}).

TGF-β1 levels in the cultures negatively correlated with Oct4A and Nanog expression (TGF-β1 declined from day 2 to day 4, while Oct4A/Nanog rose and peaked at days 4--5 \[[@pone.0118097.ref004]\] and antibody-mediated neutralization of TGF-βs in the cultures, in contrast to follistatin, slightly increased both Oct4A and Nanog expression (see [Fig. 5B](#pone.0118097.g005){ref-type="fig"}). This suggests that TGF-β signaling is inhibiting rather than promoting pluripotency. Along the same lines are findings that TGF-β signaling antagonized reprogramming efficiency during generation of iPS cells from fully differentiated somatic cells, since blockage of TGF-β signaling by antibody-mediated depletion of ligands or SB431542-mediated inhibition of ALK4/5/7, significantly increased the reprogramming efficiency \[[@pone.0118097.ref019], [@pone.0118097.ref020]\]. This is noteworthy, since as outlined above, PCMO generation appears to resemble the process of reprogramming of somatic cells to iPS cells. Interestingly, p21^WAF1^ not only arrests monocytes in G1/S in response to TGF-β, but also has a role in differentiation of human peripheral blood monocyte precursors to macrophages and functional dendritic cells \[[@pone.0118097.ref033]\], and to osteoclasts \[[@pone.0118097.ref034], [@pone.0118097.ref035]\]. Hence, its downregulation is not only compatible with relief from growth inhibition but may also confer enhanced pluripotency. Another issue related to this is as to whether the decline in autocrine TGF-β levels, either on its own or because it allows for enhanced activin signaling,

To better understand why p-Ulk1 remained unchanged by treatment with nonionic osmolytes, we used the mTOR inhibitor torin 1, which was expected to block the pathways of both mTORC1 and mTORC2. As expected, torin 1 apparently suppressed the phosphorylation of Ulk1, Akt, S6K1, and 4E-BP1 under normal conditions, and similar reductions were also observed under amino acid deprivation, except that the decrease of p-Akt was not so remarkable ([Fig. 6](#F6){ref-type="fig"}). Under conditions of sucrose stress, torin 1 partially suppressed the phosphorylation of all the proteins, albeit to different extents ([Fig. 6](#F6){ref-type="fig"}). Moreover, the phosphorylation of Akt, a substrate of mTORC2, was remarkably reduced under sucrose stress ([Fig. 6](#F6){ref-type="fig"}), indicating that mTORC2 is suppressed under hyperosmotic stress. These results suggest that the high phosphorylation states of Ulk1, as observed under hyperosmotic

The stored form of glucose is glycogen, which exists mostly in liver and muscle tissue. Liver and muscle tissues were excised after the mice were sacrificed and weighed for glycogen content analysis as we described previously \[[@r20]\]. The weights of the related visceral organs were recorded.

Histology of tissues
--------------------

All tissues were carefully removed, minced and fixed in 10% formalin. Samples were embedded in paraffin and cut into 4-*µ*m thick slices for morphological and pathological evaluations. Tissue was stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and examined under an optical microscope equipped with a CCD camera (BX-51, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) by a veterinary pathologist.

Statistical analysis
--------------------

All data are expressed as mean ± SEM, n=8 mice/group. Statistical differences among groups were analyzed by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Cochran-Armitage test for dose-effect trend analysis with SAS 9.0 (SAS Inst., Cary, NC, U.S.A.). *P*\<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Differences between groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Duncan's *post-hoc* test, and *P* values \<0.05 were considered significant.

Charantin content of WBG extract
--------------------------------

We measured the charantin content in Hualian No. 4 Wild Bitter Gourd extract (WBG) by HPLC analysis. The retention time of charantin was approximately 13 min, and the content of charantin in WBG extract was 0.45 mg/g.

Effects of WBG on forelimb grip strength

After supplementation with WBG for 4 weeks, the forelimb grip strengths in the vehicle, WBG-1X and WBG-2.5X groups were 129 ± 4, 144 ± 3 and 146 ± 4 g, respectively ([Fig. 1](#fig_001){ref-type="fig"}Fig. 1.Effect of WBG (Hualian No. 4 Wild Bitter Gourd) supplementation for 4 weeks on forelimb grip strength.

Physical Activity Outcomes
--------------------------

The PA outcomes reported can be divided into 5 categories: days per week meeting activity guidelines, cardiorespiratory fitness, MVPA, general activity, muscular strength, and competency. Within each of these categories, individual measures can be isolated by the amount of time they capture and whether they are subjective or objective measures. Parsed out, there are 18 total PA outcomes measured among the 16 studies included (see [Table 1](#table1){ref-type="table"}, column titled *Physical Activity Outcomes*). A total of 8 measures appear in more than 1 study, the most common being objective daily MVPA (5/13) \[[@ref25],[@ref30]-[@ref32],[@ref36]\] followed by subjective weekly PA (5/16) \[[@ref31],[@ref33],[@ref35],[@ref37],[@ref38]\]. Of the 18 PA outcome measures, 44% were subjective, self-reported measures. Significant improvement in a PA outcome over time in the group with the mHealth intervention was observed for all but 2 of the eligible included studies (ineligible: Direito et al and Mendoza et al, which did not present results for this type of analysis); however, this improvement was not always unique to the intervention group. Of the 13 studies that contained a control or comparison group, only 5 \[[@ref22],[@ref24],[@ref31],[@ref32],[@ref33]\] showed an improvement in a PA outcome that was significantly different from the results of the control or comparison group. Within the 5 studies that showed significant results for between-groups analyses, 3 studies \[[@ref22],[@ref24],[@ref32]\] isolated the mHealth component in the intervention. In addition, 2 of the 3 studies utilized a website and wearable intervention \[[@ref24],[@ref32]\] and 1 utilized an app and a wearable \[[@ref23]\]. The PA outcomes that improved in the 3 studies were objective daily MVPA \[[@ref25]\], subjective weekly PA \[[@ref33]\], and number of days per week of 60 min of PA \[[@ref23]\], respectively.

From another angle, to illustrate the benefits of our proposed approach. It is suggested to use one way analysis of variance ANOVA to compare statistical significance of the different values of each parameter on the results of the vessel segmentation.

Experimental Evaluation
=======================

This section briefly explains the details about the datasets used for conducting these experiments and showing the performance measures used on each of these datasets.

Materials
---------

The optimization experiments are performed on three publicly available datasets (DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE-DB1) to find the optimal parameters.

### DRIVE dataset

DRIVE dataset ([@ref-33]) is a standardized set of fundus images used for benchmarking the effectiveness of vessel segmentation and classification. These images were captured in Netherlands for the purpose of screening the diabetic retinopathy. A total of 400 diabetic subjects data is collected between the age group of 25--90 years. All images are compressed with JPEG. Canon CR5 3CCD non-mydriatic camera was used for capturing these images. The resolution of each image is 768 by 584 pixels having 8 bits per pixel. A set of 20 images in each training and test datasets. The dataset includes manually prepared ground truth images and masks that are made by two experts.

### STARE dataset

STARE ([@ref-23]) dataset was used for blood vessel segmentation. It is composed of 20 retinal images 10 of them have pathologies. The image capturing is achieved using a TopCon TRV-50 fundus camera. Each image has a resolution of 605 by 700 pixels with 8-bit RGB channels. Two sets of manually segmented images are prepared by two different observers.

### CHASE-DB1 dataset

CHASE-DB1 ([@ref-19]) dataset is collected in England

In this paper we present five cases of HCA in whom granulomas in the tumor and/or surrounding liver parenchyma were found, and in 1 case even diffuse granulomatous hepatitis (GH). Three papers in the English literature and one in the French literature have reported the coexistence of HCA and liver granulomas in the past 30 years \[[@B5], [@B6], [@B7]\]. Patient characteristics are summarized in **table [1](#T1){ref-type="table"}** (upper part). Case 3 has been previously published \[[@B5]\]. An overview of previously published cases is shown in the lower part of table [1](#T1){ref-type="table"}.

Case 1 {#sec1_2}
======

A 36-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and 15 years of oral contraceptive (OC) use was referred to the surgical department. She presented with acute upper abdominal pain caused by bleeding of a hepatic lesion (12.5 cm) during the 19th week of pregnancy, which was treated by selective arterial embolization of the branches of the feeding hepatic arteries in segment 2 and 3 (**fig. [1a](#F1){ref-type="fig"}**). One year later, the patient presented with abdominal pain similar to the pain during the previous episode of bleeding, and imaging showed signs of recurrent bleeding (fig. [1b](#F1){ref-type="fig"}). At laparotomy the liver surface appeared macroscopically inhomogeneous with disseminated pale lesions of approximately 0.5--1.0 cm with a tendency to confluence (fig. [1c, d](#F1){ref-type="fig"}). A diffusely metastasized malignancy was suspected, however intraoperative frozen sections of these lesions revealed granulomas. Histopathological examination showed multiple HCAs: hepatocellular proliferation without cytonuclear atypia, but with the presence of thick-walled vessels, areas of necrosis, hemorrhage, and in some vessels embolization material (fig. [1e](#F1){ref-type="fig"}). These HCAs remained unclassified as liver fatty acid binding protein (LFABP), glutamine synthetase (GS), C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) did not show any aberrant expression patterns \[[@B8]\]. Throughout the HCA lesions and liver, tissue was disrupted by epithelioid granulomas with a necrotic center containing multinucleated giant cells (fig. [1f](#F

The outcomes of Pro12Ala (*PPARG*) in non-Asian population: Pooling of data from eligible compared groups indicated that the group with the 'PP' genotype had higher levels of TG (MD: 0.06, 95% CI: 0.01--0.11, *P* = 0.02; *I*^*2*^ = 67%) than the combined 'PA+AA' genotype group. No statistically significant differences in the levels of TC (MD: 0.02, 95% CI: −0.03 to 0.06, *P* = 0.46; *I*^*2*^ = 29%), LDL-C (MD: 0.02, 95% CI: −0.02 to 0.06, *P* = 0.39; *I*^*2*^ = 22%) and HDL-C (MD: −0.01, 95% CI: −0.02 to 0.00, *P* = 0.06; *I*^*2*^ = 43%) were detected between the 'PP' and 'PA+AA' groups (Figs [4](#fig04){ref-type="fig"}--[6](#fig06){ref-type="fig"}, [Fig S3](#SD1){ref-type="supplementary-material"}).

Higher educational level and higher total mindfulness scores were reported to improve patients' perception of QoL \[[@CR13], [@CR23], [@CR28]\]. Alkan et al. reported that approximately 70% of the study participants had low-middle education, resulting in poor QoL in this group \[[@CR38]\]. Another study reported lower Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) scores for KOA females with chronic physical or mental health conditions \[[@CR62]\]. Poverty also worsened QoL in KOA patients \[[@CR45]\]. Psychological distress and depression worsened QoL \[[@CR23], [@CR28], [@CR42], [@CR54]\]. Patients lacking familial relationships reported worse QoL \[[@CR50]\].

QoL and surgical interventions {#Sec15}
------------------------------

The majority of QoL findings with surgical intervention were reported as dependents of demographic variables, which showed an effect on QoL after surgical outcomes. Williams et al. \[[@CR47]\], for example, reported that patient satisfaction was lower among patients younger than 55 years of age compared to older patients. Vulcano, reported a higher BMI was associated with worse outcomes \[[@CR46]\]. Perez-Prieto, reported patients with depression had less improvement that non-depressed patients after surgical intervention, reporting lower QoL scores \[[@CR42]\]. Lower socioeconomic groups undergoing surgical intervention also reported worse QoL \[[@CR45]\]. Patients participating in sports pre- and post- surgical intervention reported higher QoL scores \[[@CR40]\].

Discussion {#Sec16}
==========

This systematic review aimed to broaden the amount of QoL data available for summarizing, using less stringent search criteria; for example, inclusion of articles irrespective of QoL being the primary endpoint. This review included surgical and non-surgical data including QoL measurement.

The broad search strategy identified 62 articles as reporting information on QoL associated to one other factor (demographic, lifestyle, or comorbidity) between KOA patients and control patients. Article details are presented in Table [1](#Tab1){ref-type="table"}. The quality appraisal tool revealed all studies as moderate to high quality yet caution should be taken in the interpretation of findings, as this tool may not discern scientific & analytic rigour assessing QoL but scores prioritizing criteria description. For example, describing sample size, potential biases, etc. would be sufficient to permit a high score even with low analytic rigour.

It is well known that patient characteristics influence QoL. In this

All participants provided informed consent. The Human Ethics Review Committee of Ibaraki Prefectural University of Health Sciences approved this study (approval No. 485).

We used the Japanese version of the short form of the Profile of Mood States (POMS-SF)[@r14]^)^ to assess psychological mood. The POMS-SF contains 30 items and evaluates 6 mood states (tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue, and confusion) during the past week. Each mood score was converted to T score based on data from Japanese females aged 30--39 years in the general population[@r14]^)^. A high score on any variable except vigor indicates an undesirable mood state.

We assessed sleep states with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)[@r15]^)^. Although the original version of the PSQI assesses sleep states during the past month, to match the recall period used with the POMS-SF, we asked about sleep during the past week. The PSQI comprises 19 self-rated questions and calculates 7 sleep components: latency, subjective quality, duration, efficiency (sleep duration per total time in bed), disturbance, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction. A higher PSQI score indicates poorer sleep states, and a person with a score above 5.5 points is regarded as having insomnia[@r16]^)^.

A previous study reported the PSQI scores of the general Japanese population[@r17]^)^; these data were used to examine differences in sleep states between Japanese females in the general population and female wheelchair basketball players. To compare sleep states in the two populations, we used the Student's t-test via manual analysis with Excel 2013 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA). To examine the relationship between sleep and mood states in our small sample, we used Spearman's rank correlation. Analysis was performed with IBM SPSS Statistics package, Version 24.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The level of significance was set at p\<0.05.

The following variables were studied: (1) the organization of the attack: whether it was organized or unorganized, and in the case of an organized attack whether it was done through verbal, non-verbal, or both verbal and non-verbal communication; (2) the numerical relation attack defense taking into account the equality, the superiority and the inferiority with or without the goalkeeper; (3) the tactical means used in the pre-finalization, whether it was coordinated or carried out by the center back: the position changes, the curtain, the second pivot entrance, the cross and block with or without the ball, or the absence of tactical means; (4) the finalization zone of the offensive sequence -- a field map was designed with 12 zones: 11 zones on the offensive side (left/right wing, left/central/right zones from 6 to 9 m; left/central/right zones from 9 to 15 m; left/central/right zones from 15 to 20 m) and 1 zone on the defensive side; (5) the mode of finalization due to the participation of the center back in the offensive sequence taking into account the assistance, shots, shots after feint, dribble and break passes, ball losses, and no relevant action---this means that the center back is playing without influencing the offensive sequence, which is considered after the center back has passed the ball but in the next fourth pass no finalization of the sequence occurred; (6) the result of the finalization is no shots, goals, no goals, 7 m penalty with goals, or no goals; and (7) the partial score can be based on a draw, a balanced victory, an unbalanced victory (by 4 or more goals), a balanced defeat, and an unbalanced defeat (by 4 or more goals).

Quality of Data {#sec6}
---------------

Data were observed and recorded using Lince 1.2.1 software analyzed with GSEQ 5.23, HOSAN 1.6.3.3.5, and SAGT 1.0 software.

Observational methodology entails collection of quality data for research. To guarantee reliable results, data were collected using the Cohen's *κ* and the *G* tests. While in the former, intra- and inter-observer were used; in the latter, the C/O and O/C models were applied.

Observer reliability was tested after the training period (between 0.83 and 0.96

Due to their remarkable capabilities, MSCs have tremendous potential in many modern therapeutic areas such as regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, and in novel immunosuppressant therapies. Thus, MSCs are the subject of numerous studies. In the majority of these studies, the classical bone marrow derived MSCs (BMMSCs) have been used. However, MSCs are relatively rare in human bone marrow. Their numbers and differentiation capacity decline with age. In addition, bone marrow aspiration is an invasive procedure ([@B18]). Regarding these limitations, conversely the promising results from clinical trials and consequently large numbers of MSCs required for future cellbased therapies, necessitates finding alternative sources for MSCs.

In recent years, stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) have emerged as a new population of MSCs ([@B19]) which can be a preferable source for their ever-increasing applications. exfoliated deciduous teeth are readily accessible and free from ethical concerns as the teeth are discarded. An advantage is the lack of pain and trauma to the patient when they are harvested. Obtaining stem cells from exfoliated deciduous teeth requires a simple, convenient method ([@B20], [@B21]).

Approximately 15 years ago Miura et al. ([@B22]) isolated SHED. Therefore, there is limited data; particularly the published studies on the immune properties of SHED are few ([@B23]). We have previously shown that SHED are comparable to conventional MSCs or BMMSCs. They suppress the proliferation and cytokine production of *in vitro* activated T cells ([@B24]). In the current study, we have examined the probable role of the IFN-γ-IDO axis in immunosuppression of SHED compared to BMMSCs.

Materials and Methods
=====================

Approximately 10^5^ T cells stimulated by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) in the lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) or allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in MLC were placed adjacent to various numbers of SHED or BMMSCs, as separate co-cultures. MSCs were inactivated by mitomycin in order to prevent expansion and consequently delete any further interference with lymphocyte proliferation. Previous studies demonstrated that the dose of MSCs might affect their immunoregulation, therefore we used a different number of MSCs.

The Ethics Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences approved this analytical-descriptive, cross-sectional study.

These results indicate that *C. albicans* is able to acquire sufficient inositol to support an infection whether it synthesizes inositol *de novo* or imports it from the host. The serum of rats and humans contains 20--100 μM and 61±12.4 μM inositol, respectively ([@r38]; [@r42]; [@r63]). Mouse serum is most likely similar, as the *Caino1*Δ*/Caino1*Δ mutant can clearly proliferate in the mouse ([@r12]).

In order to determine if CaIno1p and CaItr1p provide the only two routes for acquiring inositol from the host, a conditional double mutant between *Caino1*Δ and *Caitr1*Δ was constructed. In *C. albicans* the *MET3* promoter (*P~MET3~*) can be used as a conditional promoter because *P~MET3~* is strongly activated in the absence of sulfur-containing amino acids such as cysteine and methionine (Cys/Met), but in the presence of Cys/Met in the medium *P~MET3~* is transcriptionally repressed ([@r9]). A conditional double mutant was constructed by disrupting both copies of *CaINO1* (*Caino1*Δ*/Caino1*Δ) and one copy of *CaITR1* (*Caitr1*Δ). The promoter of the remaining wild-type copy of *CaITR1* was replaced on the chromosome with the *P~MET3~* promoter. The resulting strain grew at a wild-type rate in the absence of Cys/Met in the medium, but did not grow at all in the presence of Cys/Met. These data indicated that *C. albicans* has no way to obtain inositol *in vitro* aside from *de novo* synthesis through CaIno1p or import via CaItr1p. This appears to be true for *C. albicans* in the host as well, since in a mouse model for systemic infection, the conditional double mutant was avirulent and the mice showed no symptoms of infection, which is consistent with the hypothesis that the strains could not survive due to a lack of inositol. The mouse bloodstream contains sufficient Cys/Met to shut off the *P~MET3~* promoter ([@r12]; [@r68]). Even a strain that contained homozygous mutations for *CaINO1*

The role of ^18^F-FDG PET/CT in initial staging of gastric carcinoma is well studied. It is also well known that findings on ^18^F-FDG PET/CT scan needs to be interpreted correlating with the clinical history and findings of adjunct investigations. We describe a rare case of gastric carcinoma with concomitant silicosis resulting in unusual lung findings in ^18^F-FDG PET/CT scan.

CASE REPORT {#sec1-2}
===========

A 48-year-old man presented with persistent dyspnea and melena. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a mass lesion in the antrum of stomach, which on biopsy proved to be a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. The patient was a nonsmoker, however, an occupational history of exposure to silica dust was present. Past history of pulmonary tuberculosis 20 years back which was treated with a complete course of anti-tubercular medications could be noted. Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (^18^F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scan was done for initial staging of gastric carcinoma. ^18^F-FDG PET/CT scan revealed intense FDG uptake in the mass lesion in the antrum of the stomach \[[Figure 1a](#F1){ref-type="fig"}--[c](#F1){ref-type="fig"}\]. No abnormal FDG avid abdominal lymph nodes were noted however a few FDG nonavid regional lymph nodes were noted. Intensely FDG avid thick walled cavitary lesion in the right lung upper lobe \[[Figure 1d](#F1){ref-type="fig"}\] with multiple intensely FDG avid parenchymal and pleural-based nodules were noted in both the lung fields \[[Figure 1f](#F1){ref-type="fig"}\], largest measuring 2.8 cm × 2.7 cm in the left lower lobe. FDG avid right supraclavicular \[[Figure 1g](#F1){ref-type="fig"}\] and multiple mediastinal lymph nodes were also noted \[[Figure 1e](#F1){ref-type="fig"}\]. The possibility of a second primary in the lung with lymph nodal and lung metastases was also considered as carcinoma stomach with such extensive lung metastases in the absence of regional lymph node involvement is very unusual. Bronchoscopy-guided biopsy of the mediastinal lesions was done which revealed

4. Discussion {#sec4-pharmacy-04-00031}
=============

The use of a standardized resident examination was first used within our institution and results are described in detail elsewhere \[[@B2-pharmacy-04-00031]\]. We previously described the utility of this examination to quantify changes in resident knowledge throughout the year as well as provide insight into potential targeted areas for improvement in the residency program. Likewise, the results of this examination are useful for detecting potential knowledge deficits of the resident and developing a customized PGY1 learning plan. Identified early in the year, this may help reduce unnecessary stress for both the resident and program director. It has been reported that 6%--15% of pharmacy students have some form of academic deficiency during their training \[[@B3-pharmacy-04-00031]\]. Currently there is not published data on the percentage of pharmacy residents reporting difficulty or needing intervention during their PGY1 year. However, our medical colleagues have noted that approximately 8%--15% of residents struggle during their residency \[[@B3-pharmacy-04-00031]\]. Additionally, unlike pharmacy school, most pharmacy residency programs do not have structured assistance programs designed to help the resident \[[@B4-pharmacy-04-00031]\].

Given that our exam was addressing core disciplines, we were able to hone in on particular areas that may need further development for a resident. For example, a resident who did well in internal medicine but struggled with critical care may benefit from having a critical care experience earlier in the year or an additional rotation in that area to help increase their knowledge base. Alternatively, utilizing the areas of strength may help a resident with the selection of a PGY2 specialty residency. This too would be beneficial early in the year to allow for more experience with that specialty prior to the annual recruitment process for PGY2 programs.

There are several limitations to our study. First, a larger proportion of questions focused on the medicine and critical care core disciplines which parallel the resident experiences in our PGY1 residency program. Accordingly, exam performance in other core disciplines may not accurately reflect each resident's knowledge in that area. We did not account for testing bias, including the possibility of score inflation from repeated exposure to exam questions. Studies of higher-stakes examinations in medical training, however, have shown that prior exposure does not significantly improve performance \[[@B5-pharmacy-04-00031],[@B6-pharmacy-04-00031]\]. Finally, we did not assess if this type of exam

An alternative system based on the RNA-binding protein Pumilio and split-GFP (green fluorescent protein) was established for RNA detection in vitro and in cells.[@b18]--[@b21] Since Pumilio binds to RNA sequences specifically, the RNA of interest does not have to be extended by a tag, which is a major advantage. The bipartite or tripartite split-GFP becomes fluorescent only upon correctly positioned binding of the Pumilio proteins.[@b18],[@b20],[@b22],[@b23]

Beyond methods based on hybridization or binding, covalent modification of biomolecules, including RNA, has received considerable attention. Recent developments in the field of bioorthogonal chemistry have yielded a toolbox of reactions for labeling biomolecules even in complex environments.[@b2],[@b24]--[@b27] The premise for these strategies is to equip the biomolecule of choice with an appropriate bioorthogonal group. In the field of RNA, enzymatic modification---particularly using RNA methyltransferases and cosubstrate analogs---has been very successful to selectively furnish RNA with a bioorthogonal group. In a second (chemical and ideally bioorthogonal) reaction, a reporter molecule becomes covalently linked to the modified target RNA. Although bioorthogonal reactions have been successfully used to convert modified RNA in cells, chemo-enzymatic approaches have so far only been used in vitro or in fixed cells to label DNA or RNA.[@b24],[@b25],[@b28]--[@b34]

In the frequently used copper(I)-catalyzed azide--alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), a Cu^I^-activated terminal alkyne reacts with an azide to form a triazol.[@b35],[@b36] Although CuAAC has been used successfully to label RNA in vitro as well as in fixed cells,[@b24],[@b25],[@b29],[@b37] its application inside living cells seems to be limited due to the toxicity of copper(I).[@b38] Problems arising from copper are circumvented in the strain-promoted azide--alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) of cyclooctynes with azides, which form triazoles without requiring a catalyst.[@b27],[@b37] However, application of SPAAC can be compromised in living cells due to cross reactivity of cyclooctyne derivatives and cellular thiols.[@b39] Although azides and alkynes are currently the most widely used bioorthogonal groups, alternatives have been explored, and

Ethiopia is one of the countries with high maternal mortality rate; the estimated rate in 2005 was 673 per 100,000 live births \[[@B9]\]. In one of the surveys conducted in Ethiopia, among 1075 women who presented with abortion, about 58% were between age group of 20-29; and non use of contraceptive contributed to 78% of these pregnancies and rape accounted for 3% of the abortions \[[@B10]\]. In a study conducted in one of the high schools of Ethiopia, the prevalence of attempted rape was 8.8% and the prevalence of performed rape was 11.5% \[[@B11]\].

Despite the fact that different modern contraceptives exist world wide, the problem of unintended pregnancy still exists, which could be due to gap in awareness, negative attitudes towards contraception, low accessibility or as a result of sexual assault. At times, the knowledge and practice might be there but no contraceptive is 100% effective, and it is always very vital to have EC as a backup method. In one of the studies conducted among 417 women of post abortal care clients in Ethiopia, 59(14.1%) had ever heard of EC, and only 15(8.6%) had ever used EC \[[@B12]\]. In another study among 833 college students in one of the towns of Ethiopia, the magnitude of sexual violence was 47.9%, and unwanted pregnancy was found to be 16.9%; about 228(27.4%) had knowledge about EC, 20(2.4%) had ever used it and about 548(65.8%) had favorable attitude towards use of EC \[[@B13]\].

Considering the importance of EC in preventing unintended pregnancy, this study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice of EC and to further elucidate the relationship between these factors and socioeconomic and demographic characteristics among female undergraduate students of AAU.

Study area

The study was conducted in AAU, the biggest University of Ethiopia, which is located in the capital city of the country, Addis Ababa. Ethiopia is one of the low income countries in sub Saharan Africa, with high fertility rate, which is about 5.4 \[[@B14]\]. In Ethiopia, there are different ethnic groups with different cultures, for example, Amhara, Oromo, and Tigre etc. Christianity and Islam are the major religions in the country \[[@B14]\].

Neutralizing effects of donor serum
-----------------------------------

We initially considered the dilution effects of the recipient sera with RPMI ([Fig. 4](#F4){ref-type="fig"}). The majority of the MFI ratios of the diluted sera in the inhibition FCXM were lower than those of the neat sera in the conventional FCXM. Generally, MFI values linearly reflected the DSA levels in recipient sera. When the MFI ratios of neat sera were more than 10 or less than 2, the dilution effects were not apparent. This may be because the relationship between the MFI ratio and the corresponding DSA level is not linear within these ranges.

To avoid confusion caused by dilution effects, the mixed sera (recipient+donor) were compared only to the diluted sera (with RPMI or third-party serum). The inhibition FCXM experiments for verifying the neutralizing effects of a previous sensitizer's serum are summarized in [Fig. 5](#F5){ref-type="fig"} and [Table 3](#T3){ref-type="table"}.

1\. Negative FCXM with non-sensitizers or previous sensitizers as donors: The sera of non-sensitizers (N=6) did not show any neutralizing effects. In negative FCXM, even with previous sensitizers as donors (N=69), matrix effects of RPMI were apparent in both T cell and B cell FCXM.

2\. Matrix effects in any positive FCXM (T cell or B cell) with previous sensitizers as donors (N=74): Matrix effects of RPMI were evident in the B cell FCXM with class I DSAs alone (N=14), and in the T cell FCXM with any positive DSA (class I or class II, N=74). Matrix effects of third-party sera were shown in the T cell FCXM with class II DSAs alone (N=27), in the T cell FCXM with any positive DSA (class I or class II, N=74), and in the B cell FCXM for total previous sensitizers (N=143).

3\. Neutralizing effects in any positive FCXM (T cell or B cell) with previous sensitizers as donors (N=74): In the group with class I DSAs alone (N=14), neutralizing effects were evident in the T cell FCXM compared to the sera diluted with RPMI. In the group with class II DSAs alone (N=27), no neutralizing effects were seen in the B

We wondered whether the KYP and DRM1/2 targets also showed a transposon-like distribution. This would be expected if KYP and DRM1/2 targets mostly comprise a representative sample of CMT3 targets. Indeed, the KYP target distribution along the chromosome nearly superimposes over that for CMT3 (Figure [3b](#F3){ref-type="fig"}), which together with the nearly complete inclusion of KYP targets within the set of CMT3 targets, indicates that KYP and CMT3 have the same target preferences. In contrast, DRM1/2 targets are scattered throughout the chromosome arms, with only one of ten targets in the most proximal 2 Mb where about half of the CMT3 targets are found; this difference in the distribution of elements is statistically significant (*p* = 0.013, Fisher\'s exact test). We conclude that CMT3 and KYP target transposable elements in general, whereas DRM1/2 is required primarily at elements that are distally located along the chromosome.

Our conclusion that DRM1/2 targets are distinct from CMT3 targets is unlikely to have resulted from false positives in the DRM1/2 dataset. As previously mentioned, DRM1/2 targets are enriched in transposons. In addition, the close correspondence between CMT3 and KYP distributions, even considering just the 85% of CMT3 targets that are not KYP targets (Figure [3c](#F3){ref-type="fig"}), implies that the cutoff criteria used for target detection were very conservative. As indicated below, it appears that the large majority of KYP targets were simply too weak relative to CMT3 targets to be detected in the context of a whole-genome analysis. Furthermore, the CMT3 DRM1/2 dataset provides an independent test of the stringency of our cutoff criteria, because we would expect it to include all of the CMT3 targets; but it actually is a smaller set that only partially overlaps. This partial overlap is evidently not attributable to false positives in both datasets, because the distributions of CMT3 and CMT3 DRM1/2 targets essentially superimpose (Figure [3c](#F3){ref-type="fig"}), even considering just the 21% of CMT3 targets that are not CMT3 DRM1/2 targets. This indicates that the small number of DRM1/2 targets results from strict cutoff criteria that identify a subset of truly affected loci.

Subjects {#sec2.1}
--------

Nineteen state-level weightlifters (16 males, 3 females) aged 14.74 ± 1.4 years (range, 13--17 years), with height of 1.58 ± 0.09 m (range, 1.42--1.72 m) and body weight of 62.82 ± 16.24 kg (range, 45.9--96.6 kg) voluntarily participated in our study. Subjects were recruited from a group of state-level adolescent weightlifters with at least 2 years of experience in competitive weightlifting. Those who had undergone rehabilitative programs for any shoulder injury in the prior 2 years were excluded from the study. The study was approved by the human research ethics committee of a local university. The study protocol was in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, 1975. All participants and their legal guardians were informed of the experimental procedures. Upon agreement, signed consent forms were obtained.

Testing procedure {#sec2.2}
-----------------

Muscular strength was measured according to a standard protocol using an isokinetic dynamometer (Multi-Joint System 3 Pro; Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY, USA). Strict adherence to the guidelines of the Biodex isokinetic dynamometer operation manual was followed for positioning of the subject, calibration, correction for gravity, familiarisation, and strong verbal encouragement. Subjects were familiarised with the use of the dynamometer and testing procedure prior to measurement. The testing session began with a 10-min warm up and stretching emphasising the shoulder area.

The seated position with 45° shoulder abduction in the scapular plane was used to evaluate the concentric variables of peak torque/body weight, time to peak torque, and average power both in external and internal rotation. With the subject seated, the chair was rotated 15° towards the side opposite the tested shoulder. The dynamometer was rotated 20° backwards relative to the frontal position of the chair. The dominant side was determined by asking the subject. Next, the dynamometer was tilted 50° upward from 0° in neutral position. The shoulder and elbow were attached to the dynamometer and the shaft dot was aligned right or left, depending on the shoulder of interest, and secured with a locking knob. The subject was then moved into position. The dynamometer was raised to align with the axis of rotation of

Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) assay
---------------------------------

Nitric oxide synthase activity was measured utilizing the protocol previously described \[[@B31]\]: total intestinal cells of the larvae (L3) of *A. aegypti* were recovered with trypsin/EDTA (0.05/0.02% v/v; Sigma Chemical Co.), washed and resuspended in 2 mL of HEPES buffer (pH 7.2; Sigma Chemical Co.). Protein concentration was 10.7 mg/mL as measured by spectrometry (260-280 nm). Next, the sample was mixed with a protease inhibitor cocktail, consisting of 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.01% leupeptin, 0.2 mg/mL trypsin inhibitor and 1.0 mM benzamidine), in a final volume of 5 mL \[[@B31]\]. Aliquots of lysed cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen for later assay of NOS activity.

NOS activity
------------

In each assay, intestinal homogenate containing 200 μg/mL protein was mixed with the following reagents (all from Sigma Chemical Co.) in a 400-μL final volume: 0.2 mM NADPH, 360 μM L-arginine, 2 μM tetrahydrobiopterin, 1.0 μM FAD, 1.0 μM FMN, 0.3 mM CaCl~2~, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol and 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). In some samples, the constitutive NOS inhibitor L^ω^-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (Sigma Chemical Co.), inducible NOS inhibitor diphenyliodonium chloride (Sigma Chemical Co.) and burchellin (1) (20 μg/mL) were added. A solution of acetone was used as a negative control and L-NAME as a positive control. NOS activity was determined in the reaction mixture by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm for 20 min continuously, and expressed as the amount of NADPH consumed during the enzymatic conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline. Three independent experiments were performed, and the data obtained using different treatments were analyzed statistically by means of the Mann-Whitney test (P \< 0.05).

To understand the phenotypic changes associated with different GO terms, we categorised the phenotypic features based on feature type (cell context, morphology, DAPI intensity and texture, VP6 intensity and texture, state, etc.) as well as measurement type (summary statistics, spread statistics, distribution shape or distribution distance---the distance between perturbed and control distributions) (Fig [EV2](#msb199083-fig-0002ev){ref-type="fig"}E and [Table EV2](#msb199083-sup-0003){ref-type="supplementary-material"}). We then counted and scaled the number of features selected by a term classifier in the different categories (Figs [4](#msb199083-fig-0004){ref-type="fig"}B and [EV2](#msb199083-fig-0002ev){ref-type="fig"}D). Notably, the rank‐sum statistic was among the most selected measure by different classifiers indicating its biological relevance and robustness (Fig [EV2](#msb199083-fig-0002ev){ref-type="fig"}E).

Membrane transport‐related terms are predicted based on the increased number of cells and total cell area as well as local cell density and cell distance to islet edge (Figs [4](#msb199083-fig-0004){ref-type="fig"}B and [EV3](#msb199083-fig-0003ev){ref-type="fig"}). Surprisingly, the "ligand gated ion channel activity" and "voltage‐gated ion channel activity" terms are the most accurately classified (Fig [EV2](#msb199083-fig-0002ev){ref-type="fig"}A). Depletion of chloride transport genes also affected many texture and intensity measures of VP6, but most interestingly, it significantly decreased rotavirus infection (*P* \< 4.9e‐139, Figs [4](#msb199083-fig-0004){ref-type="fig"}B and [EV3](#msb199083-fig-0003ev){ref-type="fig"}A). These results illustrate the functional relevance of single‐cell aggregated measurements of cell morphology and context and suggest that chloride channels might be required for the spread or replication of rotavirus.

From image‐based data, KCML predicted a number of genes involved in mesoderm development (MSD). This was based on the spread and summary values of cell context, DAPI

The histology of HDLS features white matter degeneration including spheroids, loss of axons and myelin, and bizarre reactive astrocytes [@b1]--[@b3],[@b5],[@b7]--[@b11], which can descend along the pyramidal tract [@b1]--[@b5],[@b8],[@b10]. Although the cerebral cortex is generally spared, ballooned neurones can occasionally be present [@b1],[@b5],[@b8],[@b9],[@b11]. Subcortical U-fibres are well preserved [@b1]--[@b4],[@b6],[@b7],[@b10]. On the other hand, there have been some studies of the histology of SDLS [@b6],[@b12]--[@b22]. [Table 1](#tbl1){ref-type="table"} reviews the histology of SDLS in a total of 13 studies available, including ours. As this table suggests, the histology of SDLS can faithfully replicate that of its hereditary counterpart. The striking similarity of the histology of SDLS to that of HDLS strongly suggests that SDLS may also be genetically determined, as is HDLS.

In this work, we found that the spectral patterns of light fluence expected within the tissue can be modelled as an affine function of a few reference base spectra, independently of the specific distribution of tissue optical properties or the depth of the observation. We show how this principle can be employed to solve the spectral corruption problem without knowledge of the tissue optical properties, and significantly increase the accuracy of spectral optoacoustic methods. The proposed method, termed eigenspectra Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography (eMSOT), can provide quantitative estimation of blood sO~2~ in deep tissue. We demonstrate the superior performance of the method with \>2,000 simulations, phantom measurements and *in vivo* controlled experiments. Then, using eMSOT, we image oxygen gradients in the skeletal muscle *in vivo*, previously only accessible through invasive methods. Furthermore, we show the application of eMSOT in quantifying blood oxygenation gradients in tumours during tumour growth or O~2~ challenge, and relate label-free non-invasive eMSOT readings to tumour hypoxia; demonstrating the ability to measure quantitatively the perfusion hypoxia level in tumours, as confirmed with invasive histological gold standards.

eMSOT concept and application
-----------------------------

A new concept of treating light fluence in diffusive media/tissues is introduced, based on the observation that the light fluence spectrum at different locations in tissue is the result of a cumulative light absorption operation by tissue chromophores, such as haemoglobin. We, therefore, hypothesized that there exists a small number of base spectra that can be combined to predict any fluence spectrum present in tissue; therefore, avoiding the unattainable task of knowing the distribution of tissue optical properties at high resolution. To prove this hypothesis, we first applied principal component analysis (PCA) on 1,470 light fluence spectral patterns, which were computed by simulating light propagation in tissues at 21 different (uniform) oxygenation states of haemoglobin and 70 different discrete depths (Methods). PCA analysis yielded four significant base spectra, that is, a mean light fluence spectrum ([Fig. 1a](#f1){ref-type="fig"}) and three fluence Eigenspectra ([Fig. 1b--d](#f1){ref-type="fig"}). PCA was used due to its optimality in modelling the spectral variability of light fluence in a linear manner (see Methods). We found that the selection of three Eigenspectra offers a simple model with relatively high-

Gene therapy is being applied to various health problems, such as cancer, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases. The main challenge is to develop a method that delivers the transgene to selected cells, where a proper gene expression can be achieved. Several trials have aimed at introducing genes straight into human cells, focusing on diseases caused by single-gene defects, such as cystic fibrosis \[[@B2]\], hemophilia \[[@B3]\], adenosine deaminase deficiency \[[@B4]\], muscular dystrophy \[[@B5]\], and sickle cell anemia \[[@B6]\].

Ideally, gene therapy must protect DNA against degradation by nucleases in intercellular matrices so that the disposition of macromolecules is not affected. Transgenes should be brought across the plasma membrane and into the nucleus of targeted cells but should have no detrimental effects. Hence, interaction with blood components, vascular endothelial cells, and uptake by the reticuloendothelial system must be avoided \[[@B1]\].

For gene therapy to succeed, small-sized systems must internalize into cells and pass to the nucleus. Also, flexible tropisms allow applicability to a range of disease targets. Last but not least, such systems should be able to escape endosome-lysosome processing for endocytosis \[[@B7]\].

Viral gene therapy consists of using viral vectors which, given their structure and mechanisms of action, are good candidates or models to carry therapeutic genes efficiently, leading to long-term expression \[[@B8], [@B9]\]. They have the natural ability to enter cells and express their own proteins. Nowadays, most viral vectors used are retroviruses, herpes virus, adenoviruses, and lentiviruses \[[@B10]\]. However, viral vectors can cause several problems to patients, namely, toxicity, oncogenic effects, and immune and inflammatory responses. Because of safety and cost concerns, nonviral vectors have gained a lot of attention in the literature \[[@B1], [@B7]\].

Nonviral gene therapy has been explored by physical approaches (transfer by gene gun, electroporation, ultrasound-facilitated and hydrodynamic delivery) as well as chemical approaches (cationic lipid-mediated gene delivery, and cationic polymer-mediated gene transfer) \[[@B11]\].

Synthetic and natural cationic polymers (positively charged) have been widely used to carry DNA (negatively charged) and condense it into small particles, facilitating cellular internalization via endocytosis through charge-charge interactions with anionic sites on cell surfaces. In this category, we include polyethylenimine, polyam

As shown in [Table 3](#pone.0123466.t003){ref-type="table"}, absolute rates of 4.5% false alarms and 6.5% missed alarm error reduction have been achieved with the development dataset `bbc.dev`, based on a comparison of the results of iteration 1 with those of iteration 2. Further error reductions (4.4% of FA, 6.1% of MA) have been achieved by adding the third iteration to update the AMs for FP refinement. From these numbers, we can conclude that the performance improvements are significant when we retrain the acoustic models by adding the FPs that were refined in the previous iteration to supplement the training data transcription. Therefore, our proposed approach is very effective.

Performance of Transcription Systems {#sec015}
------------------------------------

To further explore the effectiveness of the proposed FP refinement approach, we now investigate how the refined FPs in AM training data affect a speech transcription system. Two speech transcription systems, LST and LST-FP, were built as described in the previous section. The speech transcription results for both the `bbc.dev` and `bbc.eval` datasets using these two systems are shown in [Table 4](#pone.0123466.t004){ref-type="table"}.

The iPTH level reflects the functional status of the parathyroid glands and has become one of the most important diagnostic tests for HPT. The iPTH level has been shown to be higher than normal in more than 90% of patients with HPT ([@ref10]).

The aim of the present retrospective study was to assess the relationship between Tc-99m MIBI parathyroid scintigraphy and serum iPTH, Ca, phosphorus (P) and albumin levels in suspicion of PHPT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
=====================

**Patients**

Between February 2010 and January 2012, 60 patients were referred to our Nuclear Medicine Department for Tc-99m MIBI parathyroid scintigraphy due to serum Ca and/or iPTH abnormalities consistent with HPT. The patients with severe kidney failure and/or those suspected to have secondary or tertiary HPT were excluded.

**Methods**

Serum iPTH (reference range: 11.0-79.5 pg/mL) was measured using commercially available immunometric assay, Ca (reference range; 8.4-10.6 mg/dL), P (reference range; 2.5-4.7 mg/dL) and albumin (reference range; 3.5-5.0 g/dL) were measured using spectrophotometric analysis.

**Dual Phase Tc-99m MIBI Parathyroid Scintigraphy**

Patients were injected intravenously with 555 MBq (range, 520-572) of Tc-99m MIBI. The image acquisitions were performed on a double-head gamma-camera equipped with LEHR collimator (GE Infinia, USA). Early and delayed neck planar images were obtained 10 and 90 and 180 min after injection. Anterior neck images were acquired for 10 min, in a 128x128 matrix. The camera was set for a 140 keV photo peak with a 20% window. Single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) acquisition was performed immediately after the first delayed planar image. The SPECT volume session included the neck and thorax. A 128x128 matrix was used and images were obtained with 60 projections at 30 sec over 360 degrees. Slice thickness was 4.42 mm. Data from SPECT were reconstructed using a 3-dimensional iterative algorithm (ordered-subsets expectation maximization with 2 iterations and 10 subsets). Images were smoothed with a 3-dimensional spatial Hann filter. Data from S

Subjects were supplemented with 16.000 IU or 0.266 mg of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, Hidroferol®, FAES FARMA) weekly, fortnightly, or monthly according to vitamin D baseline and PTH concentrations and according to the supplementation protocol designed by the Department of Infectious Diseases at Hospital del Mar ([Figure 1](#fig1){ref-type="fig"}). Those patients with vitamin D below 10 ng/mL were supplemented with 16.000 IU of cholecalciferol weekly. Patients with vitamin D above 10 ng/mL were replaced according to PTH values, though for those with PTH \> 70 ng/mL 1 dose fortnightly was used and those with PTH \< 65 ng/mL did not receive supplements. All subjects were reevaluated after 4--6 months and at every outpatient visit thereafter up to two years of follow-up. If vitamin D levels reached levels between 30 ng/mL and 100 ng/mL, the dose was modified to 16.000 IU fortnightly. When serum vitamin D reached levels above 100 ng/mL the dosage was modified to 16.000 IU every month. During the follow-up all patients were reevaluated 3 times. Subjects with normal vitamin D levels were not supplemented. Vitamin D toxicity was defined as concentrations above 150 ng/mL \[[@B31]\].

2.3. Statistical Analysis {#sec2.3}
-------------------------

Univariate analyses were performed with chi-square test and ORs and its 95% confidence interval was estimated by logistic regression.

Data of 300 participants from the 3 follow-up moments were pooled resulting in 798 registers. With the data arranged in this manner a Linear Mixed Model was performed to analyse the relationship between PTH and vitamin D, adjusted by TDF. In this model the individual (the identifier) was included as a random effect.

To analyse the factors associated to achieve the objective of 25(OH)D level above 20 ng/mL and PTH level below 65 pg/mL a chi-square analysis was done for the univariate analysis and a logistic regression model for the multivariate analysis; both analyses were done in patients with baseline 25(OH)D \< 20 ng/mL and baseline 25(OH)D \< 10 ng/mL.

Statistical analysis was performed with R Statistical Package (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria; Version

Current periodontal treatments aim to reduce bacterial plaque formation in the oral cavity using primarily physical and chemical (antibiotic) methods \[[@CR4], [@CR5]\]. However, current antibiotic treatment strategies exhibit non-specific activity, affecting beneficial organisms also present in the oral microbiome. Additional potential risks include the development of anti-bacterial resistant species, emergence of fungal opportunistic infections or *Pseudomonas* infection, and allergic reactions. Last, most current antibiotics have difficulty penetrating periodontal biofilms, and must be frequently administered, due to their transient activity in the oral cavity \[[@CR6]--[@CR8]\].

*Porphyromonas gingivalis* has been found to be associated with chronic periodontitis in 88% of sub-gingival plaque samples \[[@CR9]\]. Moreover, *P. gingivalis* and *S. gordonii* association enhances the disruption of host--microbe homeostasis and induces population changes in the subgingival biofilm, driving inflammatory periodontal diseases \[[@CR10]--[@CR12]\]. Previous work in our group has shown that *P. gingivalis* adherence to *streptococci* is driven by the interaction of the minor fimbrial antigen (Mfa) of *P. gingivalis* and the streptococcal antigen I/II (AgI/II) \[[@CR13], [@CR14]\]. From these studies, a peptide (designated BAR), was developed that potently inhibits *P. gingivalis*/*S. gordonii* adherence in vitro and reduces *P. gingivalis* virulence in a mouse model of periodontitis \[[@CR15]--[@CR17]\]. While efficacious, one of the challenges to free BAR administration is that it provides relatively transient inhibition of *P. gingivalis* in the oral cavity. Moreover, to treat established biofilms, relative to initial biofilm formation, higher concentrations of BAR are required.

Polymeric delivery vehicles provide one option to address these challenges, by offering prolonged and targeted delivery of active agents. In particular, for application to the oral cavity, polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) are easy to fabricate and produce stable formulations. From a delivery perspective, polymeric NPs may offer rapid degradation in the acidic environment of the oral cavity, while providing mucoadhesive properties due to the electrostatic interactions between NPs and gingival epithelium \[[@CR18]--[@CR20]\]. Furthermore, for more labile molecules like biologics, polymers have the potential to protect the functionality of the active agent and provide tunable release and prolonged delivery, while

For alleviation of postoperative pain, techniques, such as preoperative and postoperative intraperitoneal infusions of local anesthetics and direct injection of local anesthetics at the incision site, have been used \[[@B5][@B6][@B7][@B8][@B9]\]. In laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) where only 1 trocar-site incision is created, port-site injection of local anesthetics, such as bupivacaine hydrochloride or lidocaine has been commonly performed for postoperative pain reduction, as it is a relatively safe and economically feasible procedure. Conflicting results have been reported on the effect of port-site local anesthesia in gynecologic laparoendoscopy; however, the reporting studies had a retrospective design, had the procedures performed by a single surgeon, or included relatively simple, benign, adnexal surgeries with an operation time of less than 1 hour \[[@B10][@B11][@B12][@B13]\].

In this institution, almost all the gynecologic surgeries were performed with LESS, except in cases necessitating open procedures, such as ovarian malignancy with metastatic lesions. We sought to analyze the role of trocar-site bupivacaine injection in postoperative umbilical incisional pain alleviation in LESS, including various procedures, such as hysterectomy, myomectomy, cystectomy, and robot-assisted LESS, in this prospective, randomized trial.

Normal levels of Oxidative stress biomarkers were observed in control groups treated with Lf (200 mg and 300 mg/kg). On the other hand, renal GSH content was significantly reduced following PDC-administration, and a significant elevation of renal MDA content was detected. Treatment of rats with Lf, in its two doses, for 14 days prior to PDC injection significantly retrieved the altered levels of GSH and MDA ([Fig 2](#pone.0151486.g002){ref-type="fig"}).

Induction of AKI in rats with PDC increased the normal kidney contents of IL-18, IL-4, NFκB, IGF-1, and phosphorylated FoxO1. Pretreatment of rats with Lf significantly decreased PDC-induced elevation renal contents of IL-18 and IGF-1, with no significant difference between the effects of both doses of Lf ([Fig 3](#pone.0151486.g003){ref-type="fig"}).

Using a full-field visual stimulus while the head was rolled the severity of MdDS symptoms was successfully improved by ≥50% immediately after the treatment in 78% of 120 classic patients and in 48% of 21 spontaneous patients. The improvement was also shown in posturography findings (Figure [1](#F1){ref-type="fig"}). In the classic cases, the initial improvement rate of subjective findings regressed to 42% over 2 weeks upon returning home, but rose to 52%, 12 months later. The success rate of spontaneous cases fell to 14% 2 weeks after treatment, but then rose to 48%, 12 months later (Figure [2](#F2){ref-type="fig"}). For patients who did not have a 50% reduction, there was still a statistically significant reduction in subjective symptoms a year later compared to the pretreatment level (*P* = 0.005). There was a marked preponderance of females with MdDS, but there was essentially no difference in the response to treatment between genders (Figure [3](#F3){ref-type="fig"}). There was also the same tendency for a reduced rate of success in patients who had had the MdDS for long periods (Figure [4](#F4){ref-type="fig"}), or they were of an advance age (Figure [5](#F5){ref-type="fig"}). This was not universal, however. There were three patients with more than 20 years of symptom duration who were treated successfully. Thus, we were able to essentially reproduce the beneficial results of treatment for MdDS, a condition that had had no successful treatment prior to our earlier study ([@B1]). The medical community is generally unaware that the MdDS is a characteristic set of signs and symptoms, and the patients who came to us most frequently had a full medical workup with many medical tests, costing thousands of dollars by the time that these patients were diagnosed and referred. The knowledge that there is such a syndrome and further that it can be successfully treated would be a benefit to both patients and the medical system.

There was a significant reversion in improvements when patients traveled back home at week 2, more in women than in men (Figure [2](#F2){ref-type="fig"}). There are many reasons to account for the reversion. The major factors most probably were the long duration of traveling and anxiety. The rate of reversion when traveling home was higher in this study (36%) than in the previous study, in which only about

A direct comparison between neoadjuvant chemotherapy and endocrine therapy was reported by [@bib35], in which 239 postmenopausal women with untreated invasive breast cancers that were ER and/or progesterone (PgR) positive received either combination chemotherapy with doxorubicin and paclitaxel every 3 weeks for four cycles (*n*=118) or AI treatment with either exemestane (*n*=60) or anastrozole (*n*=61) for 3 months ([@bib35]). The clinical overall response, rates of pCR and disease progression did not differ significantly among the groups. The breast conservation rate was slightly higher in the AI groups at 33% compared with 24% in the chemotherapy arm. These findings support the hypothesis that AI therapy is an appropriate low toxicity neoadjuvant approach, but a definitive randomised study that compares neoadjuvant endocrine therapy to chemotherapy has yet to be reported. Ideally, a trial that compares the two approaches would take a predictive model forward into the clinical trial design, as subpopulations of breast cancer may benefit more from chemotherapy, while others from endocrine manipulation ([@bib42]; [@bib31]; [@bib32]).

More recently, the GEICAM cooperative group reported a randomised phase II trial of chemotherapy *vs* exemestane in pre- and postmenopausal women ([@bib1]). Ninety-five patients with localised ER+, PgR+, HER2− and CK8/18+ (immunohistochemistry marker for luminal subtype) breast cancer were randomly assigned to chemotherapy (epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide every 3 weeks for four cycles followed by docetaxel every 3 weeks for four cycles) (*n*=47) or exemestane (with goserelin if premenopausal) (*n*=48). Tumour response was measured by magnetic resonance imaging. More than 50% of the participants were premenopausal women (*n*=24 in the chemotherapy arm and *n*=27 in the hormonal therapy arm). The response rate was higher for chemotherapy in the premenopausal patients (18 of the 24 in the chemotherapy arm *vs* 12 of the 27 in the hormonal therapy arm, *P*=0.027), but in postmenopausal women and those with a low baseline Ki67, responses were comparable. The underperformance of exemestane and goserelin in premenopausal women may reflect the fact that this can be inadequate for endocrine therapy in some patients, with a failure to suppress ovarian function. Alternatively, primary endocrine therapy resistance is likely to be higher in a premenopausal population and a more accurate predictive model for endocrine therapy

Activities of Fusion Prophenoloxidase-GFP Expressed in S2 Cells {#s2a}
---------------------------------------------------------------

Three *Drosophila melanogaster* prophenoloxidase (PPO) cDNAs with GFP fused at the C-terminal (rPPO-GFP) were sub-cloned in S2 cells and over-expressed. When rPPO1, rPPO2 and rPPO3 were over-expressed, they exhibited different biochemical properties [@pone.0064106-Liu1]. If there is not enough Cu^2+^ in the culture medium, rPPO1 and rPPO2 have no activity. Some of the rPPO3 does have activity immediately after being expressed ([Table 1](#pone-0064106-t001){ref-type="table"}). The enzyme activities and fluorescence properties of each rPPO and rPPO1-GFP, rPPO2-GFP and rPPO3-GFP were studied and compared.

DISCUSSION {#s3}
==========

Breast Cancer, is now known to involve epigenetic abnormalities along with genetic alterations \[[@R13]\]. Epigenetic modifications are early events in breast carcinogenesis and could be usefulfor early detection, prognosis, and targeted therapy of breast cancer \[[@R14]\]. Post-transcriptional gene regulation by noncoding RNA commonly referred as microRNAs is a kind of epigenetic regulation \[[@R15], [@R16]\]. It has become one of the most dynamic and fast-growing fields in science. Despite the rapid advance of RNA research, the enzymes that post-transcriptionally modify RNA have been less investigated\[[@R17]\].

A post-transcriptional modification enzyme BCDIN3D O-methylates the 5′ terminal mono-phosphate group of the precursor of some miRNA, which increasedtumorigenic phenotypes and cells invasiveness\[[@R12]\]. To our knowledge, no one else has explored its clinical significance. Our study is the first to evaluate the prognostic value of BCDIN3D in breast cancer patients. Our finding that patients with BCDIN3D positive tumors had worse DFS than the BCDIN3D negative group supports previous biological function study results from other researchers. Interestingly, this association was found to be most significant among patients with TNBC. TNBC breast tumors lack ER, PR, and HER-2 expression and occupy 15-20% of all breast cancers. It is generally more aggressive, has higher rates of relapse and decreased overall survival \[[@R18]\]. As few biomarkers are widely considered to be predictive for TNBC prognosis, and thus predictive factors for TNBC are urgently need. Our findings suggest that BCDIN3D might serve as an important prognostic factor for TNBC patients.

Our study had several limitations, including the small data set, few cases of stage I patients, lack of validation in

Consistent with previous reports^[@CR9],[@CR29]^, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were the two most dominant phyla in the ileum. Unlike previous studies^[@CR9]^, we found significant differences between the bacterial composition of the cecum and colon at the phylum level. At the lower taxonomic level, previous studies using 300-day-old Laiwu pigs revealed that *Clostridium* and *Prevotella* were the most prevalent genera in the ileum and cecum, respectively^[@CR30]^. In another study, 90-day-old pigs showed a highly variable distribution of *Prevotella*, *Oscillibacter*, and *Succinivibrio* in the colon^[@CR9]^. The prevalent genera in these studies differed substantially from our study. This may be attributed to the differences in the breed, age, feed, and husbandry of the analyzed pigs. Additionally, in our study, the microbial community compositions varied across the different gut locations. Previous studies revealed that many members of *Escherichia-Shigella* and *Romboutsia*, which are most abundant in the ileum, contributed to the degradation of glucose and fructo-oligosaccharides^[@CR31],[@CR32]^. High populations of *Prevotella* and *Actinobacillus* in the cecum were previously associated with polysaccharide fermentation^[@CR33],[@CR34]^. Many members of *Lactobacillus* and *Streptococcus* (the prevalent genera in the colon) contribute to lactic acid production^[@CR35]^. Another study suggested that the enzymatic digestion and absorption of starch constitute the predominant functions of the small intestine, while the large intestine mainly functions to ferment non-starch polysaccharides via bacteria and produce SCFAs^[@CR36]^, which serve as important nutrients for the epithelium and body tissues. Therefore, the functional capacities of the prevalent bacteria were quite similar to the physiological functions of the pig intestine. This suggests that in each gut location, the prevalent bacteria play an important role in the physiological functions of the particular location. In the ileum of the high FCR pigs, most of the dominant OTUs belonged to *Streptococcus*, Ruminococcaceae, and Christensenellaceae. The OTUs associated with *Streptococcus* were linked to lactic acid-producing bacteria^[@CR35]^, and the OTUs associated with Ruminococcaceae were capable of producing SCFAs by fermenting dietary polysaccharides^[@CR37]^. The OTUs associated with

To estimate the time frame for a Bayesian Skyline analysis we first determined the TMRCA for the three clades in BEAST v1.6.1 \[[@pone.0123207.ref063]\]with a relaxed molecular clock method \[[@pone.0123207.ref064]\], using the D-loop data collected in this study together with sequences for *P*. *kindae* (GenBank numbers NC020008, JX946202, Zambia) and *P*. *cynacephalus* (GenBank number JX946200, Tanzania). BEAST implements a 'relaxed phylogenetic' method in which tree topology and branch lengths are estimated simultaneously from the data \[[@pone.0123207.ref063]\]. We selected a Yule tree prior (the most suitable prior for trees describing relationships between individuals from different species \[[@pone.0123207.ref063]\]) and employed a relaxed molecular clock with rates for each branch drawn independently from an uncorrelated lognormal distribution together with the HKY+G substitution model. To calibrate the dating estimate we used fossil calibrated dates obtained from whole mtDNA genome analysis \[[@pone.0123207.ref043]\]. Values were input as the middle 95% of a normal distribution on each MRCA prior. The split between *ursinus* and the rest of the sample set was set at 2.09 Ma (S.D. 0.3 Ma); and the split between *griseipes*, *kindae* and *cynacephalus* was 1.49 Ma (S.D. 0.2 Ma). We ran two replicates for 10 million generations with tree and parameter sampling every 1000 iterations. The runs were assessed in Tracer v1.4 \[[@pone.0123207.ref063]\] and the sampling distributions were combined in LogCombiner v1.6.1 with 25% burn-in. The consensus tree was generated in TreeAnnotator v1.6.1 and visualised in FigTree v1.3.1 \[[@pone.0123207.ref065]\].

Population sample {#Sec8}
-----------------

This study is based on the 2012 Survey on Chronic Diseases in Jilin, China^[@CR49],[@CR50]^. The survey data were collected from a multistage stratified cluster sample. The sample size has been estimated according to the prevalence of chronic disease in Jilin province. The sampling process included five stages. In the first stage, 9 cities (Changchun, Jilin, Siping, Liaoyuan,Tonghua, Baishan, Songyuan, Baicheng and Yanbian) were chosen from 32 districts/counties for inclusion in the study; they were identified by the proportion of the population, the location of the whole province and the race of their residents. In the second stage, towns were selected by stratified random sampling based on the size of the district. In the third stage, three committees which were near each selected towns were chosen by stratified random sampling. In the fourth stage, one village which was close to the selected committee was chosen by simple random sampling. In the fifth stage, individuals were chosen by cluster random sampling. Finally, 23050 subjects from 32 districts/counties were enrolled, and 21435 participants completed the survey (response rate: 84.9%)^[@CR49]^. The survey included three aspects: a face-to-face questionnaire interview by trained investigators, a physical examination (measurement of height, weight and blood pressure) and a laboratory examination. The study was performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Data in this study came from the epidemiologic investigation of the project (Survey on Chronic Diseases in Jilin, China, 2012), specifically from the part which contained information on participants with hypertension that were 18 to 59 years old. Ultimately, 4632 participants were included in the present study. The flowchart of the participants included in or excluded from the present study is shown in Fig. [1](#Fig1){ref-type="fig"}.Figure 1Flowchart of the participants included in or excluded from the present study.

Definition {#Sec9}
----------

Hypertension was defined as any blood pressure where the mean systolic blood pressure was equal to or higher than 140 mmHg and/or the mean diastolic blood pressure was higher than 90 mmHg, and/or the self-reported use of antihypertensive medication in the past two weeks after having had a diagnosis of hypertension by a physician at the county-level or above^[@CR51]^. After at least 5 

Second, if MB was considered to be present, the grade of systolic diameter narrowing was measured in a way that CT measurements were determined. With comparing the luminal diameter within the tunneled segments in end systole and end diastole. Moreover, we measured the length, depth, and intramyocardial of the bridged segment using offline quantitative coronary artery software, and then reached product and area of the tunneled segment measures.

Statistical analyses were performed with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The distribution of variables was assessed with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Quantitative variables with normal distribution were analyzed with a two-tailed Student's *t* tests. Nonparametric variables were analyzed with the Wilcoxon test. Data are reported as means ± SD. A *P* value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results {#s3}
=======

Forty-seven patients with confirmed LAD myocardial bridge on coronary CTA were included in this study. Patient ages ranged from 44 to 84 years, with an average age of 58.97±8.75 years, and there were 22 (46.8%) male and 25 (53.2%) female.

MB was found in 16 (34%) patients at CCA (identified), and it was not found in 31 (66%) patients (unidentified) based on compression sign. After intracoronary nitroglycerin injection in 7 other patient MB was revealed, so totally 23 patients (48%) showed MB in CCA. In identified group, the mean systolic compression of the tunneled segment was 43.12% ± 24.41 ranged from 20 to 90%. No significant correlation was found between the percentage of systolic compression and the length and depth of the tunneled segment in identified patients (r=0.73, *P*=0.18; r=1.09, *P*=0.15; respectively). Although, correlation between the percentage of systolic compression and product of myocardial bridging was borderline and not statistically significant (r=0.48, *P*=0.05) correlation between the percentage of systolic compression and the trapezoid area under the myocardial bridging was statistically significant (r=0.304, *P*=0.03).

Baseline characteristics of both study groups were similar ([Table 1](#T1){ref-type="table"}). The mean age of the patients in identified group was found to be 59.75±10.51

Cohort demographics and matching {#Sec3}
--------------------------------

For this single-institutional study, a total of 1408 patients that underwent THA were included for a retrospective data collection. The recruitment period was between January 2010 and December 2014. The institution at which the study was conducted is a high-volume orthopedic teaching hospital, where approximately 350 primary and 50 revision THA are done yearly. The inclusion chart is shown on Fig. [1](#Fig1){ref-type="fig"}. Inclusion criterion was an elective THA due to osteoarthritis after failed conservative treatment, severe osteonecrosis of the femoral head, rheumatoid arthritis and dysplasia. Fractures were excluded. Propensity score matching for the approach analysis was performed using the caliper technique with the caliper set at 0.2, using the following criteria: patient age at surgery, body mass index (BMI), gender, ASA scores, and surgery performed by one of the three senior surgeons. Senior surgeons (TL, LP and RH) were the three most experienced surgeons in the clinic, each performing at least 100 primary arthroplasties a year at the time of the study, for at least 3 years in each surgeon's case. The standard approach of the institution at the time of the study was the DAA. The criteria for choosing the approach were instrument availability and teaching purposes. The intra-surgeon distribution of approaches was without significant difference to the overall distribution of the clinic (*p* = 0.85) and there was no difference in number of procedures with each approach over the years.Fig. 1Patient selection flow chart

Surgical information {#Sec4}
--------------------

A standard, preoperative digital planning was performed using the mediCAD© (MediCAD, Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.) software based on the preoperative anterior-posterior pelvis x-ray, in order to facilitate implant and size choice. Both DAA and anterolateral Watson-Jones approach were equally used at the study center by the three senior surgeons for over seven years prior to patient enrolment. With the DAA, a cementless Versafit Trio Cup (Medacta, Castel San Pietro, Ticino, Switzerland) and either a cementless Quadra© or AMI© Stem (both Medacta, Castel San Pietro, Ticino, Switzerland) were used. The implants were used in combination with the Medacta extension

The purpose of this study and the accompanying literature review was to present our cases series with the aim to outline a best-practice therapeutic approach to treat the rare and debilitating condition that is SSEH. The etiology has yet to be precisely determined, although oral anticoagulants contribute as a risk factor. Prognosis is mostly determined by ASIA score upon presentation, although complete recovery from an initial ASIA score of A was observed. While there is strong support for the earliest possible decompressive surgery, the conservative approach remains a feasible option if spontaneous recovery is manifested. It is imperative to note, however, that decompressive laminectomy should be readily available should the patient's neurological status begin to worsen or not improve shortly after presentation. The importance of surgical availability cannot be overemphasized, as the inverse correlation between the time elapsed between ictus and the surgery and the resulting extent of recovery has been extensively documented.

In brief, we recommend that close neurological monitoring and early imaging be completed for any patient with suspected SSEH, especially in those with anticoagulation therapy. Once confirmed on imaging, rapid determination of those requiring surgical intervention should be based on the evolution of their neurological status from time of symptom onset to the latest neurological examination by a trained spine surgeon. Therefore, any patient without sign of improvement or any patient with deterioration in ASIA score should be emergently treated by surgery. More case series including both surgical and conservative treatment are required to identify and substantiate more parameters that will further refine the optimal therapeutic solution proposed.

The authors declare no conflict of interest.

All participants provided written informed consent. The study was approved by the Regional Board of Ethics in Stockholm (DNR 2006/151-31, 2009/819-32, and 2011/37-32).

Procedure {#sec009}
---------

The study was conducted at the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden. All parts of the protocol were led by an experienced physiotherapist, and each participant was tested on a single occasion. At arrival, written informed consent was provided and signed before height and weight were measured using a stadiometer and scale. Subsequently, each participant was interviewed, and for descriptive purposes information regarding his or her activities of daily living was assessed with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part II (UPDRS-ADL) \[[@pone.0135899.ref027]\], which is a 13-item questionnaire graded on a 4-point scale that is summarized into a total score (0--52, where a higher score equals more disturbance). Freezing of gait (FOG) was assessed with the Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOGQ), specifically developed for individuals with PD \[[@pone.0135899.ref028], [@pone.0135899.ref029]\]. Thereafter, the UPDRS part III (motor part) was performed to score disease and symptom severity and to define Hoehn and Yahr disease stage \[[@pone.0135899.ref030]\]. The daily levodopa equivalent dose (LED) was calculated as described by Tomlinson et al. \[[@pone.0135899.ref031]\]. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using kg/m^2^; information about age and years since diagnosis was collected through the interviewing process. Lastly, information regarding comorbidities and PD-related symptoms was collected.

Next, participants briefly practiced walking at participant-defined brisk, normal, and slow speeds and estimating perceived exertion using the Borg's Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale \[[@pone.0135899.ref032]\] so as to become familiar with the instructions. Participants were fitted with an accelerometer (sampling rate set at 30 Hz) attached to an elasticized belt and worn around the waist, the unit placed over the lateral side of the hip. The accelerometer used was a triaxial Actigraph GT3X+ (Actigraph, Pensacola, FL), which is widely used for the objective measurement of physical activity \[[@pone.0135899.ref013]\]. It is

In the systemic circulation, various factors may lead to sex differences in pharmacokinetics.\[[@B21]\] In a subgroup of women with bipolar disorders, phasic differences in lithium levels were observed.\[[@B22]\] Lower gastric acid secretion in reproductiveage women and prolonged gastrointestinal transit time during the luteal phase may result in sex-related or menstrual cycle variations in drug absorption. The volume of distribution may have sex-differences owing to differences in adiposity as well as menstrual cycle variations associated with changes in fluid retention and transcapillary fluid dynamics. Changes in hepatic microsomal oxidase systems may occur due to changes in levels of sex hormones, and interindividual genetic variations, such as polymorphisms in CYPs, will influence hormone metabolism.

In addition to phase I metabolism, it is also important to think about phase II metabolism in women as steroids undergo glucuronidation. UGTs are found in all sites where membranes/barriers are important, including the brain. Also, COMT is sexually dimorphic.

In contrast to the drug-metabolizing enzyme data, relatively little information is available concerning the transporters that govern the disposition of estradiol and its metabolites. With relevance to the brain, estradiol is a substrate of ABCB1, also known as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), while testosterone, progesterone are inhibitors of ABCB1. Sex hormones also seem to affect the brain permeability of various substances, including nutrients via alterations of paracellular\[[@B23]\] and transcellular\[[@B24]\] transport across the blood-brain barrier. Psychotropic medications that are substrates or inhibitors of these transporters need additional attention.

Menstrual-cycle dependent medication dosing may be better calculated by clinical response time than the drug\'s pharmacokinetic properties. This is because sex steroids act through both genomic and nongenomic mechanisms with different latency of effects. Perhaps individual variability in gene expression (e.g., due to epigenetic factors) could lead to different symptomatic periods, e.g., for some women immediately premenstrual, for some, at the initiation of menses, for some a week before menses, etc. Adding to the complexity is that apparently paradoxical responses may be observed because a metabolite may have opposite effects on the parent hormone.

Proposal for future research
============================

The concept of adjusting medication dosages with the ovulatory cycle in reproductive women warrants further studies in schizophrenia, as well as, in other medical illnesses in which ovarian hormones may affect the symptom manifestations and drug treatment responses.

Additionally, an adjusted qSOFA score was calculated by adding 1 point for patients with low qSOFA score (i.e. ≤1) and elevated PGA levels as defined above.

Data analysis {#Sec8}
-------------

Comparisons between groups were conducted using paired t-tests or Mann-Whitney U test for parametric and non-parametric analysis, respectively. Categorical variables were compared using Chi-square or Fisher's exact test. Kaplan-Meier analysis was employed to examine the association between PGA levels and mortality. Composite outcomes were analyzed using logistic regression models. The latter included confounders that were demonstrated to be significant in the univariate analysis. Additional sub-analysis was conducted for patients with high and low mortality risk (qSOFA above and below 2, respectively). Finally, qSOFA and adjusted qSOFA area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curve and its associated terms were calculated and their 95% CI compared. Missing values were omitted from the analysis. All analyses were 2-tailed and P ≤ 0.5 was considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS software (version 25 IBM, SPSS Inc).

Results {#Sec9}

A total of 103 patients were recruited, of whom 3 were excluded due to technical problems in PGA determination. The final cohort included 43 females and 57 males, with a median age of 79.5 (IQR 67, 87) years. Rates of hypertension, ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia were 62%, 21%, 37% and 42%, respectively. Mean heart rate and blood pressure on arrival to ED were 99 (±19.8) bpm and 130(±31)/72(±17.8) mmHg, respectively. 15% of patients demonstrated systolic blood pressure ≤100 mmHg and 9% had mean arterial pressure ≤ 65 mmHg. Median pH was 7.39 (7.35, 7.41) and the median anion gap was 10.3 mEq/L (8.73, 12.45). Anion gap ≥ 11 was demonstrated among 32/80 (40%) patients, of whom 22/80 (27.6%) had an AG ≥ 12 and 5/80 (6.3%) ≥ 16. Thirty two (32%) patients had qSOFA ≥ 2, of them 7/32 and 1/32 with score of

A long-term project began in 1978 to monitor the dynamics of tree species along the subtropical forest successional gradient. A permanent plot with an area of 1 ha was established in pioneer or advanced forest. The transitional forest has two permanent plots, one is located in buffer area (Plot 1) and the other is located in core area (Plot 2) of the reserve. Plot 2 has not been disturbed longer than plot 1. Height and diameter at breast height of each tree in a plot were recorded and used to estimate the biomass using allometric equations[@b36].

The seedlings cultivation experiment at Dinghushan Biosphere Reserve
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Seedlings of tree species *P. massoniana* were collected from an arboretum and grown from seeds until they are two-year-old. The height and basal diameter of all seedlings were very similar. 100 seedlings were transplanted into a large forest gap (\>2000 m^2^) in each of the three successional forests (pioneer, transitional and advanced) at DBR over four years. The central region of the gap where seedlings grew received full sunlight for most day time. All planted seedlings received the same tap water during dry seasons, but were not fertilized during the experiment. The number of survived seedlings was recorded monthly during the first 6 months and bimonthly for the remaining months of the experiment. At the end of the second year of the experiment, 10 seedlings were selected and the current-year leaves or needles of those selected seedlings were collected for measuring foliar N and P concentrations in the laboratory.

Discussion
==========

Here, we have investigated the partner loci involved in rearrangements with 8q24, namely *MYC*. We analyzed presenting cases of myeloma characterized by a range of different primary *IGH* translocation events and found evidence of a *MYC* translocation in 21% of samples, making it the most frequent translocation in presenting myeloma cases.

Although FISH analysis of 8q24 rearrangements found no significant association with primary translocation groups, we did find an enrichment for samples with a *MYC* breakpoint in samples that had a t(14;16) and a depletion of samples with a t(4;14) or hyperdiploidy when screened by the sequence capture technique. Other studies using FISH agree with our FISH-based results in that it has been reported that rearrangements at the *MYC* locus show a similar prevalence in hyperdiploid and non-hyperdiploid tumors^[@bib1]^ or show some trend to being associated with t(4;14).^[@bib3]^ The discrepancy between our capture results and those determined by FISH may lie in the technique used to study the abnormality. One study used both FISH and mapping arrays to examine *MYC* breakpoints and found that 33% of breakpoints detected by array were not detected by routine FISH analysis.^[@bib17]^ Therefore, a higher resolution assay, such as genome sequencing, may identify more breakpoints and explain some of the discrepant results. However, care must be taken regarding the frequency of sequence capture translocations within the primary translocation groups owing to the bias in sample selection and the relatively small number of samples studied.

It is notable that all groups find *MYC* rearrangements to be complex, often involving many chromosomes. We only capture the region surrounding *MYC* and are not able to detect any rearrangements downstream on the partner chromosome, which could result in inversions, insertions or duplications of DNA segments. Whole-genome sequencing of samples will provide more complex and detailed information regarding the final composition of the genome in these samples.

The translocations at 8q24 results in overexpression of *MYC* due to the colocalization of active superenhancers in the partner loci. The obvious examples of this belong to the known active enhancers in the B-cell lineage, the Ig loci, but in addition to these a series of previously unknown partners have also been identified.

As indicated in Table [1](#T1){ref-type="table"}, there is no significant differences in the pre-stimulation stage for all significant results of the LMS test (moderate concentration of Amyl Acetate, strong concentration of Isovaleric Acid and strong concentration of 1-Octen-3-ol) and NIRS (VWrSO~2~%) recordings under any of the stimulation parameters for both hemispheres of the OFC.

Discussion {#s4}
==========

Studies of MNS in the existing literature have primarily focused on the cortical activation of primary (S-I) and secondary (S-II) somatosensory cortex (Spiegel et al., [@B80]; Nihashi et al., [@B62]; Napadow et al., [@B61]; Zhang et al., [@B94]; Zotelli et al., [@B96]), improvement of gastric function (Ouyang et al., [@B66]; Chen et al., [@B10]; Tatewaki et al., [@B83]; Xu et al., [@B90]; Takahashi, [@B82]) and alleviating symptoms associated with nausea and vomiting (Tatewaki et al., [@B83]; Xu et al., [@B90]; Bai et al., [@B4]; Takahashi, [@B82]; Zhang et al., [@B94]; Zotelli et al., [@B96]; Lee and Fan, [@B50]). As the VN is the key contributor towards gastric acid secretion and mobility, the modulation of gastric function by MNS addressed a potential interaction between MNS and VN. This interaction is supported in animal models and human studies (Ouyang et al., [@B66]; Chen et al., [@B10]; Xu et al., [@B90]; Takahashi, [@B82]). In the current literature, low frequency MNS has indicated several functions in regards to gastric mobility that includes accelerated gastric emptying of

Each plan has an inhomogeneous dose distribution but to varying degrees. In comparison with the goals set by ICRU 50, the four dose distributions presented in Fig. [1](#acm20126-fig-0001){ref-type="fig"} exhibit large dose nonuniformities.[^12^](#acm20126-bib-0012){ref-type="ref"} The relative difference between the minimum and maximum dose to the prescription value exceeds 12% and the minimum dose is much less than 95% of the prescription --- dose gradients within these tumor volumes are greater than about 25%. A better descriptor for the degree of dose inhomogeneity may be represented by the standard deviation. Even though the plans exhibit large dose inhomogeneities with respect to ICRU 50, the relative standard deviation as compared with the prescription dose is relatively small, less than 1%, for two plans. In the case of CDVH\#4, the relative standard deviation is much larger, $\sim 10\%$. For the purpose of this discussion, plans with standard deviations greater than 2 Gy for prescription doses larger than 60 Gy will be referred to as plans with large dose inhomogeneities.

To investigate the relation of EUD with respect to dose inhomogeneity, a series of CDVHs were generated to model typical Peacock (Peacock Plan or CORVUS) patient plans (Fig. [2](#acm20126-fig-0002){ref-type="fig"}). Each cumulative dose volume histogram is characterized by a standard deviation (SD), to represent the degree of dose inhomogeneity, and plotted as a function of percent maximum dose, which is chosen to be 66.7 Gy. The range of standard deviation considered here is from 0.6 to 10 Gy. For each CDVH, the EUD is calculated over a range of linear‐quadr

CASE REPORT
===========

A 3-kg baby boy was born by spontaneous vaginal delivery at 34 weeks of gestation to a 37-year-old mother, G6P4A2, whose pregnancy was complicated by diabetes mellitus and toxemia, treated respectively by insulin and anti-hypertensive drugs prior to delivery. Prenatal ultrasonography reports were normal. At birth, the baby was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for respiratory distress related to an early neonatal infection. On the second day of life, bilious vomiting and meconium emission delay were noticed. An abdominal X-ray revealed double bubble sign with no air distally and the stomach was localized in the right side of the abdomen. An upper contrast study confirmed the diagnosis of complete duodenal obstruction and right sided stomach (Fig.1). Abdominal ultrasonography revealed liver located in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen and a spleen in the right one. Surgical exploration showed atresia of the distal portion of duodenum and of the proximal jejunum, multiple atresia of the remaining small bowel wrapping around its blood supply in a spiral manner resembling an apple peel, mesenteric defect, agenesis of the superior mesenteric artery and abdominal situs inversus (Fig.2). Nothing could be done peroperatively. The baby was kept perfused on a central venous catheter and died after 32 days.

![Figure 2: Apple peel configuration in addition to duodenal atresia. Multiple atresias were also present throughout length of small bowel.](jns-5-60.f2){#F2}

DISCUSSION
==========

Duodenal atresia is a relatively common anomaly with an estimated incidence of 1 in 3000 to 1 in 5000 live births \[1\]. It is also common for duodenal atresia to be associated with other anomalies mainly congenital heart disease and Down\'s syndrome \[1\]. Our case had duodenal atresia, multiple atresias including apple peel type, and situs inversus abdominus. The association of these two types of intestinal atresia is extremely rare and only five cases were reported before \[2\]. Our case is unique as it has additional association with situs inversus abdominus which is not reported earlier. The management of these patients is complex. The difficulty lies in the treatment of apple peel atres

### Differential expression of the hilA gene

The HilA protein is the master regulator of SPI-1, and increases or decreases in expression of the *hilA* gene typically have a corresponding increase or decrease on invasion (Lee et al., [@B25]). However, increases in *hilA* expression due to chloramphenicol (Figure [3A](#F3){ref-type="fig"}) did not always correlate with increased invasiveness (Figure [2](#F2){ref-type="fig"}); this is highlighted in isolate 530 as 16, 32, and 64 μg/ml of chloramphenicol significantly increased *hilA* expression without any corresponding changes on invasion. This lack of congruence between increased *hilA* gene expression and increased invasiveness was previously observed when the isolates were exposed to tetracycline (Brunelle et al., [@B5]). No changes in *hilA* expression were detected due to either ampicillin or streptomycin exposure in any of the isolates, which is consistent with the invasion data (data not shown).

![**Gene expression changes in *S*. Typhimurium at early-log growth after chloramphenicol exposure**. Real-time gene expression assays were performed on eight MDR *S*. Typhimurium isolates grown to early-log phase and exposed to different concentrations of chloramphenicol (0, 16, 32, and 64 μg/ml) for 30 min. The "^\*^" denotes a significant change in expression over the 30 min compared to the control (pre-incubation) (*P* \< 0.05). **(A)** Gene expression changes in the *hilA* gene. **(B)** Gene expression changes in the chloramphenicol-resistance *floR* gene (not present in isolate 4584). **(C)** Gene expression differences in the tetracycline-resistance genes in the eight isolates due to chloramphenicol exposure.](fmicb-05-00801-g0003){#F3}

### Differential expression of the floR gene

An increase in the expression of *floR* was significant at all concentrations of chloramphenicol in the seven isolates encoding the gene (Figure [3B](#F3){ref-type="fig"}). These data indicate that there is no direct association between the up-regulation of *floR* and the induced invasiveness in isolates 1434, 5317, and 1306. Therefore, *flo

Our study was carried out in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration, using the database of Centre for Weight and Eating Disorders of Portogruaro, a credited agency of the Regional Health System. Patients gave their written consent to the use of their data for both clinical and research purposes at the time of their first contact with the Centre. Since no new instrument or investigation were used, a specific request to the local ethics committee was not advanced, being valid the principle of the availability for research of the data gathered in the clinical practice.

All participants were assessed for self-perception of HRQoL using the WHOQoL-BREF \[[@B1]\] at the beginning of treatment. This questionnaire is a 26-item short version of the WHOQoL scale measuring the subjective perception of quality of life associated with physical and psychological health, social performance and environment's characteristics. The Physical Health scale specifically investigates activity of daily living, dependence on drugs and medical supports, level of energy, mobility, pain and discomfort, sleep and rest, work capacity. The Psychological Health scale explores body image and appearance, positive and negative feelings, self-esteem, spirituality and personal believes, cognitive functioning. The Social Relationship scale measures quality of social relationships, social support and sexual activity. Finally, the Environment scale evaluates individual's socio-economic conditions (as financial resources, freedom, physical safety and security) and the availability of facilities in living and working context (accessibility to health and social care, home environment, chances for acquiring new information and skills, recreation and leisure activities, physical environment and transport).

Items are scored on a Likert five-point scale, were "1" means severe discontent and "5" great approval; patients had to evaluate their quality of life considering the two weeks preceding the administration of the questionnaire. The mean score of items within each scale was multiplied by 4 in order to be comparable to those of the 100-items WHOQOL scale.

Finally, height and weight were measured to calculate the body mass index (BMI: kg/m^2^).

Statistical analysis
--------------------

Data were analyzed using SPSS Version 16.0 for Windows \[[@B16]\] and STATA 10.0 \[[@B17]\]. The statistical significance (alpha) was set at p \< 0.05. Firstly, data were inspected for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test.

Socio-demographic and clinical variables were compared among ED subgroups using the Kruskal-Wallis or Fisher's exact test

Discussion
==========

The data presented support the likely safety of CAM exercise interventions, as 832 participants were enrolled in 16 studies and 81% completed the studies without differential attrition by study arm or exercise modality.[@b58-jpr-6-247]--[@b75-jpr-6-247] Only one study reported negative side effects (increased shoulder pain and plantar fasciitis) in two study participants.[@b70-jpr-6-247] All studies reported that there were no serious adverse events.

The data also support some degree of efficacy of several of the CAM exercise interventions in improving overall FM symptoms and physical function. Taken as a whole, the data do not indicate that any one intervention type is consistently superior to another, though the strongest effects were for the exercise modalities with the largest number of trials: qigong (Std diff in means 0.47; *P* \< 0.000) and tai chi (Std diff in means 1.14; *P* \< 0.000). Further support for qigong comes from a trial excluded from this analysis. Stephens et al[@b76-jpr-6-247] randomized 30 children (ages 8--18) with FM to aerobics or qigong. There was no difference between study arms, although qigong was intended to be the control group. The qigong group did demonstrate significant within-group changes, indicating that pediatric CAM exercise interventions may be a promising area of research. This is critical, as few interventions address pediatric FM even though its recognition as a valid diagnosis is increasing. This may indicate that mind--body exercises may be a feasible therapeutic option across a wider range of developmental states.[@b76-jpr-6-247]--[@b80-jpr-6-247]

Case Definitions
----------------

Surveillance for MRSA was laboratory-based and involved nonrepeat MRSA cases. Case-patients were residents of east-central Saskatchewan with laboratory-confirmed MRSA infections identified from January 1, 1999, to March 31, 2002, by the local hospital or provincial laboratory. All MRSA isolates identified by the hospital laboratory were subsequently confirmed at the provincial laboratory by using standard protocols. Residential status was determined by the location of the patient\'s treatment facility because case-patient address information was unavailable. General patient demographic information was collected (date of birth, sex, date of sample collection, and invasiveness) for all case-patients. Invasive infections were defined according to the guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Active Bacterial Core Surveillance Program and included obtaining isolates from a normally sterile site, such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, pericardial fluid, surgical aspirate, bone, joint fluid, or internal body site ([www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/abcs/meth-case.htm](http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/abcs/meth-case.htm)). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing by microbroth dilution was performed according to NCCLS recommendations ([@R13]). Breakpoints used for mupirocin were as follows: susceptible, MIC \<4 mg/L; low-level resistance, MIC ≥4 and \<256 mg/L; high-level resistance, ≥256 mg/L ([@R14]).

Molecular Characterization of MRSA Strains
------------------------------------------

*mecA* and *nuc* genes from MRSA isolates were coamplified with a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Nucleic acid was isolated from 4--5 colony picks by boiling in a 2% (wt/vol) homogeneous suspension of Chelex 100 resin (Bio-Rad Laboratories Ltd, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Primer and probe sequences with their reaction concentrations are shown in [Table 1](#T1){ref-type="table"}. Master mix was composed of the Applied Biosystems TaqMan PCR Core kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) that uses reaction concentrations of: 1× PCR buffer A, 4.0 mmol/L MgCl~2~, 200 μmol/L dATP, 200 μmol/L dCTP, 200 μmol/L dGTP, 400 μmol/L dUT

The thermal lesion diameter that can be attained after 10 min of heating with transgastric and intraductal applicators is plotted in Fig. [10](#Fig10){ref-type="fig"} for a variety of acoustic attenuation coefficients and blood perfusion rates. Assuming a tumor attenuation of 68 Np/m and perfusion of 4.5 kg/m3/s (Table [1](#Tab1){ref-type="table"}), this study indicated that pancreatic tumors up to 2.5 or 2.7 cm diameter can be ablated within 10 min using the transgastric and intraductal approaches, respectively. Intraductal applicators produced slightly larger (1.1--2.5 mm in diameter) thermal lesions than transgastric applicators, particularly in tissues with lower attenuations. Variations in blood perfusion rates generally had more pronounced effects on thermal lesion diameters than did variations in acoustic attenuation coefficients. Variations in acoustic attenuation had a greater effect on lesion sizes at lower blood perfusion rates than at higher rates.Fig. 10The maximum thermal lesion diameter (T \> 52 °C) after 10 min of heating as a function of tissue attenuation, for a variety of blood perfusion rates for both transgastric (solid lines) and intraductal (dashed lines) applicators

Discussion {#Sec15}
==========

This study was performed to provide a broad and preliminary investigation of the feasibility of transgastric and intraductal approaches to ultrasound-based thermal therapy of pancreatic tumors. Such an approach would provide localized directionality of heating which RF, microwave, and laser ablation lack, without the acoustic window limitations faced by HIFU. Through patient specific modeling and parametric studies we have demonstrated that this technology would have the ability to treat tumors positioned \> 4--5 cm from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which ultrasound applicators sonicating from within the tract cannot access. Patient-specific simulations herein have demonstrated the ability of transgastric and intraductal ultrasound to generate therapeutic temperature distributions within the majority of the volumes of pancreatic tumors without damage to sensitive structures. Further, parametric studies identified appropriate treatment parameters for a variety of settings to avoid thermal damage to the duodenum or major blood vessels, and to identify limitations of the technology.

Sensitive tissues can be protected through careful placement of the applicator and through the use of sectored applicators. Guidance of applicator placement may be achieved clinically through MR

Supervised learning has already been applied to the problem of database curation and the development of text mining resources. However, using a web service like MScanner to perform supervised learning is a simple operation compared to constructing a boolean filter, gold standard training set, and custom-built classifier. MScanner may supplement existing workflows that use a pre-filter query by detecting relevant articles inadvertently excluded by the filter. Another possibility is using MScanner in place of a filter query when one is unavailable, and confirming relevance by passing on the results to a stronger classifier or an information extraction method such as that used by the Database of Interacting Proteins \[[@B25]\]. Supervised learning can also be used in other scenarios where relevant training examples are readily available and the presence of many relevant features hinders ad-hoc retrieval. For example, individual researchers could leverage the documents in a personal bibliography to identify additional articles relevant to their research interests.

Performance evaluation
----------------------

MScanner\'s performance varies by topic, depending on the degree to which features are enriched or depleted in relevant articles compared to Medline. The relative performance on different corpora also depends on the evaluation metric used. For example, ROC performance on PG07 shows lower overall ability to distinguish pharmacogenetics articles from Medline, but the right hand sub-plot of Figure [4](#F4){ref-type="fig"} shows higher recall at low false positive rates on PG07 than AIDSBio. Besides the topic itself, the size of the training set can also influence performance. For the complex topics curated by databases, many relevant examples may be needed to obtain good coverage of terms indicating relevance. Narrower topics, such as the Radiology corpus, require fewer training examples to obtain good estimates of the frequencies of important terms. Too few training examples, however, will result in poor estimates of term frequencies (over-estimates, or failure of important terms to be represented), degrading performance. The use of a random set of Medline articles as the set of irrelevant articles in training (Medline100K in the use cases we presented) can also influence performance in cross validation. It can inflate the false positive rate to some extent because it contains relevant articles that are not part of the relevant training set.

The score distributions for the Control corpus (Figure [3](#F3){ref-type="fig"}) were somewhat anomalous, with multiple narrow modes. This is due to the larger irrelevant corpus derived from Medline100K containing low-

A total of 133 (95·0%) patients experienced at least one of the 1162 AEs reported throughout the study (DLBCL, 93·1%; FL, 95·5%), which most frequently included erythema, neutropenia and asthenia (Table [3](#bjh16227-tbl-0003){ref-type="table"}). AEs were grade ≥3 in 54 (38·6%) patients (DLBCL, 48·3%; FL, 36·0%), most frequently neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, and were considered related to subcutaneous rituximab by the treating physicians in 76 cases (54·3%; DLBCL, 37·9%; FL, 58·6%), most frequently erythema and neutropenia (Table [3](#bjh16227-tbl-0003){ref-type="table"}). Study treatment was delayed in 32 (22·9%) patients due to AEs (DLBCL, 13·8%; FL, 25·2%), interrupted in one (0·7%; DLBCL, 0·0%; FL, 0·9%) and permanently discontinued in one (0·7%; DLBCL, 0·0%; FL, 0·9%); treatment withdrawal in the latter patient was due to pneumonia pneumococcal (Table [3](#bjh16227-tbl-0003){ref-type="table"}).

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
-----------------------------

TaqMan probes and primers for *VIM* (P/N: Hs00185584_m1: Applied Biosystems) were assay-on-demand gene expression products. All reactions were performed in duplicate, and a negative control lacking cDNA was included. We followed the manufacturer's protocol for PCR conditions. Stem-loop RT-PCR (TaqMan MicroRNA Assays; P/N: 002284 for miR-138; Applied Biosystems) was used to quantitate miRNAs according to the earlier published conditions ([@b23-ijo-41-03-0805]). To normalize the data for quantification of *VIM* mRNA and the miRNAs, we used *human GUSB* (P/N: Hs99999908_m1; Applied Biosystems) and *RNU6B* (P/N: 001973; Applied Biosystems), respectively, and we used the ΔΔCt method to calculate the fold-change. As a control RNA, we used Premium total-RNA from normal human kidney (AM 7976; Applied Biosystems).

Mature miRNA and siRNA transfection
-----------------------------------

As described elsewhere ([@b23-ijo-41-03-0805]), the RCC cell lines were transfected with Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and Opti-MEM™ (Invitrogen) with 10 nM mature miRNA molecules. Pre-miR™ (Applied Biosystems) and negative-control miRNA (Applied Biosystems) were used in the gain-of-function experiments, whereas *VIM* siRNA (Cat nos. SASI\_ Hs01_00044033 and SASI_HS01_00044036, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and negative control siRNA (D-001810-10; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were used in the loss-of-function experiments. Cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes for protein extraction (8×10^5^ cells per dish), 6-well plates for wound healing assays (20×10^4^ cells per well), in 24-well plates for the mRNA extraction and Matrigel invasion assays (5×10^4^ cells per well) and in 96-well plates for the XTT assays (3,000 cells per well).

This study provides a comprehensive description of the distribution of major malaria vector species in Uganda, reporting data from 48 of 121 administrative districts. *Anopheles gambiae* (*s.s.*) was the dominant endophilic vector across the majority of sites in Uganda with *An. funestus* and *An. arabiensis* generally observed at lower densities. *Plasmodium falciparum* infection rates of 5.5% in *An. gambiae* (*s.s.*) and 4.0% in *An. funestus* (*s.s.*) were higher than previously observed in Uganda \[[@CR38]\]. This may partially reflect differences in the assay methods used in this work compared to the previous study, ELISA *vs* Taqman, with the latter having increased sensitivity \[[@CR25]\]. Whilst the Prokopak-based collection method precludes the estimation of entomological inoculation rates, these data suggest high rates of transmission across Uganda despite widespread conventional LLIN use \[[@CR19], [@CR39]\]. These data corroborate early work which has revealed a relatively limited impact of both DDT and pyrethroid based vector control on epidemiological indices \[[@CR14], [@CR15]\] thereby highlighting the need for alternative vector control technologies.

Three additional potential vector species were detected: *An. parensis*, *An. pharoensis* and *An. rufipes*. All three species have been recorded in Uganda and in parts of their range they have been found to be sporozoite-positive \[[@CR40]\]. It is possible that these species may be malaria vectors in some of the study locations, and whilst the single specimen of *An. pharoensis* was positive for *P. falciparum* DNA, these species were captured at very low densities in our indoor-collections. It is possible that these species might have a role in the maintenance of residual transmission and in the transmission of filarial and viral infections \[[@CR40]\].

Three known pyrethroid resistance-associated variants were widely distributed across the country. The knockdown resistance mutations (*Vgsc*-1014F/S) were near or at fixation in *An. gambiae* (*s.s.*) populations as expected from earlier studies \[[@CR6], [@CR11], [@CR41], [@CR42]\]. The presence of the Vgsc-1014F mutation has been reported sporadically in the region \[[@CR41], [@CR43]\] and despite evidence that it may confer higher rates of

Accurate modelling requires apoptotic proteins in parental but mostly NFκB-driven anti-apoptotic proteins in conditioned cells {#Sec5}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Acquired TRAIL resistance during conditioning of cells to IZI1551 caused severe modifications in expression levels of anti-apoptotic proteins XIAP and FLIP, as well as in the activation status of pro-survival proteins NFκB, IκBα, AKT, ERK, and pro-apoptotic protein PARP over time (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 48 h) (Fig. [3a](#Fig3){ref-type="fig"} and Figure [S2a](#MOESM1){ref-type="media"} and the heatmap Figure [S2b](#MOESM1){ref-type="media"} which includes the values of the untreated and treated samples). We analyzed the differences in normalized protein expression in parental and IZI1551-conditioned A375 cells for each time point. The largest overall differences between the profiles of parental and IZI1551-conditioned A375 cells were observed at the three different time points that might be referred to as: initiation phase (4 h), execution phase (16 h), and adaption phase (48 h) (Fig. [3b](#Fig3){ref-type="fig"}). To analyze the network modularity within these three phases, we performed systematic in silico protein knock-out experiments in the parental and IZI1551-conditioned cells at 4, 16 and 48 h. We used the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) as selection criteria to verify if the selective removal of each individual node can be compensated by the network. Based on this analysis mostly pro-apoptotic proteins were shown to play an essential role in the execution and adaption phase of parental cells in response to IZI1551 treatment. In contrast, pro-apoptotic proteins only played a minor role in IZI1551-treated conditioned cells, because right from the initiation phase and through the execution and adaptation phases NFκB-dependent anti-apoptotic proteins were shown to be the most indispensable for accurate modelling of the system (Fig. [3c](#Fig3){ref-type="fig"}).Fig. 3Accurate modelling requires apoptotic proteins in parental but mostly NFκB-driven anti-apoptotic proteins in conditioned cells. **a** The expression pattern of AKT, ERK, FLIP, XIAP, IκBα, NFκB(p65), and

Dietary antigens play critical roles in the development and induction of IELs. Continued feeding with the antigen-minimized diet to germ-free (GF) mice caused a gradual reduction in the numbers and cytotoxic effects of CD8αβ IELs ([@b18-ksmcb-42-313]). In SPF mice, protein-free diet supplemented with equivalent amounts of amino acid arrested the development of TCRαβ IELs after weaning ([@b26-ksmcb-42-313]). These two reports clearly demonstrated the importance of dietary proteins particularly in the development of CD8αβ IELs in GF and SPF conditions respectively. However, the effect of commensal microbiome in the development of diet induced CD8αβ IELs has not been explored. To address this issue, we deprived commensal microbiota and/or dietary antigens and examined the generation of CD8αβ IELs before or after weaning. As a result, we found that in the absence of commensal flora, the development of CD8αβ IELs specific to dietary antigens was significantly delayed. On the other hand, in the absence of dietary antigens, microbiota could induce only about 10% of the CD8αβ IELs compared to those of SPF mice, indicating that intestinal bacteria cannot substitute dietary antigens. Interestingly, delayed supplementation of microbial and dietary antigens was very inefficient for the induction of CD8αβ IELs. Taken together, these results indicate that the presence of commensal microbiota in early life is essential for the proper development of diet-induced CD8αβ IELs at later time points.

Our patients, 100 males and 30 females, had been newly diagnosed with type II DM. The refraction values and fpg levels were measured twice in all patients. The average values of the initial measurements were as follows: fpg level, 415 mg/dl; average refractive value, +2.5 D (Dioptres). The average end-of-period measurements were fpg, 203 mg/dl; average refractive value, +0.75 D. The refractive values were different between the two measurements ([Table-I](#T1){ref-type="table"}). There is a statistically significant difference between after four weeks measurements with initially measurements (p\<0.05) (paired samples t test).

***Note:*** There is a statistically significant difference between after four weeks measurements with initially measurements of fasting plasma glucose (fpg) levels (p\<0.05) and there is a statistically significant relationship between changes in fpg changes with glasses ID (p\<0.05) and the disappearance of blurred vision (to be greater than 50% success rate) were statistically significant (p\<0.05).

The changes were identified; end-of-period measurements average fpg levels, 51.08%; average refractive values, 60% ([Table-I](#T1){ref-type="table"}). These change (end-of-period) were statistically significant (p\<0.05) (spearman correlation). Also were detected upon all these results, the absence of any age and sex effects (p\>0.05). Another noteworthy finding is the detection of blurred vision in all the patients in the first condition that was eliminated with the use of corrective lenses after 4 weeks. The disappearance of blurred vision (to be greater than 50% success rate) were statistically significant (p\<0.05).

DISCUSSION {#sec1-4}
==========

Hyperglycemia is the major cause of transient refractive changes in diabetic patients. In the 19th century it was recognised that the vision of diabetic patients is influenced by

Although alcoholism often has serious emotional, economic, behavioral, physical, and social consequences for alcohol abusers and their partners, children who live with alcoholic parents often experience negative psychosocial outcomes. In general, the literature supports that COAs are more likely to develop externalizing problems such as conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, delinquency, and attention deficit disorder (e.g., \[[@b21-ijerph-06-03156],[@b22-ijerph-06-03156]\]), and are at elevated risk for internalizing behaviors such as depression and anxiety \[[@b23-ijerph-06-03156],[@b25-ijerph-06-03156]\]. In addition, offspring of alcoholics drink earlier (e.g., \[[@b24-ijerph-06-03156]\]), are more likely to develop alcohol use problems \[[@b25-ijerph-06-03156]--[@b28-ijerph-06-03156]\], progress from initial alcohol use to alcohol use disorder more quickly \[[@b25-ijerph-06-03156],[@b28-ijerph-06-03156]\], and are less likely to mature out of moderate to heavy drinking \[[@b30-ijerph-06-03156]\].

Although, in general, the literature supports an elevated risk for negative psychosocial development among children with a family history of alcoholism (e.g., \[[@b31-ijerph-06-03156]\]), many children who live with an alcohol-abusing parent display normal psychosocial development (e.g., \[[@b32-ijerph-06-03156]--[@b34-ijerph-06-03156]\]). With respect to parental alcohol abuse and IPV, Nicholas and Rasmussen \[[@b33-ijerph-06-03156]\] found that when they controlled for childhood abuse and IPV, parental alcohol use did not predict reports of aggression or depression among college-student adult children of alcoholics (ACOAs).

Undoubtedly, characteristics of the family environment contribute to the adjustment of COAs. Thus, the challenge for researchers is to refine the definition of risk by identifying specific mechanisms that lead to diverse outcomes among children raised by alcoholic parents. Although alcohol misuse during gestation has well-documented risk for physical and central nervous system insults that may result in cognitive, affective, growth, and morphologic sequelae \[[@b34-ijerph-06-03156]\], our theoretical explanations focus on factors relevant to alcohol-abusing couples that with intervention may be most amenable to change.

2.1.. The Effects

Not everyone is happy, however. Gaming industry associations and some mental health professionals and academics have argued that, given the current state of knowledge regarding the impact of gaming on individuals, the inclusion is premature, and is likely to lead to overdiagnosis while also feeding into moral panic about on-line gaming and stigmatization of gamers.

Critics making these arguments cite the APA's decision to enter 'internet gaming disorder' as a 'condition for further study', in the 2013 *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders* (DSM-5), a designation signifying that further research is required before it can be accepted as a valid diagnostic category.

WHO's Pozynak points out that the inclusion of gaming disorder in ICD-11 was based on the conclusions of experts from more than 20 countries, as well as evidence of increasing internet-gaming-related treatment demand.

As for concerns regarding over-diagnosis and stigmatization, Poznyak is sceptical. "The inclusion of gaming disorder in ICD-11 will facilitate appropriate diagnosis and treatment as well as the monitoring, surveillance and research required to get a clearer picture of the prevalence and impact of the condition," he says, adding that WHO is currently working with partners on the development of an evidence-based screening and diagnostic interview to support clinicians.

According to Dr Charles O\'Brien, Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, and chair of the APA committee that decided to include internet gaming disorder in DSM-5 under the 'condition for further study' rubric, the classification is currently under review.

"There have been a lot of developments since 2013, and we have the option to change the disorder classification if we consider it appropriate," says O'Brien.

Higuchi welcomes any move towards clearer diagnosis, and greater recognition of the disorder. "The ICD-11 classification will help with that," he says. He also welcomes WHO's decision to publish guidelines on physical activity for children under 5 years of age, which recommend, among other things, that children in their first year of life should have no screen time and very little in their second, while those aged 2 to 4 years, should spend no more than an hour a day in front of a screen.

"It's time to set limits," Higuchi says.

Total RNA, mRNA and miRNA, was extracted using the Biozol Reagent (Bioer Technology, Hangzhou, China). Huh-7 cells were first lysed in Biozol then chloroform was added on top of the cell lysate. Following centrifugation at 12,000 rpm at 4°C for 15 min, RNA in the aqueous layer was precipitated using isopropanol. Followed additional centrifugation at 12,000 rpm at 4°C for 15 min, the precipitated RNA was then washed using 75% ethanol and dissolved in DPEC water.

Reverse transcription and RNA quantification using qRT-PCR {#s2-4}
----------------------------------------------------------

miR-29a and the housekeeping gene RNU6B were reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) using the *Taq*Man microRNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions and using *Taq*Man microRNA assays (Applied Biosystems). Total cellular mRNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

The mRNA and miRNA expression levels were quantified using StepOne™ real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) (SN: 271000301; Applied Biosystems). The amount of miR-29a was then calculated relative to the amount of the housekeeping gene RNU6B, and the mRNA expression level of SREBP-1c and CAV1 was then normalized to the housekeeping gene B2-microglobulin (B2M) using *Taq*Man sterol regulatory element binding factor-1 (SREBF1), CAV1 and B2M assays (Applied Biosystems).

Transfection of oligonucleotides {#s2-5}
--------------------------------

In order to perform mRNA quantification and intracellular LD imaging, Huh-7 cells were transfected with 25 nM of miR-29a mimics or antagomirs, or SREBP-1 siRNAs (used as a positive control in this study) in 96-well plates by means of the Hiperfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) using reverse transfection method according to the manufacturer's instructions. In order to quantify TGs as well as viral load, Huh-7 cells were transfected in 24-well plates by the Hiperfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) using the traditional transfection method according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were cultured under normal conditions (37°C and 5% CO~2~).

Overall, by scrutinizing both the dissipative and optical cavity behaviors of the planar metasurface, we introduce Equations [(5)](#advs793-disp-0005){ref-type="disp-formula"} and [(14)](#advs793-disp-0014){ref-type="disp-formula"} as design guidelines to realize perfect absorption in the ultrathin semiconductor film at the target wavelength. We must point out that Equation [(5)](#advs793-disp-0005){ref-type="disp-formula"} is valid for only the structure with semiconductor film much thinner than the wavelength, that is, in the ultrathin regime, so now we consider a limiting case where *d* ~3~ = 0. This gives ψ~234~ = π. Substituting this result into Equation [(13)](#advs793-disp-0013){ref-type="disp-formula"} gives *d* ~2~ = λ/(4*n* ~2~) corresponding to the quarter‐wavelength thickness limit. *d* ~3~ = 0 also gives *E*(*z* = *d* ~2~) = 0 because the electric field cannot penetrate into the perfect electric conductor substrate; the resultant $\int_{0}^{d_{2}}{|E(z)|^{2}dz}$ is approximated to be equal to \|*E* ~0~\|^2^/2. Perfect absorption leads to κ~2~ =*λn* ~1~/(2*πn* ~2~ *d* ~2~). For the quarter‐wavelength thickness limit, we have κ~2~ = 2*n* ~1~/π. Therefore, perfect absorption can be achieved in the ultrathin semiconductor film only for spectra where the extinction coefficient of the semiconductor material is larger than 2*n* ~1~/π. Otherwise, although the planar metasurface absorber can resonate at the target wavelength determined by Equation [(14)](#advs793-disp-0014){ref-type="disp-formula"}, the absorption can never approach 100%.

### 2.1.2. Experimental Demonstration {#advs793-sec-0050}

Now we experimentally prove the concept. Without losing generality, germanium (Ge) was used for the semiconductor film with alumina (Al~2~O~3~) for the transparent spacer, air for medium [(1)](#advs793-disp-0001){ref-type="disp-formula"} and

In this paper, energy consumption is considered from the perspective of a task requester \[[@B13-sensors-19-04974],[@B36-sensors-19-04974],[@B37-sensors-19-04974]\]. The objective of the optimization is to obtain an efficient offloading strategy that enables all PMs to complete tasks with minimal average total energy consumption. Therefore, the optimization problem can be formulated as $$\begin{aligned}
 & {\min\overline{E}\overset{\Delta}{=}\lim\limits_{t\rightarrow + \infty}\sup\frac{1}{t}\sum\limits_{\tau = 1}^{t}{\sum\limits_{m = 1}^{M}℧\left\{ E_{m}\left( \tau \right) \right\}},} \\
{{s.t.}} & {C1:\overline{Q}\overset{\Delta}{=}\lim\limits_{t\rightarrow + \infty}\sup\frac{1}{t}\sum\limits_{\tau = 1}^{t}{\sum\limits_{k = 0}^{M}℧\left\{ Q_{k}\left( \tau \right) \right\} < \infty},\mspace{720mu}} \\
\end{aligned}$$ where ℧ is the sign for averaging, and $\overline{E}$ represents the average energy consumption of the task. The constraint condition means that all queues are completed under convergence, where $\overline{Q}$ represents the average queue length of tasks.

5. Problem Solution {#sec5-sensors-19-04974}
===================

The optimal offloading decisions are obtained by employing a Lyapunov algorithm and greedy algorithm under the condition of ensuring the stability of task computation queue and meeting the deadline of task execution.

5.1. Offloading Decision {#sec5dot1-sensors-19-04974}
------------------------

The offloading decision vector at time *t* is expressed as $$a\left( t \right) = \left\lbrack a_{m}\left( t \right) \middle| m \in \left\{ 1,2,\ldots M \right\},a_{m}\left( t \right) \in \left\{ 0,1,\ldots M \right\} \right\rbrack,$$ where $a_{m}\left( t \right) = k$ means that PM *m* offloads the task to computation node *k

Several extended-cycle OCs are currently available ([Table 1](#t1-ijwh-2-235){ref-type="table"}). In September 2003, the FDA approved an extended-cycle OC in an 84/7 dosing regimen, EE 30 μg/levonorgestrel (LNG) 150 μg (Seasonale^®^; Duramed Pharmaceuticals, Cincinnati, Ohio). A patient takes 84 days of the combined active pill followed by 7 days of placebo pills. This regimen establishes 4 scheduled withdrawal bleeding episodes per year.[@b12-ijwh-2-235] Subsequently, in May 2006, the FDA approved a variation of this product (Seasonique^®^; Duramed Pharmaceuticals), with the same combined active pill containing LNG 150 μg and EE 30 μg, followed by 7 days of 10 μg EE pills, instead of placebo (EE 30 μg/LNG 150 μg + EE 10 μg). The rationale for the evolution of EE 30 μg/LNG 150 μg to EE 30 μg/LNG 150 μg + EE 10 mcg is that replacing the hormone-free interval with 7 days of EE provides the potential for greater ovulation suppression, possibly leading to greater effectiveness. In addition, patients may experience less break-through bleeding and fewer estrogen withdrawal symptoms, possibly improving compliance.[@b13-ijwh-2-235] The FDA later approved EE 20 μg/LNG 90 μg (Lybrel^®^; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) in 2007, which is administered as a combined active pill containing LNG 90 μg and EE 20 μg in a continuous fashion, 365 days per year.[@b14-ijwh-2-235],[@b15-ijwh-2-235]

An OC formulation providing low-dose continuous EE received FDA approval in October 2008 (LoSeasonique^®^; Duramed Pharmaceuticals). This product delivers 84 days of EE 20 μg and LNG 100 μg, followed by 7 days of EE 10 μg (EE 20 μg/LNG 100 μg + EE 10 μg). The reason for the development of this product was to offer patients a very low dose extended-cycle OC. The novel formulation provides the lowest dose of EE available in extended-cycle regimens thus far, combined with EE during the placebo week. The lowest dose of EE in OCs currently available in the United States is 20 μg, which is likely near the lowest dose required to produce contraceptive efficacy.[@b16-ijwh-2-235] Decreased estrogen exposure may result in fewer estrogen-

Let us now focus on metallized rectangles and lines, i.e. when the mask width is lower than *L*~*c*~ while the mask length is significantly longer. [Figure 6](#f6){ref-type="fig"} shows the resulting cracking of the metallized PDMS surfaces in the case of metallization of rectangles (100 × 500 μm^2^) and lines (150 μm by 1 mm). Two different thickness of chromium are used: 5 nm ([Fig. 6a,b](#f6){ref-type="fig"}) and 10 nm ([Fig. 6c--f](#f6){ref-type="fig"}). The gold has been removed (see Methods) in [Fig. 6e](#f6){ref-type="fig"} to reveal the chromium and the chromium/gold has been removed (see Methods) in [Fig. 6f](#f6){ref-type="fig"} to reveal the PDMS topography.

In the case of 5 nm of chromium, no cracks were observed in any of the smallest rectangles -- [Fig. 6a](#f6){ref-type="fig"}. However, cracks orthogonal to the metallization boundary are observed in the lines having a thickness of 150 μm -- [Fig. 6b](#f6){ref-type="fig"} -- the spacing of these cracks is 296.3 ± 112.4 μm. We note that this value is, on average, larger than the value of *L*~*c*~ (217.2 ± 13 μm) obtained for the same chromium thickness and a large surface metallization. Nevertheless, the average crack-free surface obtained for the 150 × 1000 μm^2^ lines is 4.4 ± 1.7 × 10^4^ μm^2^ (i.e. 150 × 296 ± 112 μm^2^) while the value of obtained for Cr/Au (5 nm/100 nm) blanket metallization is 4.7 ± 0.6 × 10^4^ μm^2^ -- indicating that the crack-free surface is almost conserved irrespective of mask shape -- contrary to the value of the crack spacing. Considering the 100 × 500 μm^2^ crack-free rectangles ([Fig. 6a](#f6){ref-type="fig"}), the surface is 5 ×

A total of 121 patients with resectable, early-stage breast cancer diagnosed as stage IIA (T1, N1, M0 or T2, N0, M0), IIB (T2, N1, M0 or T3, N0, M0), or IIIA (T1--2, N2, M0 or T3, N1--2, M0) were treated with NAC between 2007 and 2013. Tumor stage and T and N factors were stratified based on the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors, UICC 7th Edition \[[@CR13]\]. Breast cancer was confirmed histologically by core needle biopsy and staged by systemic imaging studies using computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography (US), and bone scintigraphy. Breast cancer was classified into subtypes according to the immunohistochemical expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 2, and Ki67.

All patients received a standardised protocol of NAC consisting of four courses of FEC100 (500 mg m^−2^ fluorouracil, 100 mg m^−2^ epirubicin, and 500 mg m^−2^ cyclophosphamide) every 3 weeks, followed by 12 courses of 80 mg m^−2^ paclitaxel administered weekly \[[@CR14], [@CR15]\]. Thirty-five patients had HER2-positive breast cancer and were additionally administered weekly (2 mg kg^−1^) or tri-weekly (6 mg kg^−1^) trastuzumab during paclitaxel treatment \[[@CR16]\]. All patients underwent chemotherapy as outpatients. Therapeutic anti-tumor effects were assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria \[[@CR17]\]. Pathological complete response (pCR) was defined as the complete disappearance of the invasive component of the lesion, with or without intraductal components, including in the lymph nodes. Patients underwent mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery after NAC. All patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery were administered postoperative radiotherapy to the remnant breast. Overall survival (OS) time was the period from the initiation of NAC to the time of death from any cause. Disease-free survival (DFS) was defined as freedom from all local, locoregional, and distant recurrences. Distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) time was defined as time to distant metastasis or death if the latter event occurred before a distant metastasis was diagnosed

Preparation of tea brew {#Sec5}
-----------------------

Tea brew was prepared according to the conventional method. Deonized water (500 ml) was boiled in a glass beaker placed on a hot plate. At the onset of boiling, heating was terminated and the tea leaves (5.0 g) were added to boiled water. The beaker was then covered with a watch glass. Magnetic stirrer was used at a constant speed to maintain a homogenous sample. A volume of 1.0 ml was withdrawn at different time intervals (0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20 min) and centrifuged. The supernatant was assayed for their phenolic and flavonoid content by spectrophotometry. Gallic acid, caffeine, epicatechin and epigallocatechin gallate were quantified by Reversed Phase High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC). Antioxidant activity was assayed by DPPH radical scavenging and Ferric reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) methods.

Determination of phenolic content {#Sec6}
---------------------------------

Total phenolic content was determined by Folin Ciocalteu method \[[@CR26]\]. Samples (25 μl) were diluted up to 1500 μl with deionized water. Folin Ciocalteu's reagent (1 N, 250 μl) was added to the samples (500 μl), and the mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 2 min. Sodium carbonate solution (10 %, 1.25 ml) was then added and incubated for 45 min in the dark at room temperature. The absorbance of the resulting solution was measured at 760 nm against a blank prepared with deionized water. Calibration curves were constructed with gallic acid and (−)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) standards. The total phenolic content was expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE) mg/g of tea leaves as well as EGCG equivalents mg/g of tea leaves. Tea samples brewed independently were analyzed in replicates (*n* = 6).

Determination of flavonoid content {#Sec7}
----------------------------------

The flavonoid content was measured by the aluminum chloride colorimetric assay \[[@CR27]\]. Tea brew (25 μl) collected at different time intervals were diluted with deionized water up to 500 μl and mixed with sodium nitrite (5 %, 30 μl). After 5 

Childbearing postponement is increasingly relevant to demographic trends. Although most European countries have registered a similar decrease in fertility rates of young women, they significantly differ by the intensity of fertility recuperation, i.e. compensatory increase in fertility rates of women at a higher age above 30 \[[@B9]\]. As a result, a large cross-country variation in current fertility rates exists \[[@B5]\]. Accordingly, there is a tendency to reconsider public policies related to fertility and assisted reproductive technology (ART) support at national levels as well as within the EU: ART policies have definitely become much discussed topics \[[@B10]\]. Moreover ART treatments have generated important policy questions regarding their cost-effectiveness and safety \[[@B11]\].

ART use widely varies among European countries: despite the fact that some European countries do not provide complete statistics on ART, in 2009 the average number of treatment cycles per 1 million inhabitants ranged from 166 in Moldova to 2726 in Denmark \[[@B12]\]. Since it is rather improbable that countries would significantly differ regarding the share of infertile couples within their populations, the wide range in ART use may result from an unequal access to it \[[@B13],[@B14]\]. It was estimated that while circa 3000 couples per 1 million inhabitants may be eligible for ART, only half of them do request it \[[@B15],[@B16]\]. Provided that each couple needs on average more than one treatment cycle, the real need would exceed 2500 cycles. In 2009, Denmark, Iceland, and Belgium ranked above this estimated number while other European countries ranked well below it. Scandinavian countries met levels of utilization that approximated demand \[[@B13]\] while most European countries have probably not met the rising need for ART yet. However financial, medical, psychosocial, moral or ethical grounds may distinctly affect the use of infertility treatments in compared countries \[[@B17]\].

The core of our paper is not a mere cross-country comparison of ART utilization but does focus on searching for a relationship between the increased use of ART and fertility trends. While the impact of childbearing postponement on the fertility rate and ART demand has been analysed and discussed \[[@B18],[@B10]-[@B21]\], the impact of ART increasing use on both the fertility rate and birth timing has not been studied comprehensively. Our research goal was to evaluate the demographic potential of ART increasing use in relation to childbearing postponement. Consequently ART higher use is expected in countries with a higher fertility rate and a delayed fertility pattern. Nevertheless findings are interpreted with caution as both the fertility

Caregiver burden, defined in this study as *'the extent to which caregivers perceive that caregiving has had an adverse effect on their emotional, social, financial, physical, and spiritual functioning \[[@pntd.0007487.ref025]\]',* was evident in the caregivers of those affected by podoconiosis and ADLA in Wayu Tuka *woreda*.

Consistently, caregivers reported the significant financial impact of acute attacks on covering healthcare costs and the pressure these recurrent costs placed on family finances for other necessities such as clothes, food and children's education. The ability to earn a wage was not only restricted in those directly affected by podoconiosis and ADLA but also in caregivers, who remained at home to care for them. Furthermore, resources that caregivers were able to accumulate were being periodically drained to cover healthcare costs, preventing caregivers, and podoconiosis-affected families, from being able to progress, or keep up with, others in their community. The emotional worry caregivers reported related directly to the financial pressure they were placed under, as well as concern for their affected relative. These findings are supported by those of Perera et al (2007) in participants with lymphatic filariasis (LF) in Sri Lanka \[[@pntd.0007487.ref035]\]. Participants reported the devastating impact of LF on household income--this comprised of loss of earnings through their inability to work, loss of earnings of family members who stayed at home to care for them or carry out other household tasks and the burden of recurrent medication costs \[[@pntd.0007487.ref035]\]. Children, as in our study, were held back from school to help with work. The notion of being unable to progress was also noted; '*for some participants*, *the presence of a member with LF had been a hindrance to family progress*, *rather than a cause of poverty*, *holding the family finances back when they could have achieved an improved standard of living*' \[[@pntd.0007487.ref035]\].

It was apparent from our study that, despite clear recognition of when healthcare was required and trust in the local clinic, participants simply could not afford to pay the required costs for medicines needed during an episode of ADLA. Potentially compounding this was the very high incidence of attacks reported by caregivers. Occurring as frequently as every 2--3 days, with an average of 6 attacks per month (see [supporting information](#sec028){ref-type="sec"}),

To rule out the possibility that our observations were gender-specific, we compared leukocyte recruitment and inflammatory mediator production in the pouches of male WT and CB~2~^−/−^ mice at 6 h upon Zymosan administration. Similar to our data with female animals, neutrophils constituted the dominant leukocyte population at 6 h ([Supplemental Fig. S2*A*, *C*](#SM1){ref-type="supplementary-material"}) and, together with total CD45^+^ cells, were significantly greater in number (*P* \< 0.05) in the pouches of CB~2~^−/−^ male mice ([Supplemental Fig. S2*E*, *F*](#SM1){ref-type="supplementary-material"}).

Lastly, Ly-6C^lo^ and Ly-6C^hi^ monocytes were also present in the pouches of male mice ([Supplemental Fig. S2*B*, *D*](#SM1){ref-type="supplementary-material"}), but we did not detect any differences in their absolute numbers between the genotypes at 6 h ([Supplemental Fig. S2*G*, *H*](#SM1){ref-type="supplementary-material"}).

Details of the load, temperature sensors and the serpentine structure of the microfluidic channel are shown in [Figure 4b](#f4-sensors-14-20245){ref-type="fig"}. Glass is used as a substrate to carry the load and sensors. It is chosen due to its very low thermal conductivity, which is 100-times smaller than that of silicon. Lower thermal conductivity is required to limit unwanted heat loss through the substrate to the surroundings. Glass also has a much better electromagnetic response than silicon, as the high frequency performance of the load depends very much on the dielectric strength of the substrate. The ideal load is required to be a thin film resistor with uniform material properties, low temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR), long-term stability and low nonlinear effects. For good RF performance with lower reflected power, the resistance needs to be accurate and uniform. Tantalum nitride (TaN) is chosen as the material for the load, due to its low TCR. For ease of prototype fabrication, a coplanar wave-guide (CPWG) structure is constructed, using TaN for the load and Al for the ground plane, to direct the RF power to the load.

Aluminum-resistive temperature detectors (RTDs) are used as temperature sensors. RTDs are very suitable for a microfluidic design, as they can be made to have much better contact with the fluid, due to their simple planar structure. Aluminum is chosen due to its low cost, its linearity and relatively high TCR \[[@b19-sensors-14-20245]\]. Since it is necessary to measure small changes in resistance, Wheatstone bridges are used \[[@b20-sensors-14-20245]\]. An MP6 micro-pump is used to pump the fluid. Although deionized water could be used as the fluid, it was decided to use HFE-7500. Compared to deionized water, HFE-7500 has a higher viscosity and less reaction with aluminum, which results in less corrosion and fewer pattern defects. From the experiment results, we see that when deionized water is used, after a few minutes of operation, the metal of the temperature sensor begins to disappear and its electrical resistance increases dramatically (see [Figure 5](#f5-sensors-14-20245){ref-type="fig"}). On the other hand, when HFE-7500 is used, we see no corrosion when in contact with the sensor, and the patterns remain und

Asthma is the least common cause of nontraumatic death in college football players, with only 1 fatality occurring since 2000.^[@bibr4-1941738118805694]^ The lone case was a Northwestern University football player with a known diagnosis of chronic asthma who died in 2002 while conditioning.

In a review of high school and college football fatalities between 1990 and 2010, Boden et al^[@bibr2-1941738118805694]^ found 164 indirect (or nontraumatic) deaths compared with 79 due to trauma. The fatality risk for college players was 2.8 times greater, possibly reflecting the increase in the intensity of the game from high school to college. Again, most of the nontraumatic events did not occur during games, suggesting that the intensity of preseason practices and conditioning sessions was actually greater than that of games.

The excessive nature of some college football conditioning programs is further evidenced by a report from the University of Iowa in 2013.^[@bibr12-1941738118805694]^ The problematic session included sled pushing and weight-lifting tasks. Players performed 100 back squats at 50% of the 1-repetition maximum. This workout resulted in 13 player hospitalizations for exertional rhabdomyolysis,^[@bibr12-1941738118805694]^ which is characterized by exercise-induced muscle fiber breakdown with release of muscle components into the bloodstream. This condition can lead to renal failure and death; fortunately, none of the Iowa football players became fatalities.

With the recent documented examples of excessive training routines, it is becoming more and more clear that the current medical safeguards for the college football athlete are inadequate. With 28 nontraumatic deaths since 2000 occurring during conditioning and training, that part of the NCAA football program demands investigation. With the most recent death of Jordan McNair, a 19-year-old Maryland football player who succumbed after an off-season workout in August 2018, we are again reminded how dangerous the intense preparation can be.^[@bibr3-1941738118805694]^ Most startling is that these deaths have occurred in preparation for the game of football and not during the games themselves. This fact suggests that the intensity of the preparation is tougher than it needs to be.

In 2010, Head Football Coach Terry Bowden lamented,"There is no reasonable expectation of death while playing football. So why are lives being lost preparing for the game? Maybe these tragic deaths are not inevitable? Maybe it's time to start asking ourselves different

Comment
=======

The title compound was prepared as part of our ongoing studies of hydrogen-bonding interactions in the crystal structures of protonated amines (Bouacida, 2008; Bouacida *et al.*, 2009).

In the title compound (Fig. 1), all bond distances and angles are within the ranges of accepted values (CSD, Allen, 2002). The amino N atom is protonated as in the other amines and imines (Bouacida *et al.*, 2005*a*,b,c; Rademeyer, 2004*a*,b). The Sn^IV^ atom is six-coordinated with six Cl atoms, located on an inversion center, forming a slightly distorted octahedral geometry. The crystal structure can be described as alternating layers of \[SnCl~6~\]

The presence of neutralising anti-MOC31PE antibodies in serum was examined in a MOC31PE-induced cytotoxicity assay (MTS assay) ([Figure 3](#fig3){ref-type="fig"} and [Supplementary Figure 1a and b](#sup1){ref-type="supplementary-material"}). In the presence of anti-MOC31PE antibodies in the serum, the cytotoxic effect of MOC31PE would be partly or fully neutralised.

In MOC31PE alone study, 2 weeks after the first cycle with MOC31PE treatment, 9 of the 29 patients (31%) had developed neutralising anti-MOC31PE antibodies, compared with only 19% (4 of 21 patients) in MOC31PE+CsA, most likely reflecting the immunosuppressive function of CsA ([Figure 3](#fig3){ref-type="fig"}). However, the statistical difference was not significant. This effect was even more pronounced 2 weeks after the second cycle, where 77% (24 of 31) of the patients treated with MOC31PE alone had neutralising antibodies, compared with only 29% (6 of 21) of the patients receiving MOC31PE and CsA, *P*\<0.05. Moreover, at 6 weeks after treatment start (third cycle of MOC31PE), almost all of the patients in MOC31PE alone had developed antibodies (27 of 28) whereas the immunosuppressive effect of CsA was still clear, as only 50% (10 of 20) of these patients had antibodies, *P*\<0.05. With an ELISA, we measured the levels of anti-MOC31PE antibodies (data not shown). The ELISA data showed an overall accordance to the MTS data. Fetal calf serum and serum from healthy volunteers had no effect on MOC31PE-induced cytotoxicity in MA11 cells (data not shown).

Presence of micrometastatic cancer cells in BM
----------------------------------------------

Bone marrow samples, four out of six patients treated with 4 *μ*g kg^−1^ of MOC31PE and three out of five patients treated with 5 *μ*g kg^−1^, were taken in the MOC31PE+CsA study at baseline and 2 weeks post treatment ([Figure 4](#fig4){ref-type="fig"}). No obvious cytotoxic effect of MOC31PE on the presence of micrometastatic cells in BM was detected in patients treated with 4 *μ

In the hemostatic study, Flashclot was used as the control. All 18 animals completed the study with no exclusions. No significant differences existed among groups for weights, pre-injury MAP, pre-injury blood loss, or the weights of transected livers. During the procedure, no hemodynamic changes were detected that could confound bleeding time (data not shown), and no any rabbit died.

Overall, as shown in [Table 1](#tab1){ref-type="table"}, no obvious diversity in the bleeding time was observed when the wounds were treated with Flashclot or microparticles (*P* \> 0.05). However, the bleeding time of the tranexamic acid-loaded microparticle group was significantly shorter than that of the Flashclot group (*P* \< 0.01) and the microparticle group (*P* \< 0.05). No clear difference in the total blood loss was observed between the three groups.

During the hemostatic procedure, as we treated the wound with Flashclot and applied a pressure on it, the Flashclot blended with the blood was so hot that we had to cover the Flashclot with several layers of gauzes, but we did not feel the heat when the wound was treated with microparticles. The histology evaluation is shown in [Figure 9](#fig9){ref-type="fig"}. In FlashclotTM group, coagulative necrosis in superficial layer contacted with FlashclotTM, remarkable shrinkage and hepatic sinuses dilation in hepatic tissue were observed ([Figure 9(b)](#fig9){ref-type="fig"}).

4. Discussion {#sec4}
=============

In order to achieve satisfactory hemostatic efficiency, the selection of proper components for preparation of the powdery hemostatic agent is critical. In this study, we chose sodium alginate and chitosan as base materials, not only because they have good properties, such as biocompatibility and biodegradation, but also because they both have certain hemostatic abilities with different hemostatic mechanisms. Moreover, chitosan is a natural cationic polysaccharide polymer; the cationic nature and high charge density of chitosan in solution allows it to form stable ionic complexes with multivalent water-soluble anionic polymers under mild physiological conditions \[[@B22], [@B26]\]. Alginate is an anionic polysaccharide polymer that can form complexes with polycations such as calcium, chitosan, and polylysine \[[@B27], [@B28]\].

Although each was non-significant, we list the ten SNPs with the lowest *p* values for the associations with observed and reported fertility in [Supplementary Tables 5 and 6](#SD1){ref-type="supplementary-material"}. SNPs in many different genes appeared in these lists. Among them was a neutrally selected control SNP in the list for the association with observed fertility in middle-aged women. None of the SNPs appeared in both lists.

DISCUSSION {#s3}
==========

The aim of this study was to identify the genetic variants that determine life history through variation in survival and fertility in a traditional rural African population that lives in an adverse environment without a western lifestyle. We conducted a large-scale candidate gene study using a high density of SNPs. We found no statistically significant association of any genetic variant with either survival or fertility.

Studies on the genetic determinants of variation in human survival and fertility in adverse environments have never been executed with numbers of individuals and SNPs comparable to this study. Due to a lack of previous genetic studies in this region, we could not rely on standard genome-wide association analyses given the higher degree of population stratification and the lesser degree of linkage disequilibrium in African populations \[[@R30]\]. Instead, we used a custom-made array for geno-typing a high density of SNPs in the genes of interest. A relatively large proportion of SNPs failed genotyping or had an insufficient minor allele frequency. The exceptional circumstances that are inherent to adverse environments -- such as an inadequate infrastructure, a missing civil registry, and language and culture barriers -- compromised the study\'s execution. The proportion

Background
==========

Up-conversion materials have the ability to convert lower energy near-infrared radiations into higher energy visible radiations. These materials have gained considerable attention because of their use in a wide range of important applications, from solid compact laser devices operating in the visible region and infrared quantum counter detectors to three-dimensional displays, temperature sensors, solar cells, anti-counterfeiting, and biological fluorescence labels and probes \[[@B1]-[@B6]\]. Further efforts in development of methods for preparation of up-conversion (UC) materials are therefore justified with aims of enhancing their UC efficiency and reducing production costs. In addition, methods for UC nanoparticle (UCNP) synthesis are of particular interest for use in two-photon bio-imaging, sensitive luminescent bio-labels, and GaAs-coated highly efficient light-emitting diodes \[[@B7]\].

Lanthanide-based UC materials and UCNPs are of special interest due to unique spectroscopic properties of rare-earth ions like sharp intra-4*f* electronic transitions and existence of abundant, long-living electronic excited states at various energies that facilitate electron promotion to high-energy states \[[@B8]\]. In principal, lanthanide-based UC materials and UCNPs consist of three components: a host matrix, a sensitizer, and an activator dopant. The choice of the host lattice determines the distance between the dopant ions, their relative spatial position, their coordination numbers, and the type of anions surrounding the dopant. The properties of the host lattice and its interaction with the dopant ions therefore have a strong influence on the UC process \[[@B9]\]. It has been shown that UC emission efficiency depends strongly on host phonon energy, where in low-phonon-energy hosts, multi-phonon relaxation processes are depressed and efficiency-enhanced \[[@B10]\]. Because of their excellent chemical stability, broad transparency range, and good thermal conductivity, rare-earth sesquioxides are well-suited host materials \[[@B11]\]. Their phonon energy (*ca.* 560 cm^−1^) is higher compared to the most UC-efficient fluoride materials (*ca.* 350 cm^−1^), but lower compared to other host types (phosphates, vanadates, molybdates, titanates, zirconates, silicates, etc.). In addition, easy doping can be achieved with RE ions because of similarity in ionic radius and charge. For sensitizer dopant, Yb^3+^ is the most common choice for excitation around 980 nm

All patients' case records and imaging findings were retrospectively reviewed. Observation indices included demographic information, clinical manifestations, radiologic findings, laboratory examination findings, diagnostic procedures, therapeutic interventions, and outcomes. Patients with TA with pulmonary artery involvement were further divided into a PH group and non-PH group for comparison. The prognostic information was collected by telephone follow-up.

Statistical analysis {#Sec6}
--------------------

Data were analyzed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and are expressed as median (range). The measurement data were analyzed by analysis of variance or the Mann--Whitney U test to compare within- or between-group differences. The enumeration data were analyzed by the χ^2^ test. Survival rate analysis was performed using Kaplan--Meier and Cox regression methods. A *P* value of \<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

General information {#Sec8}
-------------------

From January 1986 to December 2015, a total of 815 patients with TA were hospitalized in PUMCH, among whom 51 (6.26%) were found to have PA (Fig. [1](#Fig1){ref-type="fig"}). According to their date of diagnosis, the patients were divided into six groups at 5-year intervals. The number of patients with TA increased over time (*n* = 37, 58, 54, 143, 209, and 314). In addition, the proportion of patients with PA among those with TA also showed an upward trend with time (0.0, 0.0, 1.9, 2.1, 7.2, and 10.2%) (Fig. [2](#Fig2){ref-type="fig"}). Fig. 1Diagnostic flow chart of patients who had Takayasu's arteritis with pulmonary artery involvement Fig. 2Number of patients with Takayasu's arteritis (TA) and proportion of patients with pulmonary arteritis (PA) among those with TA gradually increased over 30 years

The 51 patients comprised 39 females and 12 males at a male:female ratio of 1.0:3.2; the median age of the patients was 33 (14--67) years. Among the 51 patients with PA, 30 (58.8%) were diagnosed with presumptive PH \[median estimated PASP, 84.5 (52--139) mmHg; median peak TRV, 4.25 (3.5--5.

The goal of this study was to examine the associations of grand-maternal smoking during pregnancy with birth weight and risk of obesity in their grandchildren. To achieve this goal, we constructed a three-generation cohort by linking data from three cohorts of related individuals: the Nurses' Mothers Cohort Study (NMCS), the ongoing Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II) and the ongoing Growing Up Today Study 2 (GUTS2). The NMCS is comprised of mothers of women participating in NHSII and GUTS2 is comprised of offspring of women in NHS II, thus allowing us to study smoking effects across three generations.

Methods {#sec006}
=======

Study population {#sec007}
----------------

NHS-II was established in 1989 when 116,430 female nurses (aged 25--42 years) completed a questionnaire about their lifestyle and medical history. Follow-up questionnaires are sent biennially to collect updated information. In 2001, 39,904 mothers of NHS-II participants completed a questionnaire regarding their pregnancy with their NHS-II participant daughter and additional information regarding their daughter's infancy (Nurses' Mothers Cohort Study). The Growing Up Today Study 2 (GUTS2) began in 2004 when 10,907 children (6,002 girls; 4,905 boys) age 9--14 years of women participating in NHS-II completed a baseline questionnaire regarding health and growth indicators. Follow-up questionnaires have been sent biennially to update information. Additional information on GUTS2 participants' perinatal and early life exposures were collected in 2009 from 9,096 NHS-II participants with children enrolled in GUTS2. After excluding 1,652 individuals with missing information on maternal smoking status during pregnancy, we had data from 38,252 mother-offspring dyads between NMCS (F1) and the NHS-II (F2) cohorts, 8,606 mother-offspring dyads between the NHS-II (F2) and the GUTS2 (F3) cohorts, and 6,583 grandmother-mother-offspring triads (F1, F2, F3). The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Brigham and Women's Hospital.

Three, six and nine weeks after surgery, the rabbits were killed. Femur-tendon graft-tibia complexes were harvested with 60 mm of femur and 60 mm of tibia. Soft tissues adjacent to the tendon graft were clearly removed. Gross observation was performed regarding articular degeneration and tendon graft incorporation on the articular surface.

Biomechanical tests
-------------------

For the biomechanical properties of the femur-tendon graft-tibia complexes, pull-out tests were conducted at zero, three, six and nine weeks following surgery. The left leg of the rabbit model was performed ACL reconstruction surgery immediately following euthanasia and was used as the 0 week group in the biomechanical tests. Two bone ends of the femur-tendon graft-tibia complex were fixed in a Zwick materials testing machine (Z020, Zwick/Roell, Germany) using inserted pins ([Fig. 2](#f2){ref-type="fig"}). The axial side of the complex was parallel to the direction of the applied loads with a preloading of 1 N. The load displacement rate was set at 0.5 mm/min. The failure modes of the tendon graft, the ultimate load to failure (N) and the related stiffness (N/mm) at each time point were recorded according to reference[@b44].

Micro-computed tomography (microCT) evaluation
----------------------------------------------

MicroCT scanning of the femur-tendon graft-tibia complexes was conducted at three, six and nine weeks post-surgery. The MicroCT device (Laboratory Micro-CT Scanner eXplore RS 80, GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) was set as follows: 80 kV and 450 μA in the X-ray tube, a scan resolution of 45 μm and an exposure time of 400 ms. The volume of the P Mg screw was analyzed using Micro View 2.2 Advanced Bone Analysis Application software (GE Health Systems, Waukesha, WI, USA). The percentage volume change (Δv) was calculated as the difference between the initial volume (v0) and the final volume (v1):

Three samples were scanned for each type of interference screw, with an average of three times per sample.

Histological analysis
---------------------

Following fixation in 4% neutral buffered formalin for 48 hours, the femur-tendon graft-tibia complex fixed by an HP

Conclusion
==========

In this prospective study, we found the following: 1) while in use, oral intake of VPA was suggestive of a short-term benefit to patients with RP and 2) regardless of the genotype, there were no systemic drug-related adverse events. It is necessary to examine the effect of a longer VPA supplementation in a controlled study design.

Once the proband was diagnosed, her family members were invited to participate in the study and were screened for PDB. Two siblings (II6 and II11) of this proband were diagnosed with PDB. Patient II6 was 54 years of age when she was diagnosed. DR examination showed that her skull, humeri, vertebrae, pelvis and femurs were affected and that her serum ALP (3337 IU l^−1^) at the time of diagnosis was elevated. This patient\'s main clinical symptoms were low back pain, cervical and limb weakness, and slight spinal deformity. The patient claimed that cervical and limb weakness had appeared \~2 years prior to diagnosis. No other complications were found. Patient II11 was 45 years of age when he was diagnosed. DR examination showed that his skull, vertebrae and pelvis were affected and that his serum ALP (1851 IU l^−1^) at the time of diagnosis was elevated. However, sclerosis and bone expansion in this patient were mild compared with those in the other two patients. At the beginning of the study, this patient reported no significant symptoms.

The patients and some of the patients\' family members were again invited for further examination and treatment \~2 years ago. DR examination confirmed that there were no new affected bones in the patients. However, the spinal deformity of patient II6 had become more severe. A body height reduction of \~9 cm was noted in patient II11, who complained of cervical weakness. Magnetic resonance examination showed that the first, second and third lumbar vertebrae of this patient were severely compressed and presented typical double-sided depressed deformities (not shown). The serum ALP levels of these patients demonstrated progressive ALP elevation ([Table 1](#tbl1){ref-type="table"}). Intravenous infusion of zoledronic acid (Aclasta, Novartis Pharma Schweiz AG, Switzerland) at 5 mg per year was used for each patient. After 2 years of treatment, the symptoms of patients II3 and II11, including cervical and limb weakness, and body height reduction, were significantly remitted; the serum ALP levels of these two patients also significantly decreased ([Table 1](#tbl1){ref-type="table"}), and the calcium and phosphorus homeostasis of the patients was normal. Patient II6 did not return for examination. Five offspring of the patients were also examined, and none of them showed pagetic changes. Detailed information on the patients and their offspring, and the results of the

Simulation data sets for each TEM variant were combined and clustered into a single shared state-space. Each data set consisted of 4 μs FAST-RMSD and 2.5 μs conventional simulations. With 5 sequences, this gives a total of 32.5 μs of total simulation. The shared state-space was defined using all heavy atoms on residues within 1.0 Å of position 182 in the crystallographic structure of TEM β-lactamase (PDB ID: 1JWP). The side chain atoms of position 182 were not included, since they vary between sequences. These atomic coordinates were then clustered with a *k*-centers algorithm based on RMSD between conformations until every cluster center had a radius less than 1.0 Å. Then, 10 sweeps of a *k*-medoids update step was used to center the clusters on the densest regions of conformational space. Following clustering, the cluster assignments were split and a unique MSM was constructed for each TEM sequence with a lagtime of 2 ns. To obey microscopic reversibility, transition count matrices were symmetrized. Representative cluster centers were saved for each state in each sequence for analysis.

Geometric analysis of representative cluster centers was performed using MDTraj:^[@ref36]^ in particular, RMSDs, solvent-accessible surface areas, and atomic distances. Ensemble average values within MSMs were calculated as the expectation value for a particular observable. I.e., the expectation of observable *Z* is calculated aswhere *p*(*z*~*i*~) is the population of state *i* and *z*~*i*~ is the value of state *i*. All cumulative distribution functions were generated with population-weighted statistics of representative conformations from each state in the MSMs we built from our FAST simulation data sets. Each point in one of these cumulative distribution functions is calculated aswhere *p*(*z*~*i*~) is the population of state *i*.

Protein Expression and Purification {#sec4.4}
-----------------------------------

TEM-1 was subcloned using *Nde*I and *Xho*I restriction sites into the multiple cloning site of a pET24 vector (Life Technologies), and its native export signal sequence was replaced by the OmpA signal sequence to maximize export efficiency. Site-specific variants were constructed via site-directed mutagenesis and verified by DNA sequencing. Plasmids were then transformed into BL21(DE3) Gold cells (Agilent Technologies) for expression under T7

Two prominent and comprehensive introductions to Bayesian epistemology say almost nothing about justification ([@R30]; [@R8]).

In axiomatic contexts, a definition conservatively extends a theory T in a language L to $\acute{T}$ in an extended language Ĺ if for every sentence ϕ of L, T proves ϕ iff $\acute{T}$ proves ϕ. Put informally, conservative definitions do not facilitate proofs of anything new (other than derivative consequences of extending the language). Acquiring new knowledge in this way is precisely the point of explication.

No divergence need occur if the contours of epistemic concepts are extraordinarily sharp, such that increasing precision (through axiomatization or otherwise) more accurately reflects their true structure. On this view the rationale for increasing precision in epistemology would mirror methodology in physics and most other sciences: precision simply facilitates more accurate description, in this case of conceptual content rather than physical properties and processes. But this is highly implausible. How competent natural language speakers actually understand and employ terms representing epistemic concepts---and what cognitive psychology generally reveals about the fluid nature of concepts ([@R41])---shows this ambitiously precise account of our epistemic conceptual apparatus is mistaken. Of course, these results are not conclusive if epistemic concepts are abstract objects that serve as constituents of propositions ([@R50]), *and* the realm of such conceptual abstracts is precisely structured. We believe this view of concepts (and conceptual structure) is untenable, but cannot address this complex issue here.

Formal epistemology can also address descriptive issues about human cognition (e.g. [@R56]). Analyses with this focus share goals similar to psychology and Carnap's rationale for explication of empirical concepts applies.

[@R12], 7) simply gauged fruitfulness in terms of the production of well-confirmed generalizations, but his explications (and the scientific methodology they reflect) demonstrate that well-confirmed generalizations contribute differentially, not equally, to fruitfulness. Explications that facilitate numerous well-confirmed, but nevertheless trivial generalizations fare poorly on fruitfulness. Generalizations with wider scope contribute more, as do generalizations that better catalyze discovery of further generalizations. Beyond these plausible general principles, Carnap's reticence about fruitfulness likely reflects a pragmatic perspective: fruitfulness depends on the particular purposes for which explication is employed. Carnap's naturalism and scientific orientation tempers this pragmatism (see [@R54]), but a pragmatic

RII interaction assays
----------------------

RII overlays were performed using murine \[^32^P\]RIIα as previously described ([@bib4]). For yeast two-hybrid analysis, the cDNA encoding RIIα 1--45 was subcloned into the Gal4 activation domain containing yeast expression vector pACT2. This gene encodes an NH~2~-terminal Gal4 activation domain fused to RIIα 1--45. Each pLexA-Rab32, -Rab32L188P, -Rab5, -Rab6, or -Rab7 was cotransformed with the pACT2-RIIα 1--45 into the yeast strain L40 as described above.

Autospot peptide array
----------------------

Peptide arrays were synthesized on cellulose paper using an Auto-Spot robot ASP222 (ABiMED) as previously described ([@bib13]). After synthesis, the NH~2~ termini were acetylated with 2% acetic acid anhydride in DMF. The peptides were then deprotected by a 1-h treatment with DCM--TFA, 1:1, containing 3% triisopropylsilane and 2% water.

Immunoprecipitations and PKA activity assay
-------------------------------------------

Cells 50--80% confluent were transfected using Lipofectamine Plus reagents (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\'s instruction. 5 μg of plasmid DNA (Flag--Rab32 or Flag--Rab32L188P) was used to transfect HEK-293 cells in 10-cm dishes. Transfections were performed for 24 h, followed by lysis in IP buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100). Recombinant proteins were immunoprecipitated using Sepharose-conjugated antiFlag monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). PKA kinase assays were performed as previously described ([@bib8]).

Northern blot
-------------

A Northern blot containing immobilized samples of mRNA from several human tissues (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) was assayed using a ^32^P-radiolabeled 113-bp probe corresponding to the COOH-terminal hypervariable domain of Rab32. Human RNA dot blot analysis was performed according to the manufacturer\'s instructions (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.).

Description
===========

The Transgenic RNAi Project (TRiP) has generated more than 12,000 transgenic RNAi fly stocks that have been distributed to the community via the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (Ni et al. 2007; Ni et al. 2011; Perkins et al. 2015). These stocks express long double-stranded RNA hairpins (dsRNAs) or short RNA hairpins (shRNAs) under GAL4/UAS control (Brand and Perrimon 1993), and provide powerful tools for targeted genetic screens. Unexpectedly, as part of a genetic screen examining retinal degeneration in flies, we identified a defect in eye development associated with many of the TRiP stocks. *Drosophila* have a compound eye composed of repeating units, termed ommatidia, that each contain eight photoreceptor cells (R cells 1 -- 8) (Ready, Hansen and Benzer 1976). The light-sensing organelle, the rhabdomere, in seven of these photoreceptors can be directly visualized in wild-type flies using light microscopy either by optical neutralization or by examining the deep pseudopupil; R7/R8 are stacked on top of each other so only one is visible in a given vertical plane (Franceschini and Kirschfeld 1971).Whereas seven rhabdomeres could be counted per ommatidium in wild-type flies (Fig. 1A), a subset of the TRiP lines tested show characteristic loss of a single rhabdomere (Fig. 1A, Fig. 1B). This single photoreceptor loss phenotype is reminiscent of *sevenless* *(sev)* mutants; *sev* (FBgn0003366) encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase essential for development of R7; thus, loss of function *sev* mutations result in ommatidia that lack R7 (Harris et al. 1976; Simon, Bowtell and Rubin 1989). Preliminary observations suggested that the *sev* phenotype was X-linked and observed only in TRiP stocks containing a *scute (sc)* allele of unknown origin denoted *sc^\*^.* Whole genome sequencing data for one of the TRiP stocks with the X chromosome containing this *sc* allele (*y^1^ sc^\*^ v^1^)* revealed the presence of an A\>T mutation at position X:1107648 in *sev*, which would result in a premature stop codon at K665X. We tested several of the TRiP stocks that showed the *sev*

CASE DESCRIPTION
================

A 32-year-old woman with hereditary optic atrophy due to mutation of the OPA1 gene was admitted to hospital for dyspnoea. The patient was in an in vitro fertilization program. She had been treated with FSHr and GnRH for ovarian stimulation with subsequent administration of HCGr and implantation of two embryos free of the OPA1 mutation, 5 days before admission. Physical examination revealed grade 2 ascites and bilateral lower limb oedema. Blood analysis showed haemoglobin of 16.6 g/dl, sodium 133 mmol/l, albumin 3.3 g/l and βHCG 200 mU/ml, with preserved renal and hepatic function. Transvaginal ultrasonography demonstrated enlarged ovaries with free fluid in the pelvis and two gestational sacs. Following the diagnosis of OHSS, fluid restriction and thromboembolic prophylaxis were started. On the sixth day after admission, abdominal distension and dyspnoea increased, together with hypotension and signs of haemoconcentration. Ultrasonography demonstrated severe pleural effusion and ascites. Electrocardiogram and echocardiogram findings were within the normal range. Serum albumin and intravenous furosemide were added, alongside repeated paracentesis and thoracentesis. Given the persistence of dyspnoea with refractory pleural effusion, a thoracic drainage tube was placed, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit.

In the following days symptoms persisted and a therapeutic abortion was suggested. Given the similarities between OHSS and idiopathic systemic capillary leak syndrome (SCLS), we offered the patient compassionate treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) which has previously proven useful in SCLS. After administration of IVIG (0.5 g/kg/day for 3 consecutive days), the patient showed rapid improvement, and we were able to suspend intravenous furosemide and serum albumin and to remove the thoracic drainage tube. The patient was discharged, and pregnancy has continued normally to date.

DISCUSSION
==========

OHSS is the most severe complication associated with assisted reproductive treatments. Its pathophysiology involves increased capillary permeability that leads to a wide variety of signs and symptoms such as hypotension, ascites and pleural effusion. Although it is generally self-limiting, 5% of patients will develop life-threatening complications^\[[@b1-1253-1-9302-1-10-20190927]\]^. There is no specific treatment, and management is based on the control of fluid balance, thrombo

Data accessibility and legend
-----------------------------

The complete datasets used in the aGFP database are described in the Legend available from the homepage and it is possible to trace the origin of all datasets. Moreover, data can be downloaded for individual and selected gene sets as a TAB-delimited text. This enables the direct import of downloaded data into spreadsheet editors such as Excel and database software such as Access and FileMaker. This text file contains a list of developmental and morphological stages, normalized expression data for the selected normalization algorithm and data source.

Conclusion
==========

arabidopsisGFP is a microarray expression database of wild type *Arabidopsis thaliana*plants grown under physiological conditions. It gathers data from experiments using Affymetrix ATH1 whole genome arrays with two or more biological replicates. From the outset, it has been created as intuitive user-oriented web-tool employing a \"general-to-specific\" concept enabling the user to obtain certain amount of information at every step with progressive specification and refinement. The aGFP database contains several gene selection and grouping tools including pre-defined gene families. It also provides the user with different gene expression visualization options including a unique \"virtual plant\" graphic display. Easy switching of visualization options gives the user the possibility to rapidly select the most suitable form of data presentation. A novel advantage of the aGFP database is the provision of alternative normalization treatments of microarray data using statistical (MAS5.0) and empirical algorithms (MAS4.0). Together with the facile switch between these detection algorithms it provides the opportunity to instantly assess the reliability of gene expression data. Arabidopsis Gene Family Profiler represents a versatile tool for facile visualization of transcriptomic data that can be exploited in genome-led queries of gene and gene family functions and regulation.

Availability and requirements
=============================

The aGFP database is freely accessible and its concept offers the possibility to extract and visualize expression profiles of individual genes, gene sets, gene families or gene superfamilies from a broad spectrum of microarray experiments covering various *Arabidopsis*organs, tissues and developmental stages. For these purposes, an innovative graphic concept of the \"virtual plant\" was introduced representing a clear and simple visualization of gene expression profiles in a morphological and developmental context. The arabidopsisGFP database is accessible at <http://agfp.ueb.cas.cz/>.

Finally, our study is an example where weak vdW interactions need to be incorporated in the computational framework to correctly reproduce the experimentally observed phenomena. The fact that this is the case for a strongly bound chemisorbed adsorbate where vdW interactions represent only a small fraction of the adsorption energy is particularly noteworthy. In the PBE+vdW framework, intermolecular vdW interactions tip the balance towards condensation and restructuring, in agreement with the experimental observations. While the pure PBE functional may already include part of the non-local interactions in certain systems[@b43], it does not reproduce the trend for condensation as this transformation would be uphill in energy. In the acetate case, we compare various densities of the same adsorbed molecule and our detailed structure analysis ([Supplementary Fig. 7](#S1){ref-type="supplementary-material"} and [Supplementary Table 6](#S1){ref-type="supplementary-material"}) shows very little configurational variation among the supercells considered. Therefore, we expect even higher accuracy of the computational method in comparing supercell energies.

In conclusion, we show that a combination of strong adsorbate--substrate and weak inter-adsorbate interactions leads to the formation of dense acetate islands on Au(110). The associated Au restructuring from Au-(1 × 2) to Au-(1 × 1) where the missing-rows are filled provides the necessary increase in the adsorption site density to switch on the weak acetate--acetate interactions, already at low coverage of acetate on the surface. Using the state-of-the-art DFT calculations with vdW corrections, we demonstrate the critical role of vdW interactions in driving the surface Au displacement. Hence, the present study provides a mechanism of surface restructuring, which is facilitated by the non-covalent collective effects of surface adsorbates and is related to the thermodynamics of the system. These findings may have broad implications in the structural control of surface morphology and the self-assembly of surface adsorbates and stress the counterintuitive importance of vdW corrections in DFT simulations in the case of small chemisorbed adsorbates.

Sample cleaning
---------------

Two different Au(110) single crystals (Princeton Scientific) were mounted in two separate chambers dedicated to STM and temperature programmed reaction spectroscopy (TPRS). In both cases, samples were cleaned via cycles of sputtering and annealing at 800--900 K until a uniform Au(110)-(1 × 2) (

For its size, Shetland has a large public sector, and Shetland Islands Council and National Health Service (NHS) Shetland are the biggest employers. The provision of services across 15 inhabited islands presents unusual challenges and opportunities. Public sector staff work throughout the islands, for example, as teachers, doctors, community workers, nurses or ferry staff. A social worker, nurse, doctor, town planner or customs officer may find that they need to travel by ferry or light aircraft in the course of their work (Shetland.org, [@ref5]).

In 2014, under the new Public Bodies (Joint Working) (Scotland) Act 2014, Shetland Islands Council and the Board of NHS Shetland joined forces to form the Integrated Joint Board, which was intended to ensure seamless health and social care provision (Shetland.gov.uk, [@ref4]).

Shetland NHS Board provides healthcare for a population of around 23 000. Hospital and community services are provided from the Gilbert Bain Hospital and ten health centres. Visiting consultants from NHS Grampian provide out-patient clinics, as well as in-patient and day-case surgery, to supplement the service provided by the locally based consultants in medicine, surgery, anaesthetics and psychiatry (Shb.scot.nhs.uk, [@ref3]) There are no psychiatric in-patient beds in Shetland. Patients requiring admission are transferred to Aberdeen, and cared for on the medical ward in Shetland while awaiting transfer.

The mental health service {#sec6}
=========================

The mental health service is made up of the community mental health team (CMHT), the substance misuse and recovery service (SMRS), the talking therapy service (TTS) and the dementia assessment team. The CMHT and SMRS work closely together, especially with those patients with dual diagnoses. The two teams are staffed by community psychiatric nurses. In addition, the SMRS benefits from a general practitioner with a special interest in addictions and recovery workers. There is a small child and adolescent mental health service, which falls under the Children\'s Service directorate.

A full-time consultant psychiatrist and middle-grade (specialty doctor) psychiatrist provide clinical leadership for the CMHT and SMRS and share out-of-hours telephone on-call duties. They visit Royal Cornhill Hospital in Aberdeen monthly for academic activities, mentoring, and clinical and management interface, and

Friedman test revealed treatment effects of percentage correct detections (hits %) (*x*²(2)=6.68, *p*=0.04), subsequent treatment contrasts revealed that percentage of hits was higher during cocaine as compared with cannabis (*Z*=−2.04, *p*=0.04). Treatment contrasts comparing placebo with cocaine and placebo with cannabis were not significant. GLM repeated measures ANOVA revealed a main effect of treatment on tracking error (*F~2,24~*=4.08, *p=*0.03, *ƞ~p~^2^*=0.25), with subsequent treatment contrasts revealing a reduction in tracking error during cocaine as compared with cannabis (*p*=0.01). Again, treatment contrasts comparing placebo with cocaine and placebo with cannabis were not significant. Polynomial contrasts revealed a linear trend across all treatments (*F~1,12~*=10.29, *p=*0.01), indicating that tracking error was lowest after cocaine, intermediate after placebo and highest following cannabis treatment. Mean (±SE) performance scores for the divided attention task is shown in [Figure 2(b)](#fig2-0269881118783299){ref-type="fig"} and ([c](#fig2-0269881118783299){ref-type="fig"}).

Mean (±SE) arousal levels in every treatment condition are shown in [Figure 2(d)](#fig2-0269881118783299){ref-type="fig"}. GLM repeated measures ANOVA revealed a main effect of treatment on arousal levels (*F~2,28~*=9.71, *p*\<0.00, *ƞ~p~^2^*=0.41), subsequent treatment contrasts revealed higher arousal levels following cocaine administration as compared with placebo (*p*=0.01) and as compared with cannabis (*p\<*0.01). Treatment contrast between cannabis and placebo was not significant. Polynomial contrasts revealed a linear trend across all treatments (*F~1,14~*=13.84, *p*\<0.01), indicating that arousal levels were highest after cocaine, intermediate after placebo and lowest following cannabis treatment.

An experiment with a L/L biphasic system using triethylamine/benzene (no water) was carried and the result was the same: a grey film was formed at the interface characterized as graphene (Fig. S11[†](#fn1){ref-type="fn"}), confirming that any strong Lewis base (and not only water) can be used, corroborating the mechanism proposed in [Fig. 5](#fig5){ref-type="fig"}. Another key analysis was to evaluate the organic phase remaining after the reaction by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The chromatograms obtained from the organic phase of the samples GR-BZ and GR-HX are shown in Fig. S12,[†](#fn1){ref-type="fn"} along with the solvents (benzene and *n*-hexane). One important peak could be identified in the chromatogram of GR-BZ and GR-HX at a retention time of 17.7 min with a molecular ion of *m*/*z* = 154. The fragmentation pattern of this peak (shown in ESI, Fig. S13[†](#fn1){ref-type="fn"}) strongly agrees with the structure of biphenyl,[@cit55] a key species in the proposed mechanism. Other aromatic polynuclear species were not observed due to their known difficult detection by GC-MS ionization. Interestingly enough, for GR-HX the same peak attributed to biphenyl was detected at 16.3 min (Fig. S14 and S15[†](#fn1){ref-type="fn"}). The difference in retention time is due to the column change but its characteristic fragmentation pattern was also observed, confirming the proposed oxidative cyclization. In order to further confirm that biphenyl is formed in the synthesis using *n*-hexane and not only due to some residue/impurity of benzene, the organic phase was distilled and reused in a consecutive reaction. The chromatograms for all these steps were obtained (Fig. S14[†](#fn1){ref-type="fn"}) and evidence that upon distillation of the residual *n*-hexane in the synthesis, the signal due to biphenyl disappears, as expected. This distilled residual *n*-hexane is then used in another synthesis of GR-HX and the peak of biphenyl appears again, indicating that biphenyl is indeed formed during the reaction. Another interesting analysis was carried out with the GR-HX sample by electrospray ionization quadrupole

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques used to diagnose malaria infections include single-step, nested, multiplex and quantitative, conventional or real-time PCR formats. Other NAATs do not require thermal cyclers, the most common being loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification. The sensitivity of LAMP method is reported to approach that of nested PCR \[[@CR19]\] and unlike PCR, samples for LAMP do not require extensive preparation \[[@CR20]\].

The main objective of our study was to assess the diagnostic performance of the illumigene Malaria DNA Amplification assay^®^ (Meridian Bioscience, Inc., Cincinnati OH, USA), compared to microscopy, RDT and real-time PCR for *Plasmodium* spp. detection.

Methods {#Sec2}
=======

Study design {#Sec3}
------------

In this study, the diagnostic performance of the illumigene assay was assessed. In the retrospective part of the study, the assay was assessed against a selection of stored samples (n = 103) obtained from international travellers, collected from June 2015 to June 2016 and external quality controls (EQC) (n = 12). The malaria RDT, microscopic evaluation and real-time PCR \[[@CR1]\] were carried out at the reference laboratory of the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM) Antwerp, Belgium. The illumigene assay was performed retrospectively at the clinical laboratory of the Ghent University Hospital (GUH).

Furthermore, the illumigene assay was prospectively assessed between July 2016 and September 2016 on 30 samples obtained from patients suspected to have malaria infection at the clinical laboratory of the Ghent University Hospital (GUH). The malaria RDT, microscopic evaluation and illumigene assay were completed at the GUH. Thereafter, all positive and discordant samples were sent to ITM for species identification and determination of parasite density. This study complied with the standards for the reporting of diagnostic accuracy studies (STARD).

Clinical samples (retrospective and prospective) {#Sec4}
------------------------------------------------

A panel of stored EDTA-anticoagulated venous whole blood diagnostic samples (n = 103) and EQC samples (n = 12) was analysed. Blood samples were obtained from returned travellers who presented at the outpatient clinic of the ITM or were submitted by diagnostic laboratories for malaria confirmation to the Central Laboratory of Clinical Biology of ITM (the Belgian reference laboratory for *

The size and size distribution of the micelles were determined by a dynamic light scattering (DLS) spectrometer (Zetasizer Nano ZS; Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK) at 25°C. Each sample was measured three times to attain the average size. The morphology of NPs was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

Synthesis of star-shaped biodegradable 4sPLMBz random polymer
-------------------------------------------------------------

In brief, prescribed amounts of pentaerythritol benzyl (0.03 g, 0.27 mmol), [l]{.smallcaps}-LA (2.14 g, 14.82 mmol), and RS-β-benzyl malolactonate (1.15 g, 5.58 mmol) with 0.1 wt% (respect to the total weight of monomers) stannous octoate as a catalyst were added into polymerization tubes under nitrogen atmosphere. The tubes were then sealed under vacuum and placed into an oil bath at 120°C for 24 hours. The viscous liquid (4sPLMBz) was dissolved in chloroform and precipitated into ethyl ether. The white precipitates were obtained after removing the solvents. The product was confirmed using ^1^H-NMR.

Synthesis of biodegradable star-shaped mPEG-4sPLMBz copolymers
--------------------------------------------------------------

mPEG2000 (1 g, 0.5 mmol), 4sPLMBz (1.5 g, 2.5 mmol), and DMAP (0.015 g, 0.123 mmol) were dissolved in anhydrous dichloromethane (DCM) (20 mL) under nitrogen atmosphere, and DCC (5 g, 0.0243 mol) was dissolved in DCM (10 mL) and added dropwise into the mixture in an ice bath and stirred for 1 hour. After being stirred for 48 hours, the reaction solution was filtered, saturated, and precipitated in cold anhydrous diethyl ether. To remove the excess mPEG, the solution was packaged into a dialysis bag (Mw =3,500 g/mol) and was dialyzed exhaustively against DCM. Finally, the powder was dried under vacuum.

Synthesis of cRGD and disulfide-bearing PEG-ss-4sPLMBz copolymers
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Synthesis was done in two steps. First, the disulfide-functionalized PEG2000 (Mal-PEG2000-ss-COOH)

It is important to apply a discrete choice experiment (DCE) in prioritizing the characteristics according to patients' perspective. DCE potentially is useful to extract the priorities in providing health care. This method estimates the importance of different features that health has and overall it measures satisfaction or benefit from the services. Discrete choice experiment can estimate the characteristics of the various services and how we evaluate these characteristics and their replacements (substitution).DCE depends on the following assumptions first, it assumes that each service can be described by different attributes and second they serve different characteristics depending on their nature.

DCE compared with direct measurement of willingness to pay have more important data acquired because it detects characteristics of products or services and shows how these characteristics affect the utility, and due to characteristics compared QALY has a better and wider framework for measuring the utility ([@A12851R6]).

2. Objectives {#sec25599}
=============

Due to the uniqueness of characteristics of the health centers, and the importance of patient's opinion and their association in the decision-making process, this research prioritizes the hospital services quality according to the patients' point of view in terms of measuring the patients attitude and by also applying the logistic model. fo

=======================

The main objective of this study is recognizing the patients' priority to receive hospital services applying the Logit econometric model. The Logit(logistic regression)model is simply a non-linear transformation of the linear regression. The \"logistic\" distribution is an S-shaped distribution function which is similar to the standard-normal distribution (which results in a probit regression model) but easier to work with in most applications (the probabilities are easier to calculate). The logit distribution constrains the estimated probabilities to lie between 0 and 1.

In the formula Y stands for utility and is our dependent variable; X is our independent variable; X~1~ stands for waiting time from arrival until hospital admission; X~2~is for the handling of patients by medical staff at the hospital;X~3~ is for examination type;X~4~is for personnel behavior; and X~5~ is for sector and toilets cleaning; and α is the Intercept.

This study is a descriptive cross-sectional study, and in term of the results it can be classified to an applied study, where the data were collected by a questionnaire. Designing of the questionnaire, characteristics, and different level

Peptide and protein drugs are usually available for parenteral use in the market. Their conventional oral administration is not possible due to enzymatic degradation in GI tract. Repeated parenteral administration is necessary since their half-lives are too short (a few minutes). To solve the problems, improve patient compliance and provide an effective treatment, researchers have studied non-parenteral administration routes such as transdermal and nasal for years. As an alternative, the development of parenteral drug carriers, which will provide controlled drug release over a month or longer, has been attempted. SLN are promising colloidal drug carriers among many other carriers such as their polymeric counterparts and liposomes. [@b120-ijn-2-289] intensively reviewed parenteral use of SLN. SLN are very suitable for systemic delivery because they consist of physiologically well-tolerated ingredients and they have good storage capabilities after lyophilization and/or sterilization. When injected intravenously, SLN are sufficiently small to circulate in the microvascular system and prevent macrophage uptake in case of hydrophilic coating. Therefore, SLN have been suggested for viral and non-viral gene delivery. Cationic SLN has been demonstrated to bind genes directly via electrostatic interactions, and to have potential benefits in targeted gene therapy in treatment of cancer. The charge of particles can also be modulated via the composition, thus allowing binding of oppositely charged molecules ([@b77-ijn-2-289]; [@b106-ijn-2-289]; [@b83-ijn-2-289]). Moreover, coating of SLN with PEG increases stability and plasma half life of SLN in order to decrease phagocytic uptake, and therefore improves the biovailability of drugs.

Treatment of central nervous system diseases such as brain tumors, AIDS, neurological and psychiatric disorders is often constrained by the inability of potent drugs to pass blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is formed by the endothelium of the brain vessels, the basal membrane and neurological cells. Hydrophilic coating of colloids improves the transport of these through BBB and tissue distribution ([@b52-ijn-2-289]; [@b116-ijn-2-289]). Various researchers also reported that tumor microvessels were more permeable to macromolecules than normal blood vessels, and their lower selectivity to permeability was presumably due to larger pores in the vessel walls ([@b124-ijn-2-289]).

The same procedure was done in both patients. Patients were monitored by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) during operation. Operation was carried out via a median sternotomy with standard cardiopulmonary bypass through aortic and bicaval cannulations. An intermittent antegrade tepid blood cardioplegia infusion was used for myocardial protection. After aortic cross-clamping, the ascending aorta was resected and sectioned at the level about 1 cm above the STJ (**[Fig. 2D](#F2){ref-type="fig"}**). A left atriotomy along the right interatrial groove was performed. Mitral valve was repaired by posterior annuloplasty with an annuloplasty semi-rigid band (Cosgrove-Edwards, 34 mm, Edwards Lifesciences, LLC). Body temperature was cooled to 20°C. Distal ascending aorta up to the proximal arch was resected and replaced with a one-branch aortic polyester graft (Gelweave, 26mm, Terumo, Vascutek, UK; **[Fig. 2E](#F2){ref-type="fig"}**) during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Retrograde cerebral perfusion was used for de-airing. After completion of distal aorta anastomosis, the arterial cannulation was shifted to the side branch of the aortic graft. Cardiopulmonary bypass was restarted and the patient was rewarmed.

As I write this preface in April 2020, the world is in the grip of a hitherto unimagined coronavirus pandemic which has turned all our lives upside down and sadly ended the lives of many thousands. My wife and I have been in lockdown, along with many millions of others, for over 4 weeks, and this is set to continue for some while, perhaps until the pandemic abates. By some miracle the authors of this volume have all managed to complete their individual chapters, so I will start by thanking them and their families for their tremendous efforts at this extraordinary time.

That most of us will emerge intact is in no small measure due to the bravery, hard work, and dedication of countless medical and clinical staff. They and the politicians of many countries have been guided by the insights of the scientific community, who have been rapidly learning what a hard target COVID-19 has proved to be. Once the world enters, what will undoubtedly be a long period of economic and social recovery, then will be the time for nations to reassess where their scientific priorities are best directed. It is safe to assume that much future effort will be focused on innovative therapies for communicable diseases, and it is to end that the concepts presented in this book are directed. Hitherto, quadruplex targeting by small molecules has in large part been applied to human cancers, and we are beginning to see the fruits of this with compounds coming into clinical trial. This effort will surely continue, but as shown in several chapters in this book, application of the concept to viral and other diseases can work, at least in the laboratory. Medicinal chemistry is crucial in ensuring that a compound that starts off with potency against its targets and in cells, can realistically be developed into a therapeutic agent for human use.

The quadruplex therapeutic concept, detailed by Laurence Hurley in his Foreword, is just 23 years old. In 2006, Shankar Balasubramanian and I edited a book on quadruplexes, comprehensively covering both fundamental and more applied aspects of the field. This level of coverage is no longer possible, with currently over 6000 primary publications in the literature. The field has also moved on, from being initially mostly chemistry-based, to one in which the role of quadruplexes in biological processes are the focus of much investigation. This book aims to illustrate both to those new to the topic and experienced practitioners, how chemistry and biology is coming together to create effective ways of targeting quadruplexes. It highlights a number

Additional insights into the timing and importance of inflammasomes in CNS injury have been gained from recent TBI studies. In an FPI model, inflammasome components, such as ASC and caspase-1, were shown to be upregulated in cortical neurons for up to 24 h post-injury ([@B110]). Co-immunoprecipitation of inflammasome proteins also demonstrated that NLRP1 and ASC could be detected in multiprotein complexes in the brain. Treatment with an ASC-neutralizing antibody reduced caspase-1 activation and IL-1β production while also decreasing lesion volume, suggesting beneficial effects of targeting inflammasome activity. Liu et al. also recently showed that TBI results in upregulated expression of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1. Moreover, they report that the expression of these inflammasome-associated proteins can remain elevated out to 7 days post-injury ([@B111]). Importantly, inflammasome components in this model localized not only to neurons, but also to astrocytes and microglia, suggesting a wide range of inflammasome activation across cell types. Measurements of IL-1β and IL-18 protein levels also demonstrated that while IL-1β peaks around 6 h after injury and subsequently decreases over time, IL-18 expression remains elevated through 7 days after injury. In agreement with these findings, a separate study also reported elevated IL-18 production for at least a week post-TBI in both humans and experimental animals ([@B112]). These data suggest that early inflammasome production of IL-1β may be involved in acute inflammation and tissue damage, while inflammasome-driven IL-18 may contribute to the perpetuation of TBI-induced inflammation. It should be noted, however, that in a more recent study neither NLRP1 nor ASC knockout mice exhibited any improvements in lesion volume, histopathology, cell death, or motor function following CCI injury ([@B81]). It is possible that differences in the extent of caspase-1 abrogation and/or the timing of inflammasome inhibition or differences in injury models may help explain the disparate results that were reported in these studies.

Although key roles for inflammasomes have been clearly identified in other models of sterile inflammation and trauma, the specific contributions of inflammasome activation to TBI pathogenesis have only recently been investigated and multiple questions remain. For instance, although the formation of inflammasome complexes has been reported following TBI, the roles that specific inflammasomes play in driving TBI-associated pathology and neurological dysfunction have not

Samples were prepared according to an established procedure[@b41]. Briefly, cells were fixed in a solution containing 2% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 0.2 M sodium cacodylate for 1 h. Fixed cells were suspended in a buffered solution containing 1% osmic acid for 1 h, followed by dehydration in a graded ethanol series, washing with acetone and embedding into EPON epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections (60--80 nm) were prepared on an ultramicrotome and double-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. All sections were examined and photographed with a Hitachi H-600 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan).

Discussion {#sec11-0300060517719768}
==========

Our study revealed a trend toward higher long-term mortality, a more difficult ICU treatment course, and no significant difference in the cost of antimicrobial treatment in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and a positive PCR assay.

Our data regarding ICU, hospital, and long-term mortality are in line with previously published studies evaluating the role of PCR assays in sepsis in which the ICU mortality rate was 39.1%,^[@bibr6-0300060517719768]^ 34.3%,^[@bibr7-0300060517719768]^ and 29.7%,^[@bibr5-0300060517719768]^ respectively, compared with 40.0% in the present study. High mortality rates in the ICU (up to 80%), during hospitalization (up to 90%), and in the long term have also been previously reported; additionally, 20% of survivors of sepsis die within 1 month of hospital discharge, 40% die within 1 year, and 80% within 5 years.^[@bibr11-0300060517719768],[@bibr12-0300060517719768]^ To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate long-term mortality in patients in whom the SF assay was used. Our data regarding the requirement for mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support, and renal replacement therapy are also in line with previously published studies.^[@bibr11-0300060517719768],[@bibr12-0300060517719768]^

A higher rate of PCR than BC positivity has been observed in several studies. Tafelski et al.^[@bibr13-0300060517719768]^ performed a prospective interventional study using the SF assay in 41 patients with sepsis, and 49% of patients developed septic shock. They found positive SF results in 10 (24.4%) patients and positive BC results in 5 (12.2%) patients. In three (7.3%) patients, only the SF assay was positive while the BC and all other microbiological samples remained negative.^[@bibr13-0300060517719768]^ Brealey et al.^[@bibr14-0300060517719768]^ performed a multicentric study in patients with suspected sepsis using a new diagnostic system that enables whole-blood analysis and combines two identification techniques (PCR and electrospray ionization--mass spectrometry \[ESI-MS\]). In their study, 169 positive PCR/ESI-MS results (from a total of 609 samples) were BC-

While some descriptions of the white matter anatomy found in *Anatomie des centres nerveux*will be familiar to the modern reader, many are steeped in controversy. The following section is devoted to the tracts that have stirred up debate in both the modern and the historical literature. Many of the tracts already described have been debated, discussed and redefined throughout history. However, some remain more controversial than others.

The occipito-frontal fasciculus ([Fig. 5](#awx225-F5){ref-type="fig"}) is a tract of particular contention ([@awx225-B13]). While first reportedly described by Forel and Onufrowicz in acallosal patients, the modern consensus is that this original description was of a heterotopic callosum rather than the fronto-occipital fasciculus ([@awx225-B7]). As such, the Dejerines are often credited as the first to describe an actual front-occipital fasciculus ([@awx225-B12]). The modern literature, however, often refers to the Dejerines' occipito-frontal fasciculus as the superior fronto-occipital fasciculus. This contrasts with a fasciculus that also connects the occipital lobe to the frontal lobe but which courses ventrally through the extreme capsule complex, and is often referred to as the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. Not all researchers, however, agree with this distinction, arguing that the occipito-frontal fasciculus of Dejerine is the only true fasciculus connecting these two lobes ([@awx225-B13]). In contrast, others maintain that the Dejerines' occipito-frontal fasciculus is not an actual tract ([@awx225-B15]), or posit that the superior fronto-occipital fasciculus is an 'occipital extension' of the superior longitudinal fasciculus ([@awx225-B7]). Furthermore, there has also been discussion as to whether the superior fronto-occipital fasciculus and the subcallosal bundle of Muratoff are the same tract, as implied by the Dejerines, or whether they are two separate bundles ([@awx225-B12]). The occipito-frontal fasciculi, both superior and inferior, remain two of the modern neuroscience's most often debated tracts.

Drug sensitivity and dose responsive curve assay {#s4_2}
------------------------------------------------

For cell viability screening, cells \[BE(2)-C:1500/well, LAN-1: 3000/well; CHP-212:4000/well; SK-N-AS: 3000/well\] were plated and treated the following day with methotrexate and pralatrexate. Cell growth was determined after 72 h of continuous exposure to 0.1 nM--25 μM of methotrexate or pralatrexate using Cell Titer Glo^TM^ reagent (Promega), with luminescence measured using an EnVision multi-label plate reader (Perkin-Elmer, Inc.).

Cell viability assay {#s4_3}
--------------------

Neuroblastoma cells were seeded onto 96-well plates, permitted to attach overnight and were treated with either pralatrexate (5 or 10 nM) or DMSO for 4 days. Cell viability measurements using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc, Rockville, MD) were obtained daily.

3D colony formation assay {#s4_4}
-------------------------

BE(2)-C or LAN-1 cells were trypsinized, embedded in 35 μl of Cultrex^®^ RGF BME Type 2 matrix hydrogel (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD), and seeded in 48-well plates (200 cells/well). RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS was added with pralatrexate treatment and incubated for 7 days. Colonies were photographed and the number and size were quantified. The colonies were counted from three separate microscopic fields and their size was measured by the scale bar on each image using Image J.

Cell cycle analysis {#s4_5}
-------------------

Cell cycle distribution was analyzed using flow cytometry with propidium iodide (Sigma Aldrich). BE(2)-C cells were plated at equal numbers (1 × 10^6^ cells) and treated with either pralatrexate (10 nM) or DMSO. At day 1 and 2 after treatment, cells were washed and fixed in 70% ethanol. Fixed cells were incubated with 100 mg/mL RNAase for 30 minutes at 37°C, stained with propidium iodide (50 mg/ mL), and analyzed on a BD FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).

Prepared primary proforma to evaluate excessive use of sour taste

![](AYU-35-124-g001)

Statistical analysis {#sec2-5}
--------------------

After collection of data, it was presented in 2 × 2 table for each symptom. The odds ratio for each symptom was analyzed to estimate the relative risk for a symptom in relation to a given risk factor (*Amlarasa Atiyoga*). Confidence interval (CI) (95%) was also analyzed to observe that data was whether statistically significant or not.

Result {#sec1-3}
======

A total of 178 volunteers were interviewed for the survey study. Patients with overuse of *Amlarasa* were distributed with regard to age and gender. Odds ratio with CI-95% was calculated accordingly \[[Table 2](#T2){ref-type="table"}\]. In relation to age group, the odds ratio was 1.48, 1.56, 2 in young, middle and old aged subjects respectively which indicates positive association between *Atiyoga* of sour taste and age. It may be due to decrease of tolerability toward sour taste as age progresses. No difference in odds ratio was observed in both male and female which reveals that there no relationship between *Atiyoga* of *Amlarasa* and gender.

Cases and controls of each symptom according to exposure of excess sour taste are distributed in [Table 3](#T3){ref-type="table"}. 1.95 odds ratio for dentine hypersensitivity calculated based on numbers of exposed and unexposed subjects in case and control group indicates increased chances of dentine hypersensitivity in people who consume *Amlarasa* in excess amount. The 95% CI of odds ratio (0.97-3.93) indicates that odds of dentine hypersensitivity cases are not significantly higher for *Amlarasa Atisevana* (excess intake of sour taste) group at 95% significance level because the CI contains 1 numeral. Odds ratio (2.45) for stomatitis for the exposed group compared with unexposed group indicates moderate positive association between exposure (excess sour taste) and outcome (stomatitis). CI (1.12-5.40) at 95% level also indicates result is statistically significant because it\'s

Among samples from the industry, the highest number of yeast species was detected in the curd after acidification ([Table 3](#t3-bjm-44-701){ref-type="table"}). The acidification time can last 4 to 4.5 h in this industry, and it can explain the yeast contamination found in the curd; this contamination might originate from the hands of the manipulators or from contaminated utensils that may have come in contact with the cheese. Yeast is able to grow in milk and dairy products due to their ability to assimilate and ferment lactose, assimilate citric and lactic acids, produce lipases and extracellular proteases, and tolerate a high salt content ([@b13-bjm-44-701]; [@b2-bjm-44-701]). [@b2-bjm-44-701] suggest that yeasts contribute to the organoleptic definition of the water buffalo Mozzarella. According to these authors the recorded dominance of fermenting yeasts such as the lactose-fermenting *Kluyveromyces marxianus* (38.3% of the total isolates) and the galactose-fermenting *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (21.6% of the total isolates) suggests that these yeasts contribute to the organoleptic definition of the water buffalo Mozzarella produced in the provinces of Salerno, Caserta, and Frosinone (Italy). In the present work, yeast species found in curds such as *Debaryomyces hansenii* and *Kluveromyces lactis* can modify the organoleptic characteristics of the cheese, since first species can ferment galactose, and the second is able to ferment lactose. Species such as *Candida catenulata*, *C. krusei*, *C. parapsilosis* and *C. rugosa* found in the curd samples can be considered contaminants of the production process.

The number of yeast species was lower in mozzarella than in curd after acidification. This result can be due to the stretching of the cheese in hot water (90 to 95 ºC) which may have reduced the presence of these microorganisms. [@b30-bjm-44-701] demonstrated that exposure of the cheese to hot water can reduce the level of yeast and fecal contamination up to 1,000 times. Yeasts were not isolated from the starter culture samples collected from

Expression of RparsM in *P. putida* KT2440 {#sec2.3}
------------------------------------------

Plasmid pBAM1 and its derivatives were delivered from *E. coli* CC118λpir (pBAM1 or pBAM1-*RparsM-gfp*) donor cells into *P. putida* KT2440 by tripartite mating with the assistance of the helper strain *E. coli* HB101 (pRK600).^[@ref21]^ The conjugation mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 6 to 8 h by tripartite mating on membrane filters (0.45 μm, Millipore) on LB agar plates. The filter was transferred to 5 mL of 10 mM MgSO~4~ and vortexed to suspend the cells. Afterward, appropriate dilutions were plated onto selective medium as indicated for counter-selecting against the donor cells. The conjugation mixture was plated on minimal selective medium as indicated. *P. putida* KT2440 containing different expression vectors were cultured overnight in LB medium at 30 °C. Cells were harvested and identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Western blot analysis was used to probe the expression of *RparsM*. Proteins separated by SDS PAGE were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Protran, Schleicher & Schuell). Western blot analysis was performed using a Western Lighting Ultra chemiluminescence substrate kit (PerkinElmer) using an antimouse IgG to the six histidine tag.

Resistance Assays to Arsenic {#sec2.4}
----------------------------

The arsenic resistance phenotype of GE *P. putida* KT2440 cells was determined in bacteria. Cells of wild type bacteria (bearing pBAM1), and bacteria bearing pBAM1-*RparsM*, which were used for inorganic arsenic sensitivity assays, were grown overnight in M9 medium^[@ref26]^ at 30 °C, supplemented with containing 25 μg/mL kanamycin and 0.2% glucose. Overnight cultures were adjusted to 1.0 OD~600~, diluted in a 10-fold series with double distilled water, and spotted (2 μL) onto M9 solid medium supplemented with the indicated concentrations of arsenite and antibiotics.^[@ref23]^ Growth was scored after incubation at 30 °C for 24 h. The growth rate of the two strains in liquid medium was also monitored. After growing in LB liquid medium

The item characteristic curves (ICCs) for the seven IPSS items, the QoL item, and the BII~summary~ item in the unidimensional integrated BPH-LUTS IRT model are shown in Fig. [2](#Fig2){ref-type="fig"}**,** and the corresponding ICC parameter estimates are shown in Table [I](#Tab1){ref-type="table"}. The latter were overall estimated with low uncertainty, although higher uncertainty was observed for BII~summary~ difficulty parameters. The discrimination parameter value was lowest for the *Nocturia* IPSS item (0.55) and highest for the QoL item (1.22), indicating that they respectively have the lowest and highest sensitivity to change in disability. Adequate fit of the ICCs was observed with GAM diagnostics and these are shown in the [Supplemental Material](#MOESM1){ref-type="media"}.Fig. 2Item characteristic curves in the unidimensional integrated item response theory model.

Higher CD4 initiation rates were also supported for family members, even in a less-than optimal environment. Doctors with an infectious diseases qualification were as likely to follow WHO initiation guidelines as other doctors, and there was no difference between exclusively public sector or private sector doctors.

With only access to d4T-based regimens, doctors would generally start at a considerably lower CD4 count for themselves than if all antiretrovirals were available (*P* \<0.001). Many would only initiate a d4T-based regimen at a CD4\<200 cells/μl, or even with the onset of HIV-related symptoms. The open-ended question asking what single side effect concerned them the most demonstrated that lactic acidosis and lipoatrophy were overwhelmingly causes for concern, followed by peripheral neuropathy.

Given access to all available drugs, more than three-quarters of doctors would use the WHO recommended first line fixed dose combination of tenofovir (TDF), emtricitabine (or the equivalent analogue, lamivudine) and efavirenz (EFV) for themselves, suggesting high confidence in the efficacy and side effect profile of the combination. A minority would replace EFV with raltegravir, nevirapine, atazanavir or darunavir, citing potency or concerns about EFV side effects. Private care doctors were more likely to use these alternatives than their public sector counterparts. Concerns about side effects with their preferred regimen were largely divided between the nephrotoxicity associated with TDF (55%), and the central nervous system effects associated with EFV (29%).

A large majority of doctors would use influenza prophylaxis

PDE4 enzymes play an important role in glucose metabolism ([@b33-etm-0-0-7428]), and Vollert *et al* used a rat model of type 2 diabetes to examine the effects of PDE4i on GLP-1 and insulin, both of which are important hormones for glucose metabolism. Their results demonstrated that PDE4i protects against diabetes via two important mechanisms: i) Increased secretion of intestinal GLP-1, which decreases the serum glucose level via increasing the secretion of insulin; and ii) enhanced secretion of insulin in the pancreas as a result of its protective effect on pancreatic islets ([@b33-etm-0-0-7428]). As such, the effect of PDE4i on glucose metabolism may be due to the increase in the GLP-1 level, which is hypothesized to be responsible for reducing weight gain. According to earlier findings and those of the present study, the effects of PDE4i, including increasing the cAMP level, which leads to lipolysis, and increasing the GLP-1 level, which decreases the glucose level, may result in reduced weight gain, and PDE4i may be considered as a novel therapeutic option for treating obesity and obesity-related diseases, such as PCOS; however, the weight loss potential of PDE4i in humans is not fully understood and must be elucidated via additional research.

PCOS is characterized by follicular developmental arrest without atresia during the small antral stage of folliculogenesis and, consequently, there is a lack of dominant follicle development and ovulation ([@b34-etm-0-0-7428]). The main cause of follicular arrest is disruption of the balance between androgens, gonadotropins and anti-Müllerian hormone ([@b34-etm-0-0-7428]). In cases with PCOS, the hormonal balance shifts to the androgen side and, as a result, causes anovulation, as ovarian theca cells produce excessive androgen with the additive effect of insulin-like growth factor-1 and insulin on LH, increasing androgen production ([@b35-etm-0-0-7428], [@b36-etm-0-0-7428]). In addition, insulin can directly increase the activity of ovarian P450c17 and P450scc enzymes, which produce ovarian androgens ([@b37-etm-0-0-7428]). Similar to hyperinsulinemia, increased fat deposition and weight gain is positively correlated with hyperandrogenemia ([@b38-

We reported on a case of intrasphenoidal encephalocele of the temporal lobe through the defect of the lateral wall of the sphenoid sinus. To the best of our knowledge, 63 cases were reported on in English literature \[[@b4-poljradiol-79-360]\].

Case Report
===========

We reported on a 40-year-old man with complaints of headache and rhinorrhea, and a history of meningitis three times in the last 4 years, as well as no history of head trauma. His rhinorea was present for the last 6 months, as he stated.

Otolaryngologic examination was normal except for rhinorrhea. Hemogram was normal. In order to determine the etiology of CSF rhinorrhea, paranasal sinus CT was obtained and a bone defect in the lower part of the lateral wall of the left sphenoid sinus was determined. Moreover, polypoid mass with the same density as the brain tissue beside the defect was seen in the left sphenoid sinus ([Figure 1](#f1-poljradiol-79-360){ref-type="fig"}). What is more, bilateral, apparent petrous apex pneumatization was noticed. In order to identify the structure of the polypoid mass in the left sphenoid sinus, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrasting agent was obtained. In brain MRI, intrasphenoidal encephalocele was seen ([Figure 2](#f2-poljradiol-79-360){ref-type="fig"}). With those findings, the patient underwent transnasal endoscopic surgery. Incisional biopsy was taken from the polypoid mass in the sphenoid sinus ([Figure 3](#f3-poljradiol-79-360){ref-type="fig"}). The histological examination of the specimens taken from the sphenoid sinus revealed glial tissue in fibrovascular connective tissue fragments of mucosa coated by respiratory-type epithelium ([Figure 4A](#f4-poljradiol-79-360){ref-type="fig"}). Immunohistochemical stains for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and S-100 confirmed the diagnosis ([Figure 4B](#f4-poljradiol-79-360){ref-type="fig"}).

Intrasphenoidal encephalocele (ISE) is a rare clinical condition. The incidence of congenital encephalocele is approximately 1 in 3000--5000 live birth \[[@b5

The national and regional baselines are the mean percentage of visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) during noninfluenza weeks for the previous three seasons plus two standard deviations. Noninfluenza weeks are defined as periods of ≥2 consecutive weeks in which each week accounted for \<2% of the season's total number of specimens that tested positive for influenza in public health laboratories. National and regional percentages of patient visits for ILI are weighted based on state population. Use of the national baseline for regional data is not appropriate.

The seasonal baseline proportion of pneumonia and influenza (P&I) deaths is projected using a robust regression procedure, in which a periodic regression model is applied to the observed percentage of deaths from P&I that were reported by the National Center for Health Statistics Mortality Surveillance System during the preceding 5 years. The epidemic threshold is set at 1.645 standard deviations above the seasonal baseline.

In temperate climates, the onset and peak of influenza activity might vary substantially from one influenza season to the next, but generally begins to increase in the late fall. In the Northern Hemisphere\'s temperate regions, annual epidemics of influenza typically occur during October--February, but the peak of influenza activity can occur as late as April or May. In temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere, influenza activity typically peaks during May through August. Although temperate regions of the world experience a seasonal peak in influenza activity, influenza viruses can be isolated year-round. The timing of seasonal peaks in influenza activity in tropical and subtropical countries varies by region. Multiple peaks of activity during the same year have been seen in some areas and influenza infection can occur year-round.

Nine months later, our patient developed a painful bone relapse. The pain was severe, constant and localized primarily in her sacrum and the right iliac wing. The pain increased to some extent with movement. Our patient received local radiotherapy on both sites (2000cGy/5 fractions), achieving a reduction in symptoms and an improvement of her performance status.

One year after the initial diagnosis, our patient presented to our emergency department because of the new appearance of signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure: dyspnea, hypotension, cyanosis and facial edema.

CT of her chest revealed an increase in the size of the mass (78mm × 84mm), which appeared to infiltrate her right pulmonary vein and superior vena cava for approximately 21mm, causing neoplastic thrombosis of her right subclavian vein (Figure [1](#F1){ref-type="fig"}A). These findings were confirmed by echocardiography and F18-FDG PET (Figure [1](#F1){ref-type="fig"}B).

Restaging examinations documented stable bone disease.

Our patient was evaluated by a surgeon for possible surgery on her right atrium, but she was considered inoperable due to the extent of the disease. The diagnosis of atrial localization of malignant plasmacytoma was confirmed via examination of a biopsy specimen. In order to obtain rapid control of the intracardiac disease, radiation to the cardiac mass was started.

External-beam radiation, totaling 3000cGy in 10 daily fractions of 300cGy, each with 6mV photons, was delivered using the intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) technique.

Our patient was immobilized in the supine position with a wing board and target localization was accomplished using CT simulation. The volumes of interest were identified on each axial CT slice. The gross tumor volume was defined as the gross extent of the tumor shown by imaging (CT, MRI and PET); the clinical target volume was defined as the gross tumor volume plus a margin for potential microscopic spread (5mm); and, in order to account for organ motion and patient setup errors, the planning target volume was defined by adding a 1 cm margin to the clinical target volume.

Given the PCA analysis here did not allow us to identify which SNPs constituted the principal components that contributed to the framing effect ([@nsx062-B40]), we examined directly how identified gene-behavior associations were distributed across SNPs in the identified genes. SNPs associated with individual susceptibility to framing are shown in Figure S2 ([Supplementary data](#sup1){ref-type="supplementary-material"}). For the *COMT* gene, although rs4680 did not significantly contribute to the framing effect, a SNP in LD with rs4680, rs165656 (1000Genomes, phase_3, Han Chinese in Beijing, China (CHB): *r^2^* = 0.934, *D'* = 1.000; 1000Genomes, phase_3, Southern Han Chinese, China (CHS): *r^2^* = 0.816, *D'* = 0.948; see also [@nsx062-B116]), *was* significantly associated with the susceptibility to framing (adjusted *R^2^* change = 0.004, partial-*F *= 5.842, *P* = 0.016). See [Supplementary data](#sup1){ref-type="supplementary-material"} for more details about individual SNP associations.

Discussion
==========

Twin studies yield a moderate heritability of the susceptibility to framing in decision-making ([@nsx062-B99]; [@nsx062-B13]; [@nsx062-B17]). Other studies also demonstrated important roles of genetic variations on dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways in decision-making under risks ([@nsx062-B18]; [@nsx062-B25]; [@nsx062-B62]; [@nsx062-B42]; [@nsx062-B32]; [@nsx062-B45]; [@nsx062-B88]; [@nsx062-B97]). By extending the few studies on the genetic basis of the framing effect ([@nsx062-B18]; [@nsx062-B90]; [@nsx062-B35]) and by using a gene-based PCReg approach, we investigated directly the relationship between 26 genes within the dopaminergic and the serotonergic pathways and individuals' susceptibility to framing in decision-making.

Replicating the previous SNP-based studies, which had relatively small sample size, our results confirmed that genetic variations in the *COMT

LAUNCH made programmatic adjustments in response to findings from the monitoring system; these changes were then reflected in subsequent quarterly trends, indicating that the availability of timely data enabled the project to react quickly to issues and adapt activities appropriately. For example, in quarter 1 (April--June 2012), the findings revealed low participation in Care Groups, mother groups, and farmer groups. In the following quarters, there was a continual increase (more than doubling) in participation in these groups, from 30% to 80% and from 9% to 40%, respectively. This increase reflects an adjustment made by management, using real-time data, to actively focus on fostering better integration between food distribution and community programs ([Table 2](#tab2){ref-type="table"}). Similarly, as the program scaled up food distribution and expanded the number of food recipients, the system provided evidence to increase the number of FDPs over time (from 9 to 14) and confirmed that their locations were well placed with relatively short distances for recipients to access, a project priority to make food distribution easily available.

Participation in Care Groups and mother and farmer groups more than doubled between the first and subsequent quarters, reflecting project adjustments made using real-time data from the mobile-based monitoring system.

Lateral temporal cortex volumes were extracted in the left and the right hemisphere according to the following subregions: superior temporal gyrus, inferior temporal region---including middle and inferior temporal gyrus---and temporal pole (see [Figure 1(a)](#fig1){ref-type="fig"}). This cortical parcellation was done for each patient using a multiatlas label propagation approach. The image processing pipeline consisted of the following steps: (1) a skull-stripping step \[[@B61]\] was performed with the Freesurfer image analysis suite, freely available for download online (<http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu>); (2) each MR image was given B0 nonuniformity correction (using Freesurfer) and ITK-based histogram matching using an arbitrarily chosen patient image as a reference histogram; (3) a set of 16 anatomically annotated images (obtained from the NIREP project, <http://www.nirep.org>) was registered in a nonlinear way on each patient image \[[@B62]\] using the ANTs software (<http://www.picsl.upenn.edu/ANTS>); (4) cortical labels were fused \[[@B63]\] using the simultaneous truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE); (5) final cortical parcellation was obtained by fusing logical and estimated labels using STAPLE and the gray matter mask obtained with the Freesurfer image analysis suite.

Hippocampal volume, as well as the total gray matter volume (TGM), was investigated using the subcortical labeling method \[[@B64]\] provided in the freesurfer software ([http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu](http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/)/; see [Figure 1(b)](#fig1){ref-type="fig"}).

2.4. Statistical Analysis {#sec2.4}

Intergroup comparisons were tested using Student\'s *t*-test for quantitative demographic characteristics (age distribution and education level). With regard to the MCT, which was primarily designed to elicit specific memories, we broke up the participants\' responses into two categories: "specific responses" (i.e., memories scored 4 and 5) and "total responses" (i.e., memories scored 2 to 5), the latter reflecting the ability to elicit "general responses." This was decided owing to the type

Knowledge of driver mutations in MM led to the development of the Vk*∗*MYC \[[@B16]\] and Myc/Bcl-X~L~ \[[@B17]\]*myc*-overexpressing mouse models of myeloma, and the E*μ*-XBP-1s model \[[@B18]\]. All spontaneously develop MM-like tumor dissemination and paraprotein over a longer latency, with greater heterogeneity of disease than single clonal transplant. However, the time to disease is a greatly limiting factor at the bench. Syngeneic transplant of cells retrieved from diseased Vk*∗*MYC mice has similar MM-like disease but with faster kinetics \[[@B16]\], and the myeloma cells are responsive to most conventional therapies used in humans \[[@B19]\].

Less commonly used now are the plasmacytoma-resembling murine MM cell lines (MOPC315, J558, HOPC) that have been transplanted subcutaneously in syngeneic mice. These were obtained from granulomas arising from the intraperitoneal injection of mineral oil in Balb/c mice. The cell line MOPC315.BM has been derived from MOPC315 cells that exhibit bone marrow tropism \[[@B20]\].

3. The Tumor Microenvironment and Immune Dysfunction in MM {#sec3}
==========================================================

It is well established that MM cells influence the BM microenvironment to sustain tumor survival. This is achieved by pathologies that include osteoclastogenesis, increased angiogenesis, and immune editing. The role of xenograft and 5T murine models of MM to assess the efficacy of therapeutic agents for bone disease was reviewed recently \[[@B21]\].

Immunosurveillance describes the processes by which the immune system recognizes and eliminates foreign pathogens and tumor cells. This theory has been refined over the last 15 years to the concept of "immune editing", which is a dynamic process composed of three phases: (1) elimination, (2) equilibrium, and (3) escape \[[@B22]\]. In MM, the equilibrium phase is most noteworthy as it represents a therapeutic opportunity to utilize the immune system to slow or prevent disease progression. Immunosurveillance has been demonstrated in the Vk*∗*MYC mouse model, where immune control of MM was demonstrated via NK and CD8^+^ T cells through CD226 (DNAM-1) interaction with its ligand CD155 on malignant plasma cells \[[@B23]\].

The survey was carried out during the full month of December 2013 and first half of January 2014: in this period a total of 252 physicians responded to the survey; they were distributed among the above-mentioned categories that took part, thus enabling a heterogeneous and interdisciplinary overview of the topic under investigation. The enrollment of participants highlighted the positive synergy between "web-based" technologies \[[@CR2]\] and the social networks \[[@CR2], [@CR3]\] alongside the normal, classic system of invitation to participate carried out by bulk mailing. The initiative was promoted at several occasions through the social network channels where AIMAR has for some time been present. Through its own page in Facebook (institutional group profile \[[@CR2]\] and official Twitter channel \[[@CR3]\]), it was possible to reach rapidly a large number of heterogeneous participants spread throughout the national territory (confirming once again the "viral" effect of the social networks in involving people and circulating information).

Results and discussion {#Sec3}
======================

Overall 252 questionnaires were collected, subdivided into: Pneumologists = 180,GPs = 32, Internal Medicine specialists = 20, Allergologists = 8, other Specialists = 12.

Epidemiological aspects {#Sec4}
-----------------------

In the sample of physicians interviewed (Figure [1](#Fig1){ref-type="fig"}), complex forms of asthma and COPD were retained to be frequently encountered and present in a percentage varying from approximately 10% to 50% of patients visited; this is substantially in line with evidence from retrospective studies that report estimates of prevalence up to approximately 28.5% \[[@CR4]--[@CR6]\]. The remaining part of respiratory patients was composed of individuals with COPD only, individuals with asthma only with childhood onset, and individuals with asthma only with late onset (over 45 years).Figure 1**Considering your patients with bronchial asthma and/or COPD, on average what percentage have.**

Complex forms of bronchial asthma and COPD are retained typical of patients with a previous history of asthma. It is now known that forms or phenotypes of severe chronic bronchial asthma exist and have similar characteristics to those of COPD, namely: accelerated lung function decline with a progression towards poorly reversible bronchial obstruction, neutrophils in sputum and/or inflammation difficult to control by therapy, elevated level of bronchial hyperreactivity, and frequent exacerbations \[[@CR4], [@CR7]--[@CR10]\].

Recombination events affecting the substrate specificity of the *mcyA*~*2*~ gene were detected in *Nostoc* sp. UK89IIa and *Phormidium* sp. CENA270 by four different methods (Table  [3](#T3){ref-type="table"}). Breakpoints with statistical support within the *mcyA* gene were identified in UK89IIa and CENA270 (Figure [7](#F7){ref-type="fig"}a). The identified predicted breakpoints were visualized in a recombination breakpoint distribution plot (Figure [7](#F7){ref-type="fig"}b). A lengthy region replaced in a recombination event in the *mcyA* gene in *Nostoc* sp. UK89IIa (1029 bp) and *Phormidium* sp. CENA270 (167 and 707 bp) was observed in the present study (Figure [7](#F7){ref-type="fig"}a). The predicted binding pockets responsible for amino acid selection and activation were found within this region in both cases.

Before the TRX suspension workouts, EMG data were collected using two five-second maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) trials against manual resistance for each of the four core muscles with a one-minute, between-trial rest period. Details for applying the manual resistance have been described in Mok et al. \[[@B9]\] and Escamilla et al. \[[@B21]\]. The average EMG~rms~ value during the middle three-second window of each trial was chosen as the representative MVIC value. The MVIC value of each core muscle was recorded for later data normalization \[[@B9]\].

During the TRX-EMG measurement, the participants were required to maintain each of the four TRX positions for five seconds while the EMG activity of the core muscles was being recorded. The RMS of the EMG activity of each core muscle was computed during a middle three-second period during which the participant held his or her position. Two trials were performed for each of the four testing conditions with a one-minute break between trials. The average EMG~rms~ value of two repetitions of each TRX suspension position was normalized against the RMS value of the MVIC of each core muscle, and thus the outcome was expressed as a percentage of MVIC (%MVIC). %MVIC was selected as the major outcome measure because the test-retest reliability was good (ICC = 0.64) \[[@B9]\].

Upon completion of the four TRX suspension workouts and simultaneous EMG recordings, elastic kinesiology taping (k tape, biviax GmbH & Co. KG, Dortmund, Germany) was applied to the low back region. The EMG electrodes were in firm contact with the skin all the time as the KT tapes were applied on top of the adhesive tapes. Each participant received a standardized kinesiology taping application with four I-strips being placed at about 25% tension overlapping in a star shape over the point of maximum pain in the lumbar region \[[@B10]\]. After fixing the tape, all of the above TRX-EMG measurement procedures were repeated. The %MVIC values of the four core muscles (with taping applied) were calculated and used for analysis.

Our statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS 20.0 software (IBM, Armonk, NY). The significance level was set at 0.05. A two-way repeated-measures ANOVA (within-subject factors: TRX position and tap

Patients with cognitive decline constitute an important geriatric subpopulation \[[@CR80]\]. For instance, in Alzheimer's disease (AD), neuropathological changes selectively impact the affective-motivational component of pain (medial pathway) more than the sensory-discriminative dimension (lateral pathway), which impairs the patient's ability to assess a painful experience. Combined with an unchanged pain threshold and a higher tolerance of painful stimuli typical of the elderly, AD patients have been observed to have a higher tolerance for intense pain that alters their experience of chronic pain \[[@CR80]\]. However, in other studies these changes were inconsequential, indicating no selective reduction in the emotional aspects of the pain experience in these patients \[[@CR81]\]. Another key point for AD patients is their altered response to analgesic medicines, in that they have little to no placebo effect, requiring a higher dose of pain medication to obtain an analgesic effect \[[@CR82]\]. Moreover, changes in the blood--brain barrier in AD patients can influence the effect of centrally acting pain medications such as opioids. For example, pain perception in vascular dementia may increase because of white matter lesions in pathways ascending to the thalamus, such as the spinothalamic tract, while pain perception in Lewy body dementia may be altered due to brain atrophy and damage caused by Lewy bodies \[[@CR80]\].

Of paramount importance is that both underreported or underestimated pain and comorbidities and polypharmacy are formidable barriers to effective pain control in the elderly. Avoiding potentially dangerous medications such as neuroleptics and benzodiazepines as pain relievers, and initiating treatment with non-opioid analgesics or gradual titration of pain regimens are crucial. SNRIs can be considered as adjuvants and/or as an alternative to NSAIDs and opioids \[[@CR80]\].

One additional obstacle in the elderly is compliance to therapy. This may be reduced when fixed-dose combinations of medicines are prescribed \[[@CR83]\]. Pain is always multifactorial. Hence, considering a multimodal approach to therapy is essential, especially in complex patients with many comorbid conditions.

Limitations {#Sec31}
-----------

This is not an exhaustive review of the current evidence. However, it provides the clinician with a perspective on pain therapy targeting the underlying pain mechanism(s) in complex pain syndromes. A further limiting aspect is that the review focuses on just a few complex pain syndromes. Further reviews on other pain syndromes will be necessary, using the same methodology.

Arch(D95H) Records a Photochemical Imprint of Action Potentials in a Neuron {#sec2.5}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

We tested whether Arch(D95H) could function as a flash memory sensor for recording neuronal action potentials. The submillisecond response of the protein to a flash of light at constant voltage (Figure [5](#fig5){ref-type="fig"}) indicated that the light-driven transition into the fluorescent state was fast compared to the duration of an action potential. However, the 48 ms response to a step in voltage under constant illumination ([Figure S7](#notes-1){ref-type="notes"}) implied that the voltage-dependent transition was slow: the rate of conformational change would low-pass filter the underlying voltage dynamics of the neuron. Despite this limitation, we tested whether Arch(D95H) could record an imprint of a single neuronal action potential.

We fused the C-terminus of Arch(D95H) to an endoplasmic reticulum export motif, followed by an eYFP expression marker and a trafficking sequence, as described in ref ([@ref23]) ([Materials and Methods](#sec4){ref-type="other"}). We cloned this construct into a lentiviral mammalian expression vector under the CaMKII promoter. Hippocampal neurons and glia were dissociated from postnatal day 0 (P0) rats and cultured on poly-[d]{.smallcaps}-lysine coated glass-bottomed dishes ([Materials and Methods](#sec4){ref-type="other"}). At 4 days *in vitro* (div) 2 μM AraC was added to suppress further glial growth. We transfected the cells with Arch(D95H)-eYFP at 7 div using calcium phosphate, and we measured activity at 12--15 div. At the time of measurement, our construct had trafficked to the plasma membranes of the soma and processes, although considerable protein remained internalized in intracellular membranes (Figure [6](#fig6){ref-type="fig"}a).

Injection of current pulses (500 pA for 4 ms) via whole-cell patch clamp reliably induced single action potentials. We paired single action potentials with a 2 ms flash at λ~write~ = 594 nm (*I* = 200 W/cm^2^). The flash was delivered either before (Δ*t* \< 0 ms), during (0 ms \< Δ*t* \< 10 ms), or after (Δ*t* \> 10 ms) the action potential. After

Validation of the models was not reported in 27 of the papers (71%). Three models were validated based on the literature and ten models were validated based on data.

Four of the papers reported no validation, sensitivity analysis or bifurcation analysis (Table [6](#Tab6){ref-type="table"}).Table 6

By analyzing the response of the *BrGLYII* genes to the heavy metal stress, we found that the expression of *BrGLYII5*, *BrGLYII10* and *BrGLYII13* was significantly up-regulated (over 1.5-fold) under the FeD condition. *BrGLYII4*, *BrGLYII5*, *BrGLYII9*, *BrGLYII10* and *BrGLYII13* showed an up-regulation under the ZnD stress condition, whereas *BrGLYII5* showed a significant up-regulation under the ZnE stress condition. *BrGLYII11* was induced by approximately 1.5-fold under the CdE stress condition. These results illustrate the diverse responses of different *BrGLY* genes in the stress regulatory pathways in Chinese cabbage. Among the *BrGLYII* gene members, *BrGLYII5* was induced under the FeD, ZnD and ZnE stress conditions, which suggested that it may play a crucial role in heavy metal stress and its function requires further validation (**[Fig 7B](#pone.0191159.g007){ref-type="fig"}**).

To verify the response of the glyoxalase genes to heavy metals, RT-qPCR was performed to validate the nine candidate *BrGLYI* genes (*BrGLYI-1*, *2*, *3*, *4*, *5*, *6*, *8*, *11*, *15* and *16*) under the Pb and Cd treatment conditions (**[Fig 8](#pone.0191159.g008){ref-type="fig"}**). In the shoot, *BrGLYI8* were significantly up-regulated under the Cd condition and were approximately 1.8-fold higher than the expression under the control condition. The expression of *BrGLYI11* had no significant change under the Cd stress condition. Moreover, the expression of *BrGLYI3* and *BrGLYI6* showed significant increase under the Pb treatment compared with that in the control. Most interestingly, although the expression of *BrGLYI1* was almost undetected under the control conditions, its expression level was significantly induced under the Pb treatment conditions. In addition, the expression of *BrGLYI16* showed no significant difference under Cd and Pb treatments compared with control. In the root, *BrGLY

A total of 180 CHB patients were enrolled in this retrospective study, of which 89 patients were treated with LdT and 91 patients were treated with ETV according to the Taiwanese Health Insurance Guidelines. The initial selection of NA for treatment was at the physicians' discretion. Nineteen patients in the LdT group had a virological breakthrough during the 3-year treatment period, 15 patients decided to continue the treatment with self-paid medicine, and 9 patients had a viral breakthrough within 1 year after treatment following 3 years of therapy. Two patients in the ETV group changed to another NA due to headache and intent to become pregnant, 38 patients decided to continue the treatment with self-paid medicine, and 5 patients experienced viral breakthrough within 1 year after the treatment.

In total, 2 groups of 46 patients with HBV treated with LdT or ETV, respectively, were analyzed in this study (Fig. [1](#Fig1){ref-type="fig"}). The dosages and dosing interval were adjusted according to the patient's renal function. Only one patient in the ETV group modified the dosing interval every two days according to his creatinine clearance (25 mL/min), which was less than 50 mL/min.Fig. 1Flow chart of the treatment

The mean age of patients who completed 3 years of treatment with LdT and ETV were 46.3 and 51.3 years, respectively. The baseline demographic data were balanced at baseline for age, sex, comorbidity of chronic kidney disease stages, hypertension, and diabetes and prescribed with potential renal toxicity agents (Table [1](#Tab1){ref-type="table"}). There were 63% (29 of 46) and 60.1% (28 of 46) HBeAg-positive patients in the LdT-treated group and ETV-treated groups, respectively (*p* = 0.57). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were used in 2.2% of the ETV group and 8.8% in the LdT group; immunosuppressive agents were used in 2.2% of the ETV group and 2.2% in the LdT group.Table 1The demographics and change of CKD stages of 92 HBV patients assigned to be treated with LdT or ETVLdT (*n* = 46)ETV (*n* = 46)*P*-valueAge (mean ± SD

Distribution of abdominal fat is increasingly recognized as a driving force behind diabetes, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disorders. Modern cross-sectional imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), can accurately quantify the compartment-specific distribution of adipose tissue in the abdomen. Specifically, fat accumulation around intra-abdominal organs, termed visceral adipose tissue (VAT) \[[@R01]\], has emerged as a stronger correlate of metabolic risks than subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) \[[@R02], [@R03]\]. This can be explained by functional and metabolic differences between the two compartments: VAT is metabolically more active than SAT and produces inflammatory mediators contributing to chronic low-grade inflammation, increased insulin resistance and impaired lipid metabolism \[[@R04]-[@R07]\].

Although MRI/CT is the gold standard for quantifying the size of abdominal compartments, they are costly, time-consuming and labor-intensive. These factors make MRI/CT impractical for routine use and signify the need for developing a more practical (yet reasonably accurate) method to measure abdominal fat distribution. Anthropometric indices, such as waist circumference (WC) \[[@R08]-[@R10]\] and body mass index (BMI) \[[@R11], [@R12]\], are well-established predictors of morbidity and mortality and are commonly used as proxies for adiposity in the general population. However, their associations with specific abdominal compartments (i.e. SAT, VAT and total abdominal (TAb) volumes) in different ethnic backgrounds vary \[[@R13]-[@R15]\]. To date, studies investigating ethnicity-specific associations have predominantly focused on ethnic groups in the USA, with only a handful of studies investigating ethnic groups in other parts of the world. In particular, there are no published data on abdominal volumes in Maori (the indigenous people of New Zealand) and Pacific Islanders (PI) though they have a significantly greater burden of obesity than Caucasians. Further, to the best of our knowledge, abdominal fat distribution has never been assessed in adult New Zealand population using MRI.

The aims were to assess ethnicity-specific differences in abdominal volumes using MRI in a multi-ethnic New Zealand study, to investigate the associations between conventional anthropometric indices and MRI-derived abdominal volumes across the ethnicities and to derive ethnicity-specific equations to predict VAT volume.

Like in other prokaryotes, RecA in mycobacteria holds a key role in homologous recombination and was shown to be a crucial element in regulating the SOS response upon DNA damage^[@CR10],[@CR35],[@CR36]^. Thus, the observed decrease of RecA prompted us to perform a phenotypical analysis of the *Msm* Δ*pafBC* mutant strain under DNA-damaging conditions.

In the growth experiments DNA stress was emulated by exposing the bacterial cultures to the DNA interstrand crosslinking agent mitomycin C. In both, *Mtb* and *Msm*, *recA* was shown to be upregulated upon exposure to mitomycin C^[@CR5]^,^[@CR37],[@CR38]^. In an initial approach we determined the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of mitomycin C for *Msm* wild type to be 160 ng/ml and 4 ng/ml for the *pafBC* deletion strain. We subsequently performed a survival assay using 50% of the MIC for *Msm* wild type. The *Msm* wild type strain, *Msm* Δ*pafBC* and the complemented strain were grown in shaking cultures and mitomycin C was added at an OD of 0.1. After 8 h, serial dilutions of the respective cultures were spotted onto LB agar plates without mitomycin C. *Msm* wild type and the complemented strain were only mildly affected by mitomycin C, when compared to the controls grown in absence of the agent (Fig. [6A](#Fig6){ref-type="fig"}). In contrast, the number of viable cells in cultures of the *pafBC* deletion mutant decreased by about two orders of magnitude upon exposure to mitomycin C. Similar observations were made when *Msm* Δ*pafBC* was exposed to UV irradiation. After a UV dose of 25 mJ/cm^2^ viability of the deletion strain decreased by approximately two orders of magnitude as compared to the *Msm SMR5* parental strain (Fig. [6B](#Fig6){ref-type="fig"}).Figure 6Deletion of *pafBC* in *Msm* results in increased susceptibility to DNA damaging agents.

In addition to medication status, examination of Tables [1](#T1){ref-type="table"}--[5](#T5){ref-type="table"} reveals no systematic sample characteristic, parameter, or analytic approach that could be driving this review's main finding of EBC deficits in schizophrenia. Indeed, EBC deficits occur across samples of varying ages and gender composition, and in studies using a range of EBC stimulus parameters and experimental design (e.g., CS/US duration, ISI, ITI, and pre-conditioning trials or pseudoconditioning) and analysis (e.g., CR window and criterion) specifications. Furthermore, potentially confounding issues such as spontaneous blink rate and baseline blinking function have been investigated by several groups, with no convincing evidence that these variables bias EBC experimental results.

Furthermore, it appears as though many studies reporting null findings or facilitated conditioning may have parametric or analytic variations that could account for such results. Specifically, Taylor and Spence ([@B54]) used a visual delay EBC paradigm, and the diagnostic criteria for the disorder differed substantially from those used in recent decades. Furthermore, the idiosyncratic analytic approaches of other studies may account for the reported null findings. For example, rather than quantifying rate of conditioning, Stevens and colleagues ([@B59]) measured the number of trials it took for participants to reach "criterion," or five consecutive CRs. This style of analysis is not reported in most other studies. Another study appeared to restrict their analysis such that relatively less data are included compared to other studies. Specifically, O'Connor and Rawnsley ([@B55]) only used 18 unpaired CS-alone trials to measure conditioning, rather than attempting to detect CRs across all paired trials over the course of conditioning. Finally, Sears and colleagues ([@B57]) did not include a measure of spontaneous blink rate; it is therefore possible that group differences in non-associative blinking could have confounded the reported findings of facilitated conditioning in schizophrenia. More research is necessary to determine whether these varied findings are due to these methodological differences or, in fact, reflect inconsistencies in EBC deficits in schizophrenia across studies.

CR Timing {#S4-9}
---------

Group differences in timing of the conditioned response (i.e., onset and peak latency) have been reported far less frequently than rate of conditioning (i.e., percent CRs). Among studies reporting these variables, there is inconsistency in how onset latency is calculated and whether the algorithm

Clinical outcome measurements {#s0007}
-----------------------------

Clinical outcome measurements were completed preoperatively, at 3 and 6 months, and 1 and 2 years after surgery. This included the Oxford Hip Score (OHS), the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF12), a 0 (no pain) to 100 mm (maximum pain) visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain and a 0 (minimum) to 100 mm (maximum) VAS for satisfaction.

Statistics {#s0008}
----------

20 patients were included for 2-year follow-up in this exploratory study. This number of patients was selected and considered adequate to detect statistically significant differences regarding acetabular BMD changes based on earlier studies using this DXA technique (Smolders et al. [@C22], Lazarinis et al. [@C11]). 20 patients have also proven to have adequate power monitoring BMD changes after bone grafting in a different field of interest, i.e., spinal fusion (Hagenmaier et al. [@C9]). For this reason, we performed no sample size calculation for the current study. All data were checked for normal distribution by means of the Shapiro--Wilk test. Normally distributed data are presented as mean (SD). Not-normal distributed data are presented as median (range). The absolute (g/cm^2^) and relative (%) BMD changes of each ROI over the observed period and clinical scores were compared with baseline values using linear mixed models with random intercept (patient) and random slope (time). Time (categorical) and sex were treated as fixed factors. Results from the mixed model were reported with use of point estimates with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). The assumptions for this model were checked and found to be adequately met. No adjustments for multiple testing were performed. Missing data were assumed to be missing at random; residuals of the model were normally distributed. Data of patients lost to follow-up were included up to their last measurement. Differences were considered statistically significant with a p-value \<0.05. All statistical

Study procedure {#Sec5}
---------------

In the companies that we work with and in the French legal framework for preventing psychosocial risks, the occupational health service administers questionnaires to all the employees during their medical examination on a dedicated computer. One of the questionnaires is the HADS and employees have the ability to print out their scores; this means that they can discuss them immediately with the doctor.

Other questionnaires are also offered to employees but they differ from company to company: thus, some employees complete the Cohen Perceived Stress Scale \[[@CR47]\] in 10 or in 4 items and/or a questionnaire measuring psychosocial risks, the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire \[[@CR48]\]. The execution was computerized and the data collected was fully anonymous.

Once a year, usually, companies ask us for a global analysis, by type, by age, by job, etc. and we report the results to the medical and social partners. We also participate, if the company so wishes, in setting up action plans with groups of employees who obtained the lowest scores.

The employees were free to respond or not, but given the context, more than 95% responded, representing a total 20992 people who fully completed the HADS in 2011.

Statistical analysis {#Sec6}
--------------------

Exploratory Factor Analyses (EFAs) were carried out on all the participants and on several subgroups on SPSS 18.0. The rotation requested was oblique (oblimin rotation) given that the factors are correlated.

The results of the EFAs show that there are several possible factorial solutions. We tested these models with Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) conducted on Lisrel 8.8. We take as our basis the two recommended indicators \[[@CR49]\] (that are Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), and Adjusted Goodness of Fit Index (AGFI) which corrects Goodness of Fit Index (GFI) depending on the number of degrees of freedom. A good fit between the theoretical model and the data should be expressed as an RMSEA lower than .05 \[[@CR50]\], or even .08 \[[@CR51]\] the AGFI should be greater than .90 \[[@CR52]\] or even .95 \[[@CR49]\].

We then proceeded to carry out a reliability analysis by measuring the internal consistency using Cronbach\'s alpha and calculating the scale-item correlations (SPSS 18.0). We checked that the scores obtained were compatible with those of the literature by means of

The relationship between different subtypes of PTL and clinic

Anyone who has endured the pain of being unreasonably overlooked for promotion, reacted angrily in response to a below-market value offer for their house, or felt slighted by an unduly small pay raise will acknowledge that humans are highly attuned to violations in fairness. Particularly in the financial domain, we are often forced to weigh up the demands of maintaining social equity versus economic self-interest, and how we respond to such dilemmas can have marked economic, social, and personal consequences. It is therefore important to understand the psychological mechanisms that underpin how we respond to perceived unfairness.

The ultimatum game (UG) neatly models the balancing act between financial self-interest and social equity (see Guth, Schmittberger, & Schwarze, [@CR28]). On each trial, a proposer makes a once-only offer of how to divide a sum of money, and the responder either rejects or accepts the proposed division. If the offer is rejected, neither player receives any money. If the offer is accepted, the proposal is implemented. Since it is a one-off offer with no impact on reputation, the "rational" responder behavior is to accept all offers, no matter how unfair. After all, some money is better than no money. However, a proportion of unfair offers are reliably rejected, despite the fact this entails a financial loss for the responder (see, e.g., Sanfey Rilling, Aronson, Nystrom, & Cohen, [@CR46]).

One proposed explanation of this rejection behavior is a failure of emotion regulation. Emotional experience in the face of unfairness (e.g., an increase in anger, disgust, surprise, or a general sense of arousal) is believed to override the economically "rational" response of accepting whatever is offered.[1](#Fn1){ref-type="fn"} This perspective mirrors a range of work examining the causes and consequences of impaired emotion regulation (Gross, [@CR26]; for a review, see Gross, [@CR27]) and is supported by an array of data on the UG. Inducing a negative mood increases rejection rates (Harle & Sanfey, [@CR29]). Increased activity in the right anterior insula---a brain area implicated in emotion processing and experience---predicts greater rejection rates (Sanfey et al., [@CR46]). When accepting unfair offers, greater activation is seen in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex---a region associated with emotion regulation capability (Tabibnia

Sialadenosis is a rare disease entity showing diffuse, non-inflammatory, non-neoplastic enlargement of the major salivary glands. Although elucidation of the detailed etiology and pathogenesis of sialadenosis is dependent on further research, it is thought that a loss and thinning of the myofilament component of the myoepithelial cells leads to a loss of mechanical support for the acini of the salivary gland ([@B2]). This alteration at the micro-histological level allows acinar cells to expand as secretary granules accumulate in the cells, which leads to the gross change of diffuse enlargement of the salivary gland. The functionally deficient myoepithelial cells in sialadenosis may result from an autonomic neuropathy secondary to severe and long-standing metabolic or hormonal disorders such as diabetes mellitus, alcoholism (particularly with liver disease), liver cirrhosis, chronic malnutrition, and medications ([@B1]-[@B4]). Almost all cases with sialadenosis have been reported in adult patients. This exceeding rarity in children may be related to underlying diseases common in adults and also due to the probable long latent period required for the development of this condition. In our case, longstanding medications and nutritional problems may be related to the development of sialadenosis but leukemia itself has not been reported to be associated with its development. In fact, chemotherapeutic agents, such as thiouracil and valproic acid, are known to be associated with the development of sialadenosis ([@B1]). In contrast, the association between steroid treatment and the development of sialadenosis has not yet been elucidated.

For the diagnosis of sialadenosis, other disease presenting with persistent bilateral parotid swellings, including infection, autoimmune disease, granulomatous disease, kimura disease, polycystic parotid disease, iatrogenic causes, and neoplastic disease, should be excluded ([@B1], [@B5], [@B6]). Salivary glands may be rarely involved by leukemia/lymphoma and may often manifest as a painless, progressive swelling. The involvement with leukemia/lymphoma is usually associated with autoimmune disease such as Sjögren syndrome or rheumatoid arthritis ([@B6]). Although imaging findings are not pathognomonic, single or multiple salivary gland lesions with increased blood flow and sometimes with microcysts may be revealed on US, CT, or MRI ([@B4]).

For the imaging evaluation of the salivary glands, various imaging modalities including sialography, scintigraphy, US, CT, and MRI may be used. When the clinical

The path length is then calculated as C--2×B.](hyp-71-937-g001){#F1}

External Validation
-------------------

One hundred forty-eight participants of the SUMMIT study underwent WB-MRA using the same acquisition parameters and with the intra-arterial path length measured using the same technique as in the TASCFORCE cohort.^[@R14]^ This was then compared with the distance generated using the formula from the TASCFORCE cohort. PWV in this cohort was calculated using the 3 distances: the external distance (PWV~SUMM~), the true distance on MRI (PWV~TD~), and the formula distance (PWV~MRA~).

External Application
--------------------

Using the formula, PWV~MRA~ was calculated in both the SUMMIT and CaPS population. This was then compared with the PWV~SUMM~ in the SUMMIT cohort for its effects on intercenter variability and the associations between PWV and common risk factors and the PWV~CaPS~ in the CaPS population for its effects on the association between PWV and risk factors.

Statistical Analysis
--------------------

Data are expressed as mean±SD for continuous variables, median (range) for ordinal variables, and N (%) for nominal variables. Normality tests with Shapiro--Wilk were undertaken. For derivation of a path length formula within the TASCFORCE population, the influence of clinical factors on carotid--femoral path length was quantified using linear regression modeling. Sex, age, height, weight, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, glucose, smoking status, smoking years, pack years, and BMI were the starting variables within the backward entry model. To avoid overfitting, the variables were initially split into 2 blocks and backward linear regression preformed. The variables remaining in the model at the end of the backward linear regression then inserted into a third backward

Despite the notable advantages of having a positive lookout, overly positive expectations sometimes have negative consequences and lead to poorer performance. Optimistic individuals tend to underestimate potential threats and obstacles, take risks, and persist in investing in hopeless endeavors ([@B21]; [@B75]; [@B37]). Optimists, for example, are more likely than pessimists to continue gambling after losing money ([@B32]).

Optimism thus can have positive but also negative effects on performance. Here, we propose that for creative performance the positive effects of optimism are particularly likely to manifest themselves when people are avoidance motivated. When people are approach motivated, these positive effects should be less prominent, and negative effects of over-optimism are more likely to occur. It is likely that there is a negative relation between trait avoidance motivation and trait optimism. However, even when people are avoidance motivated (due to individual differences or situational cues), levels of optimism about successfully avoiding specific negative outcomes vary across situations. For example, someone may be rather optimistic about the likelihood of not failing an exam, but less optimistic about the likelihood of not getting hurt on a skiing trip. In the following, we review the psychological processes that are evoked by avoidance motivation, and discuss how optimism may reduce negative effects of these processes on creativity.

Optimism, a recipe for creativity under avoidance motivation {#s3}
============================================================

Compared to approach motivation, avoidance motivation is associated with a host of cognitive, affective, and volitional processes that can undermine creative performance (for a thorough review of these processes see [@B16]). Here we discuss why these processes influence creativity, and how optimism impacts each of these processes and may thereby mitigate negative effects of avoidance motivation.

Cognitive processes {#s3-1}
-------------------

According to*Cognitive Appraisal* theories ([@B47]) demanding tasks or situations are evaluated according to subjective perceptions of demands and available resources. When demands exceed resources, situations are evaluated as threats. However, when situations are taxing yet rewarding, they are perceived as challenges. When people are approach motivated, they tend to appraise situations in terms of challenges, whereas when they are avoidance motivated they tend to appraise situations in terms of threats. Approach motivation and the associated challenge appraisals evoke flexible and associative information processing, which enhances creativity ([@B4]; [@B35]). Avoidance motivation and the associated threat appraisals, on the other hand, evoke persistent and systematic information processing ([@B26]; [@B25]).

A domesticated pig, conversely, is likely to produce over 20 times the weight of manure \[[@B36]\], and although not all will be useable as bait, it may nonetheless vastly increase the number of traps a researcher can set. As another omnivore, pig dung may also attract a wide range of species, although to our knowledge the richness of dung beetle assemblages sampled using pig dung has not been compared against human dung. Furthermore, pigs from rural households are largely fed household waste, and so likely has a diet almost equivalent to that of a human. By contrast, industrial pigs may have a very different diet and so would not be preferable. Finally, wild suiformes (pigs and peccaries) are found across the globe and so are natural sources of dung for many forest species.

If dung beetles do show preferences for specific types of dung, then potentially a mix of two or more dung types may catch a fuller complement of the assemblage and therefore provide a more complete inventory of the dung beetles present than a single dung type. Bait mixes (as opposed to trap arrays that consist of adjacent but separate pitfalls with different baits) are rarely used (eg \[[@B37]\]) and it remains untested if they capture a wider breadth of species. Here, we examine the efficacy of pig dung and pig-human dung mixes at sampling dung beetle assemblages compared to sampling using pure human dung. Given that human baited pitfalls have been implemented in the majority of previous studies, we specifically compare the assemblages sampled by human dung with those sampled by the mixes and pig dung. A successful bait will sample both a high number of species and individuals, but also an assemblage that is comparable to that collected by human dung to allow for valid comparisons with the previous literature.

The study was carried out in the Jari region in the north-east Amazon, Pará, Brazil. Jari consists of \~65,000 ha of *Eucalyptus* plantations, \~45,000 ha of regenerating secondary forest and \~1.5 Mha of largely undisturbed primary forest.

ASK1·TIR1 complex was purified from Sf9 cells as described earlier^[@CR23]^ with minor changes. In brief, ASK1 was co-purified with GST-TIR1 using GSH affinity chromatography (gravity flow) and anion chromatography (MonoQ) followed by tag-removal and a final size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) step (Superdex 200) using an ÄKTA FPLC system.

AUX/IAA proteins, including chimeric versions, were expressed as GST-tagged proteins in *E.coli* and purified using GSH affinity chromatography, including a high-salt wash (1 M NaCl) and gravity flow anion exchange chromatography (Sepharose Q). For circular dichroism, the GST-tag was removed on the GSH column matrix with thrombin, and fractions containing AUX/IAAs were briefly concentrated, passed over a benzamidine column, and further purified using a Sephacryl S-100 column (SEC) with an ÄKTA FPLC system. This step was carried out using the CD measurement buffer (see CD measurement section) for buffer exchange.

Size exclusion chromatography and size calculations {#Sec13}
---------------------------------------------------

The last protein purification step was used to simultaneously determine the Stokes radii of AUX/IAAs in CD buffer (10 mM KPi pH 7.8; 150 mM KF; 0.2 mM TCEP). The HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-100 high-resolution column was calibrated using gel filtration standards (Bio-Rad, Cat. \#151-1901) with added bovine serum albumin (BSA) before the runs. Stokes radii for the globular known reference proteins were calculated as described^[@CR76]^. The Stokes radii of AUX/IAA variants were calculated from the resulting calibration curve equation based on their retention volume (*n* = 4--10).

Circular dichroism (CD) measurements {#Sec14}
------------------------------------

After purification, including tag-removal and size-exclusion chromatography, AUX/IAAs were concentrated and adjusted to 2.5--5 µM in CD buffer. CD measurements were carried out on a Jasco CD J-815 spectrometer and spectra were recorded from 260 nm to 185 nm as 32 accumulations using a 0.1 nm interval and 100 nm/min scanning speed. Cell length was 1 mm and temperature was set

The DUDIT has three outcome categories related to the total score: no problems (\< 6), drug abuse (6--19), and drug dependence (20+). We compared the no problem group to the other two groups.

The ISI has four outcome categories related to the total score: no significant insomnia (\< 8), subthreshold insomnia (8--14), clinical insomnia (15--21), and severe clinical insomnia (22+). We compared the participants with clinical and severe clinical insomnia groups to the participants with no or subthreshold insomnia.

The Altman mania scale has two outcome categories: no manic symptoms (\< 6) or (hypo)manic symptoms (6+). These outcome categories were compared.

The BSI judges an individual to be a potential psychiatric case with a GSI score equal to or greater than a T-score of 63. For adult non-patients this translates to a GSI score of 0.58 for men and 0.78 for women according to Appendix A of the BSI manual (Derogatis [@CR19]). Participants were assigned to two groups (psychiatric problems or not) accordingly.

These categories were analyzed using logistic regression, with user group (SC or NC) as independent variable, clinical category as dependent variable, and age and gender as covariates. Bias-corrected accelerated bootstrapping was used to produce confidence intervals.

Participants {#Sec8}
------------

The total number of responses was 589 SC users and 417 NC users. From this total, cases were removed if they did not give explicit consent, if they did not provide an age over 18 or gender, if they did not complete at least one of the questionnaires, and if they did not explicitly state they had used NC (for the NC users) or SC (for the SC users) in the past year. After removing these cases, we included 367 participants from three different countries: 238 SC users and 129 NC users (see Table [1](#Tab1){ref-type="table"}). For all analyses, cases with missing data on any measure were pairwise excluded.Table 1Participant informationSubstanceAge range (years old)Mean age (years old ± SD)WomenMenOtherSC users (*N* = 238)18--6627.6 (± 8.5)51 (21%)177 (74%)10 (4%)NC users (*N* = 129

*In Silico* Analysis of MMP-2 Regulated Promoters {#s4j}
-------------------------------------------------

Two kilobases of the proximal promoters of the twenty transcripts most up-regulated by transfection with NTT-MMP-2 were retrieved. As controls, two kilobases of twenty randomly selected, unregulated transcripts were also retrieved. The number of consensus transcription factor binding sites for IRF7, NFAT and NF-κB were determined in each promoter using the Transcription Element Search System ([www.cbil.upenn.edu/tess](http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/tess)) and the TRANSFAC v6.0 and JASPAR databases. Data are expressed as the number of transcription factor binding sites/promoter and compared using an unpaired t-test, with P\<0.05 considered significant.

Western Blot Analysis of Nuclear IRF7 and IRF1 {#s4k}

To determine if NNT-MMP2 induces IRF7 transcriptional activation through induction of IRF7 nuclear localization, as compared to control IFR1, H9C2 cells were transiently transfected for 48 hours with 200 ng/dish control pcDNA3.1 plasmid or NTT-MMP-2 pcDNA. Thereafter, H9C2 nuclei were harvested using standard methodology, followed by Western blot for IRF7 using rabbit polyclonal anti-IRF7 antibody (Abcam Ab11980) or rabbit polyclonal anti-IRF1 antibody (Abcam Ab26109). Nuclear extracts from the murine macrophage cell line RAW

[Table 6](#tbl0060){ref-type="table"} shows a solid predictability across all metal futures over all time periods. Analyzing the full sample, we find ${\overline{R}}^{2}s$ ranging from 7.46% for silver to 19.51% for platinum. By analyzing the post financialization period, we notice an improvement in the predictability for all metals, except for copper. The ${\overline{R}}^{2}s$ span from 12.49% for silver to 28.31% for gold. When differentiating between expansions and recessions, we observe a substantial improvement in return predictability, except for palladium in recessions. In particular, we find a superior performance for copper and platinum in recessions, indicated by ${\overline{R}}^{2}s$ of 79.63% and 64.62%, respectively.

*Out-of-sample results.*  Analogously to the in-sample analysis, we proceed out-of-sample similarly. In the first step, we run a kitchen sink regression to determine the variables that are significant at least the 10% significance level. Afterwards, we use a mean forecast combination approach to determine the out-of-sample forecast and the corresponding $R_{oos}^{2}$.

Following [@br0400], forecast combinations might lead to an improvement of the out-of-sample predictability. On the one hand, forecast combinations aggregate information of multiple variables, and thus, providing more stable out-of-sample forecasts by reducing the forecast volatility. On the other hand, forecast combinations incorporate information about the state of the real economy. The authors argue that mean forecast combinations provide evidence for a superior performance, despite its simplicity.[11](#fn0110){ref-type="fn"} In doing so, we compute the combined out-of-sample forecast as:$${\widehat{er}}_{t + 12}^{c,oos} = \frac{1}{M}\sum\limits_{m = 1}^{M}{\widehat{er}}_{t + 12}^{m,oos},$$ where ${\widehat{er}}_{t + 12}^{c,oos}$ is the combined out-of-sample forecast, and ${\widehat{er}}_{t + 12}^{m,oos}$ the individual out-of-sample forecast of the (at the at least 10% level significant) predictor *m*, where $m = 1,...,M$. To determine the significance of the $R_{oos}^{2}$, we use

Obesity is the major health problem worldwide and has now become one of the leading causes of death globally in both adults and children and its prevalence is continuously increasing worldwide.[@ref1] The World Health Organization recently reported that 642 million people were obese in 2014 and this statistics is on the rise globally.[@ref2] It is also documented that at least 2.6 million people die annually due to obesity worldwide.[@ref2],[@ref3] Health consequences of obesity range from risk of premature death to major health problems such as cardiovascular diseases, arthritis, diabetes, and cancer that cause significant reduction in the overall quality of individuals' life.[@ref1] Authorities from Saudi Arabia mentioned that obesity is one of the leading causes of deaths in the country.[@ref4] Forbes also listed Saudi Arabia on 29^th^ position with a percentage of 68.3% of Saudis being obese[@ref4],[@ref5] and now it is well established that it is a leading concern of the country, where 7 out of 10 Saudi citizens suffering from it.[@ref4]-[@ref6] In 2013, the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia conducted a survey on the National Health Information; the rate of obesity among Saudis in the age group of 15 years and above was found to be 28.7% whereas this rate of obesity in the schoolgoing children was 9.3% and in pre-schoolchildren this rate was 6%. As a result of these data on obesity, the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia had introduced the program on obesity control.[@ref6]

There are many reasons for the onset of obesity in humans such as excessive eating, lack of physical activities, and lack of exercise, but most importantly it is associated with individual's food of choice, which is strongly depended on individuals that how they are getting influenced by daily stress exposure.[@ref7] Scientifically, it has been now proved that prolonged stress promotes unhealthy food intake which leads to obesity and other health problems.[@ref7],[@ref8] This stress--eating relation is now become a global concern and it is very common in Saudi Arabia.[@ref7]-[@ref9] Stress can be physical or physiological in nature, which has been described previously.[@ref10],[@ref11] Stress initially activates adaptive responses, but if it is prolonged, it causes alterations in the regulatory neural network, resulting in weaken stress-related adaptive processes and increased risk of serious health problems.[@ref12] Stress-induced mechanisms affecting food intake and obesity are shown in [Figure 1](#F1){

Chromosome-based in vitro random mutagenesis was performed according to a procedure published previously \[[@B21-molecules-24-00470]\]. Briefly, error-prone PCR products were achieved by amplifying *acrB* with the Mutazym II^®^ polymerase from the GeneMorph II^®^, Random Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). Subsequently, chromosomal wild-type a*crB* of *E. coli* 3-AG100 was substituted by the mutated PCR products using a homologous recombination method (RED/ET^®^ Counter-Selection BAC Modification Kit, Gene Bridges, Heidelberg, Germany). Resulting mutants were subjected to selection with 16 mg/L CLR in the presence of 25 mg/L PAβN. Screening for stable PAβN-resistance was done by drug susceptibility assays without and with PAβN.

3.4. Sequencing {#sec3dot4-molecules-24-00470}
---------------

Whole genome sequencing was conducted according to a protocol published earlier \[[@B40-molecules-24-00470]\]. Raw sequencing data from mutants C5/1/17 and CP1 and from their parent 3-AG100 were deposited in ENA (European Nucleotide Archive) under sample accession number PRJEB30347. Variants were detected using the CLC Genomics Workbench v 8.0.2 (Qiagen, CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark) by comparing with the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) reference sequence (RefSeq) NC_000913.3 from *E. coli* K-12 substr. MG1655 (accession: PRJNA57779).

Findings were confirmed by Sanger sequencing of purified PCR products (primer given in [Table S3](#app1-molecules-24-00470){ref-type="app"}) carried out from Microsynth SEQLAB (Göttingen, Germany).

3.5. Site-Directed Reconstructions {#sec3dot5-molecules-24-00470}
----------------------------------

Site-directed reconstructions of *acrB* from mutant CP1 (*acrB*~CP1~) within strain 3-AG100 and vice versa of wild-type *acrB* (*acrB*~wt~) within CP1 were performed using the Counter-Selection BAC Modification Kit (Gene Bridges, Heidelberg)

Introduction {#sec1-1}
============

Androgens (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone) act through androgen receptor (AR) and this interaction is required for normal prostate development (Roy et al., 1999; Cunha et al., 1987). It is believed that prostatic carcinogenesis is androgen mediated, however serum androgens can't promote carcinogenesis alone, hence functional status of androgen receptor (AR) is the most important mediator of prostate cancer progression. Low serum testosterone in prostate cancer patients was found to be associated with high AR expression which in turn is linked to higher Gleason score (Schatzl et al., 2002). Recent studies also revealed that high AR expression was correlated with disease progression and lower recurrence free survival (Lee, 2003). Quantitative immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of AR has not been evaluated as a prognostic biomarker of prostate cancer in our population, therefore in the current study we aimed to evaluate the association of AR expression with various prognostic parameters like tumor quantification, gleason score, WHO grade group and perineural invasion.

Materials and Methods {#sec1-2}
=====================

Case Selection: Total 121 cases of biopsy proven prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma were selected from records of pathology department archives. All patients underwent surgeries at Liaquat National hospital, Karachi from January 2013 till December 2017 over a period of 5 years. The study was approved by research and ethical review committee of Liaquat National Hospital and informed written consent was taken from all patients at the time of surgery. Hematoxylin and eosin stained slides and paraffin blocks were retrieved and new sections were cut where necessary. Slides of all cases were reviewed by two senior histopathologists and pathologic characteristics like Gleason score, WHO grade, tumor quantification, perineural and lymphovascular invasion were evaluated. Specimens included prostatic chips and radical prostatectomies. Moreover, representative tissue blocks of all 121 cases were selected for AR immunohistochemistry (IHC).

Androgen Receptor (AR) Immunohistochemistry: AR IHC was performed using DAKO EnVision method using monoclonal mouse anti-human androgen receptor; clone AR441 according to manufacturer's protocol (dilution of 1:50). Nuclear staining for AR was both quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated. Intensity of staining was scored into no staining (0), weak (1+), intermediate (2+), strong (3+) while percentage of positively stained cells were scored as continuous variable ([figure 1](#F1){ref-type="fig"}). Intensity and percentage scores

Focused Ion Beam-Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM)
-------------------------------------------------------

Focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy was performed as described previously ([@B55]).

Statistical Analysis
--------------------

All statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 6. Normality of representative data from CFU counts (*n* = 30) and PI staining (*n* = 15) was verified by D'Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test. The different samples were compared using one-way ANOVA with *p*-values obtained from Bonferroni's multiple comparisons test.

Participants
------------

Twenty-two female and 7 male V elderly living in a vegetarian senior citizens home in the Netherlands (female: 84.1 ± 5.1yrs, male: 80.5 ± 7.5yrs) and 23 female and 7 male NV elderly living in a regular senior citizens home in the Dutch speaking part of Belgium (female: 84.3 ± 5.0yrs, male: 80.6 ± 7.3yrs) volunteered to participate in this study. All subjects were \"apparently healthy\", which was defined as free of major disease or physical handicap. In agreement with the university ethics committee, all participants received explanation about the purpose and procedures of the study and signed an informed consent statement before participating.

Measures and procedure
----------------------

Dietary intake (Food Frequency Questionnaire, FFQ), blood profile, anthropometrics, and handgrip strength were registered.

During our visit at their respective senior citizens homes, all V and NV participants completed a validated semi-quantitative 104 items FFQ \[[@B36]\] to estimate their dietary intakes over the last 6 months. A standard portion size and 9 possible food-frequency categories, ranging from never or less than 1 time per month to 6 or more times per day, were given for each food items. The FFQ was completed in the presence of the researcher, allowing clarification and help when necessary.

Blood samples were collected after an overnight fast and analysed for haemoglobin, red cell count, serum iron, transferrine, ferritine, white cells, ureum, albumin, serum calcium, serum zinc, vitamin B12, folic acid, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol in the clinical biology laboratory of the university hospital of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, following validated standard procedures.

Anthropometric variables were registered in order to determine the body mass index (BMI, kg/m^2^) and the waist-hip ratio. Additionally, triceps and subscapular skinfolds and upperarm girth were taken. The handgrip strength was measured using a hand dynamometer grip strength meter. Measurements were carried out according to standardized techniques \[[@B37],[@B38]\].

Statistical analysis
--------------------

In case of different reference values \[[@B17],[@B18]\] for men and women, males and females were analysed separately. After testing for normality (Kolmogorov Smirnov Goodness of Fit

Kim-1 and NGAL have been proposed as kidney injury markers \[[@B23],[@B24]\]. Kim-1 is a type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein with an immunoglobulin and mucin domain, and NGAL is a protein of the lipocalin family consisting of 8β-strands that form a β-barrel enclosing calyx \[[@B23],[@B24]\]. After renal injury, they are highly up-regulated in damaged renal proximal tubular cells, and can be detected in urine. The degree of renal injury is correlated with the increased urine concentration of NGAL and Kim-1 \[[@B23],[@B24],[@B47],[@B48]\]. The functions of Kim-1 and NGAL are unclear, but their relations with apoptosis have been documented \[[@B48]-[@B50]\]. According to the severity of renal damage, both the number of apoptotic cells and the expression of Kim-1 were increased, and Kim-1 was expressed in all the tubules displaying apoptotic labeling \[[@B47]\]. In addition, the up-regulation of Kim-1 and NGAL was identified in CsA-induced renal injury, suggesting that renal tubular cells are injured by CsA \[[@B51],[@B52]\]. We confirmed the reno-protective effect of BIL by the significant reduction of urine Kim-1 and the decreased tendency of urine NGAL concentration, indicating that BIL helps to prevent epithelial cell injury. Histologic improvements in arteriolopathy, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and tubular injury were found in BIL-treated rat kidneys, and these recoveries appeared to be associated with the reduction of oxidative stress, apoptosis, and tubular damage. The administration of bilirubin could be a target for protecting against the progression of renal injury, but further studies will be needed to facilitate such a potential therapy.

Conclusions
===========

We showed that the direct administration of BIL protected against CsA-induced tubular injury via inhibition of oxidative stress and apoptosis. BIL may be a protective agent against renal tubular injury, but further studies are needed to develop this potential therapy.

Deletion of the 11p15.4 region is associated with autosomal dominant hereditary persistence thalassemia (HPFH, OMIM: 141749) and autosomal recessive beta-thalassemia (OMIM: 141900) \[[@B11], [@B12]\].

We report on a preterm infant who had intrauterine growth retardation and developed hemihypertrophy during the postnatal stay. The microdeletion of 11p15.4 that was found in our case is likely to be paternally derived, since the patient\'s half-sister had an inherited anemia (family history). The additional features (abnormal physical findings) in our patient have not been previously reported with deletion of the 11p15.4 region. Microdeletions of 11p15 are rare. There have been limited reports of patients with interstitial deletions involving band 11p15.4. To our knowledge none have reported clinical features in a neonate with the same deletion as in our case. Here, we provide additional human genetic evidence that the 11p15.4 deletion contains regulatory elements that play a mechanistic role in the hemihypertrophy BWS phenotype and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR).*It remains unclear what exactly is the relation between this deletion and the BWS/hemihypertrophy associated genes.*

In summary, we report a novel case of a dysmorphic preterm neonate with*microdeletion* 11p15.4. These findings may help identify the gene implicated in BWS and IUGR.
