The map of Fig. \[fig:2\] shows significant sub-structure, in particular within the 1$\sigma$ boundaries of the central dominant stellar aggregate. This structuring behavior indicates hierarchy. The minimum spanning tree (MST) of the young stars in the whole region allows to determine the statistical  parameter, introduced by [@cw04]. This parameter is a measure of the fractal dimension $D$ of a stellar group, permitting to distinguish between centrally concentrated clusters and hierarchical clusters with fractal substructure. The application of the MST to our data shows that the region NGC 346/N66 is highly hierarchical with a  that corresponds to a fractal dimension $D \simeq 2.5$.

Constructing surface stellar density maps allows us to further characterize the clustering behavior of stars with the application of tools, which are originally designed for the study of the structuring of the interstellar medium (ISM), as observed at far-infrared or longer wavelengths. The so-called [*dendrograms*]{} are used for the visualization of hierarchy through structural trees [@rosolowsky08]. The dendrogram of the stellar density map of NGC 346 demonstrates that the observed hierarchy is mostly due to the substructure in the dominant stellar aggregate. The $\Delta$-variance analysis [@stutzki98; @ossenkopf08] is a robust structure analysis method that measures the amount of structure on a given scale $l$. In principle the $\Delta$-variance is directly related to the power spectrum of the map, and thus for a power law spectrum of index $-\beta$, $\Delta$-variance also follows a power law, $\displaystyle 
\sigma_\Delta^2 \propto l^\alpha$, with $\alpha={\beta-2}$. The application of the $\Delta$-variance analysis on the surface stellar density map of NGC 346 verifies that indeed the clustering of the young stars in the region is self-similar (Fig. \[fig:3\]), with a spectral index $\beta \simeq 2.8$, corresponding to a fractal dimension $D=2.6$ of the corresponding fractional Brownian motion structure [@stutzki98], similar to that previously derived for Galactic molecular clouds. Self-similarity appears to brake, i.e., we find different hierarchical properties for the short-range scaling and the behavior at the overall scale of the region, at length-scales $l \geq 25$px, corresponding to physical scales of $\sim$40(

From the light curves (Fig. 1), we can see that the X-ray and TeV variabilities of Mrk 421 are roughly correlated, although they are clearly not always in step. Figure 5 shows the X-ray and gamma-ray count rates for all simultaneous measurements. Although a positive correlation between the rates seems apparent, it is only a loose one. We should note that the dynamical range of the data is quite large ($\sim$30 in both energy bands) which is important for studying correlative variability of the source.

To be more rigorous, we computed the Z-transformed discrete correlation function (ZDCF; Alexander 1997) from light curves in the two bands. The ZDCF makes use of the Fisher’s z-transform of the correlation coefficient (see Alexander 1997 for a detailed description). Its main advantage over the more commonly used DCF (Edelson & Krolik 1988) is that it is more efficient in detecting any correlation present. Figure 6 shows the ZDCF (in 1-day bins) derived from the 2002/2003 data set. The ZDCF seems to peak at a negative lag. Fitting the peak (in the narrow range of -7–7 days) with a Gaussian function, we found its centroid at $-1.8 \pm 0.4$ days, which is of marginal significance. If real, the result would imply that the X-ray variability [*leads*]{} the gamma-ray variability. Other ZDCF peaks are most likely caused by the [*Whipple*]{} observing pattern, such as the quasi-periodic occurrences of the dark moon periods. Similarly, we computed a ZDCF for the 2003/2004 data set. The results are shown in Figure 7. In this case, the main feature is very broad and significantly skewed toward [*positive*]{} lags. The feature appears to be a composite of multiple peaks, although large error bars preclude a definitive conclusion. A positive ZDCF peak means that the X-ray emission [*lags*]{} behind the gamma-ray emission. We checked the results with different binning schemes and found no significant changes.

The detection of X-ray [*lags*]{} in the 2003/2004 data set should not come as a total surprise, because we have already seen (from Fig. 2) that the X-ray flux rose more slowly than the gamma-ray flux during the 2004 giant flare. The difference in the rise times can be the cause of the broad ZD

In our experiment we observed a suppression of the lasing linewidth to sub-kilohertz in comparison with the cold cavity linewidth of the resonator (sub-megahertz). This can be equivalently described by an improvement of the resonator’s $Q$ by a factor of $10^3$ due to active lasing. In order to verify these results, we modeled our ring laser setup analytically following and extending the approach by Wang [@wang_causal_2002]. We modeled the filtering mechanism due to the WGM resonator and implemented this model in an iterative numerical simulation, taking into account gain saturation. The experimentally observed characteristics could be reproduced by appropriate choice of parameters, the most crucial being the fiber cavity’s and the WGM resonator’s $Q$ factors and the saturated intracavity power. The laser’s emission spectrum narrows with increasing intracavity power. This outcome agrees well with a fully analytic approach by Eichhorn et al. [@Eichhorn12]. Our simulation does not cover further aspects regarding the WGM resonator’s instability due to an increased lasing power, and is therefore not able to determine the optimal intracavity power.

Recent measurements of ZnCu$_{3}$(OH)$_{6}$Cl$_{2}$ with bulk magnetic susceptibility, $\chi_{bulk}$[@Helton], specific heat[@Helton], neutron scattering on powders[@Helton], $\mu$SR[@Ofer; @Mendels], and $^{35}$Cl NMR[@Ofer] have established that ZnCu$_{3}$(OH)$_{6}$Cl$_{2}$ remains paramagnetic down to at least $\sim50~mK$ with no evidence of magnetic long range order. These findings indeed point towards the possible realization of a frustrated spin liquid state with the Kagomé symmetry. However, very little is known beyond the paramagnetic nature of the ground state. For example, the bulk averaged susceptibility, $\chi_{bulk}$, reveals a mysterious sharp [*increase*]{} below $\sim 50$ K [@Helton]. This clearly contradicts the predictions of various theoretical calculations: series expansions predict a [*decrease*]{} of $\chi_{bulk}$ below $T\sim J/6$ with a gap[@Elstner; @Mila], while the recent Dirac Fermion model predicts linear behavior in $T$ towards $T=0$ [@Lee]. Does this apparent contradiction mean that ZnCu$_{3}$(OH)$_{6}$Cl$_{2}$ is not a good Kagomé model system after all, or that extrinsic effects other than Kagomé Heisenberg interaction, such as mixing of Zn ($S=0$) into Cu ($S=\frac{1}{2}$) sites[@Vries; @Bert] and Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) interactions[@Singh1; @Singh2], simply mask the intrinsic Kagomé behavior below $\sim 50~K$? What about spin dynamics? Do spin fluctuations slow down toward a critical point, or are they gapped [@Elstner; @Mila; @Lee]?

Towards this purpose, we develop the LSZ approach for Moyal spacetimes. The latter gives a formula for scattering amplitudes on these spacetimes which can be obtained from the corresponding ones on the commutative spacetime. This formula applies in the presence of spontaneous breakdown of symmetries as well. We also derive Goldstone’s theorem on Moyal spacetime.

    Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking In Twisted Noncommutative Quantum Theories

Introduction
============

Spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry involves a subtle interplay between an infinite number of degrees of freedom, local and spacetime symmetries, dimension of spacetime, and the notion of (non-)locality of interaction. Naturally one would suspect that the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) leads to different physics in the context of quantum field theories on the Groenewold-Moyal (GM) plane, when the idea of locality is altered, albeit in a very precise sense: pointwise multiplication of two functions is replaced by [*star*]{}-multiplication, which is no longer commutative, and is in addition non-local. New phases and soliton solutions appear making the dynamics richer[@gubser; @stripe; @trg1; @trg2].

Writing quantum field theories on such spaces requires some care, if one wishes to discuss questions related to Poincaré invariance. To give up this spacetime symmetry almost entirely (which is what conventional quantization does) seems too heavy a price, as it affects the notion of identity of particles (“of two identical particles in one frame should describe two identical particles in [*all*]{} reference frames”), and leads to unacceptable coupling between UV- and IR- degrees of freedom as well[@minwalla]. The program of twisted quantization initiated in [@bmpv; @replyto] on the the other hand, avoids these pitfalls: Poincaré invariance can be maintained, a generalized notion

Figure \[figa2\] shows a schematic of a collision between a ball and a bat, where a ball at the time $t$ is going to collide with the bat. When the first condition of collision (see section III.C) is fulfilled, the ball has penetrated into the bat at the time $t + \Delta t$. Thus, we put the ball back to the previous position at the time $t$ to determine the remaining time $\Delta t^{'}$ before collision. From the condition that the distance between the center of the bat and the center of the ball at the time $t + \Delta t^{'}$ equals to the sum of the radius of the bat and that of the ball, we obtain a quadratic equation for $\Delta t^{'}$. Here we assume that the ball travels linearly with a constant velocity during $\Delta t^{'}$ to simplify the calculation. Among the two solutions for the quadratic equation, we choose the positive one for $\Delta t^{'}$ which has a physical meaning.

From the position of the ball at the time $t + \Delta t^{'}$, we can calculate all the variables such as ${\bf n}$, $\tilde{\bf r}$, ${\bf V}_{b}$ and $\tilde{e}$ in Eq. (\[collision\]). The ball reflects from the bat according to the following algorithm. First, we put the ball back to the position at the time $t$. Next, we apply the half of the averaged force to the ball during $2 \Delta t$ so that the impulse from the bat becomes constant. With this two-step time evolution, the ball bounces from the bat without penetration.

It is important to emphasize that the manifold $M_k$ has $n+1$ commuting holomorphic Killing vectors (i.e. $n+1$-dimensional torus $T^{n+1}$ acts on $M_k$; corresponding transformations of $M_k$ are holomorphic and preserve the metric). This means that we can apply the machinery of $T$-duality to the $\sigma$-model with target space $M_k$; one can conjecture that $T$-duality is related to mirror symmetry in this situation. To describe the above mentioned action of $T^{n+1}$ on $M_k$ we represent a point of $T^{n+1}$ as a row $\sigma =(\sigma
_1,...,\sigma_{n+1},\sigma _{n+2})$ where $|\sigma_i|=1,\sigma_1...\sigma
_{n+2}=1$. Every point $\sigma \in T^{n+1}$ determines a transformation of $M_k$, sending $(z_1,...,z_{n+1},\theta)$ into $(\sigma
_1z_1,...,\sigma _{n+1}z_{n+1},\sigma _{n+2}\theta)$. It is easy to check that this transformation is holomorphic and isometric.

One can obtain an essential generalization of the above construction using the notion of toric supermanifold.

Let us consider an $(m|n)$-dimensional complex linear superspace ${\bf C}^{m|n}$ with the standard Kähler metric $ds^2=\sum _{a=1}^{m+n}
d\bar {z}_a\cdot dz_a$. (We denote coordinates in ${\bf C}^{m|n}$ by $z_1,...,z_{m+n}$. The coordinates $z_1,...,z_m$ are even, the coordinates $z_{m+1},...,z_{m+n}$ are odd.) Poisson brackets of functions $\varphi _1=\bar {z}_1z_1,...,\varphi _{m+n}=\bar {z}_{m+n}z_{m+n}$ vanish; therefore corresponding hamiltonian vector fields generate an action of $(m+n)$-dimensional torus $T^{m+n}$ on ${\bf C}^{m|n}$. Let us consider functions $\psi _i=\sum _{k=1}^{m+n} a_{ik}\varphi _k,\  1\leq

\[lemma23\] For ${\operatorname{Re}}(s)>1$ and $\beta \in {\mathbb{N}}$ one has $$\sum_{q = 1}^\infty  {\frac{{c_q^{(\beta )}(n)}}{{{q^{\beta s}}}}}  = \frac{{\sigma _{1 - s }^{(\beta )}(n)}}{{\zeta (\beta s)}}.$$

From Lemma \[lemma22\] one has the following bound $$|c_q^{(\beta )}(n)| \leqslant \sum_{\substack{d|q \\ {d^\beta }|n}} {{d^\beta }}  \leqslant \sum_{{d^\beta }|n} {{d^\beta }}  = \sigma_1^{(\beta )}(n).$$ Suppose $x$ is a fixed non-integer. Let us now consider the positively oriented path $\mathcal{C}$ made up of the line segments $[c-iT,c+iT,-2N-1+iT,-2N-1-iT]$ where $T$ is not the ordinate of a non-trivial zero. We set $a_q = c_q^{(\beta)}(n)$ and we use the lemma in $\mathsection$3.12 of [@titchmarsh] to see that we can take $\psi(q) = \sigma_1^{(\beta)}(n)$. We note that for $\sigma > 1$ we have $$\sum_{q = 1}^\infty  {\frac{{|c_q^{(\beta )}(n)|}}{{{q^\sigma }}}}  \leqslant \sigma_1^{(\beta)} (n)\sum_{q = 1}^\infty  {\frac{1}{{{q^\sigma }}}}  = \sigma_1^{(\beta)} (n)\zeta (\sigma ) \ll {\frac{1}{{\sigma  - 1}}}$$ so that $\alpha=1$. Moreover, if in that lemma we put $s=0$, $c=1+1/\log x$ and $w$ replaced by $s$, then we obtain $$\mathfrak{C}_0^{(\beta )}(n,x) = \frac{1}{{2\pi i}}\int_{c - iT}^{c + iT} {\frac{{\sigma_{1 - s/\beta }^{(\beta )}(n)}}{{\zeta (s)}}\frac{{{x^s}}}{s}ds} + E_{1,T}(x),$$ where $E_{1,T

Next, we need to generalize Eckart dissipative thermodynamics to the case when also chemical diffusion, (lepton diffusion in this case) is present. Therefore, we need to consider the lepton conservation equation (n Y\_eu\^+ n Y\_(u\^+n\^))\_[;]{}=0, where $n^{\alpha}$ is the neutrino four–velocity with respect to the frame comoving with matter (see [@Thorne], [@IS]), with $n^{\mu}u_{\mu}=0$ and $n^{\mu}n_{\mu}=1$. Defining the neutrino flux as $f^{\alpha}=n Y_{\nu}n^{\alpha}$, that satisfies $u_{\alpha}f^{\alpha}=0\,$, and using the continuity equation (\[cont\]) we obtain the equation of lepton conservation $n u^{\alpha} (Y_L)_{,\alpha}=-f^{\beta}_{\,\,;\beta}$. This latter equation is particularized for lepton diffusion, which is relevant for nascent neutron stars, but it is a general conservation equation for massless particles. Therefore, the set of equations we have is the following:

-   Continuity equation: (nu\^)\_[;]{}=0.

-   Energy conservation equation (stress-energy tensor projected onto $u$): u\^\_[,]{}+u\^\_[ ;]{}(+p)+q\^\_[ ;]{} +q\^u\^u\_[;]{}=0.

-   First law of thermodynamics: d=dn+nTds+n\_ dY\_L.\[newfirst\]

-   Lepton conservation: nu\^Y\_[L,]{}=-f\^\_[ ;]{}.\[Ydot\]

Together they give: nTu\^s\_[,]{}=-q\^\_[ ;]{}+\_ f\^\_[ ;]{} -q\^u\^u\_[;]{} .\[sdot\] Let us now define the entropy flux as in [@Israel], S\^=snu\^+-\_. Notice that when degenerate neutrinos dominate the transport of energy and particles, $q_\alpha=\mu_{\nu} f_\alpha$ and there is no entropy flux. By taking the divergence of the entropy flux, we have TS\^\_[ ;]{}= -(D\_T+Tu\^u\_[;]{}) -f\^TD\_ , where we have defined $\eta\equiv\frac{\mu_{\nu}}{T}$. The second law of thermodynamics, $

Finally, we turn to the apparent variations in the planet’s phase curve. From Figure \[fig:planet-phase-curve-var\_Analysis\_of\_Kepler76b\], variations in $A_{\rm cos}$ and $A_{\rm sin}$ amount to variations of about 40% in $A_{\rm planet}$ around a median value of $50.5 \pm 1.3$ ppm. Meanwhile, $\delta$ has a median value of $-9^\circ \pm 1.3^\circ$ (an offset east of the sub-stellar point) and swings between about $-40^\circ$ (an eastward offset) and $+20^\circ$ (a westward offset). Figure \[fig:Aplanet-delta-var\_Analysis\_of\_Kepler76b\] shows the range of $A_{\rm planet}$- and $\delta$-values, along with a linear fit which incorporated the per-point uncertainties in $A_{\rm planet}$ and $\delta$ [@boggs1990orthogonal].

The Kepler-76 system closely resembles the HAT-P-7 system – both have hot ($>$ 6,000 K) stars hosting large ($>$ 1 ${\rm M_{Jup}}$) short-period planets with observed [[*Kepler*]{}]{} secondary eclipses indicating dayside brightness temperatures $>$ 2,700 K. As discussed in Section \[sec:Introduction\], @2016NatAs...1E...4A applied a model similar to ours, searching for changes in the planet’s phase curve, finding statistically significant fluctuations in $\delta$ between about $6^\circ$ eastward and $9^\circ$ westward of the substellar point over timescales of tens to hundreds of days. That study then applied a model involving atmospheric transport of aerosols and found good qualitative agreement between the model and their observational results. Our results are qualitatively similar, although with much larger apparent swings in $\delta$. In addition, we were able to detect statistically significant variations in the planet’s phase curve amplitude, while @2016NatAs...1E...4A did not.

Discussion and Conclusions {#sec:Discussion}
==========================

As discussed in @2016ApJ...828...22P, the phase curve offset for an eclipsing planet arises, in part, from the competition between thermal emission from the hottest regions and reflection from highly refractive cloud regions on the dayside. Although the daysides of hot Jupiters like Kepler

Limit theorem {#sec:limit_th}
=============

In this section, we present a limit theorem of the QW as $t\to\infty$ by using the Fourier analysis which is one of the standard methods to derive limit theorems of the QWs [@Konno2010; @Machida2011; @InuiKonnoSegawa2005; @InuiKonno2005; @SegawaKonno2008; @KonnoMachida2010; @ChisakiKonnoSegawaShikano2011; @GrimmettJansonScudo2004]. The long-time limit theorem plays an essential role to draw asymptotic behavior of the QW after many steps. The time evolution of the QW provides the Fourier transform $\ket{\hat{\Psi}_{t}(k)}=\sum_{x\in\mathbb{Z}} e^{-ikx}\ket{\psi_t(x)}\,(k\in\left[-\pi,\pi\right))$, the relation $\ket{\hat{\Psi}_{t+1}(k)}= \hat U(k)\ket{\hat{\Psi}_{t}(k)}=\hat U(k)^t \ket{\hat\Psi_{0}(k)}$ , where $\hat U(k)=(e^{ik}\ket{0}\bra{0}+e^{-ik}\ket{1}\bra{1})U$. After straightforward calculation by the Fourier analysis, for $r=0,1,2,\ldots$, we get $$\begin{aligned}
 \lim_{t\to\infty}\mathbb{E}\biggl[\biggl(\frac{X_t}{t}\biggr)^r\biggr]=&\int_{0}^{\pi} \frac{dk}{2\pi} h(k)^r\,\biggl[\biggl\{\left|\braket{v(k)|\hat\Psi_0(k)}\right|^2+\left|\braket{v(-k)|\hat\Psi_0(-k)}\right|^2\biggr\}\nonumber\\
 &+(-1)^r\biggl\{\left|\braket{\overline{v(\pi-k)}|\hat\Psi_0(k)}\right|^2+\left|\braket{\overline{v(\pi+k)}|\hat\Psi_0(-k)}\right|^2\biggr\}\biggr],\end{aligned}$$ where $$\begin{aligned}
 h(k)=&\frac{c\cos k}{\sqrt{

Stellar clusters are known as good ‘laboratories’ for studying member stars. By fitting isochrones, one can obtain distance, age and sometimes get information on metallicity of a cluster. Our project is focused on finding open clusters rich in pulsating B-type stars and subsequent seismic modeling of their members by means of ensemble asteroseismology (hereafter EnsA). EnsA takes advantage of the common parameters of the members of a cluster (e.g. age and metallicity) to put additional constraints on seismic models of member stars. It is applicable to open clusters rich in massive pulsating stars. The most promising are $\beta$ Cep stars for which many interesting results were already obtained by means of seismic modeling [e.g. @Aerts2003; @Pam2004; @Dup2004; @Dasz2010]. One of the best candidates for application of EnsA is NGC6910 [@Kol2004], for which pulsation parameters were obtained as a result of the international observational campaign [@Pig2008; @Sae2010]. In the era of nano-satellites, new possibilities of seismic studies of stars belonging to bright, nearby star clusters occured. An example is $\alpha$ Per open cluster.

New observations and results
============================

The results of the observations of NGC457 and preliminary results of the search for variable stars in IC1805 were published by [@Moz2014] and [@Moz2012], respectively. Recently, we performed also search for variable stars in another young open cluster, IC4996. Observations of IC4996 were made between 2007 and 2014 in Bia[ł]{}ków Observatory (Poland) during 50 observing nights. The observations were carried out with a 60-cm reflecting telescope with the attached CCD camera covering $13^\prime\times12^\prime$ field of view. About 7500 CCD frames were acquired through the $B$, $V$, $R$, $I_{\rm C}$ and narrow-band H$\alpha$ filters. We detected 81 variable stars (Fig. \[VarCMD\]), of which 71 are new. One new $\beta$ Cep star was found.

In total, in three open clusters (NGC457, IC1805, and IC4996) we have detected 231 variables. Among the most

A direct experimental determination of the phase-space density $d=
\langle n \rangle/(2R\Delta)^3$ in high energy collisions is not easy. The sources created in such collisions feature strong collective expansion [@Pratt95; @He96], and therefore only small fractions of the total collision region (so-called regions of homogeneity) contribute effectively to the two-particle correlator [@He96]. This means that in the parametrization (\[21\]) we should use $R^2 = R_{\rm hom}^2 + 1/(4\Delta^2)$ where $R_{\rm hom}$ is the (pair momentum dependent) homogeneity radius which, in the absence of strong multi-pion effects, is equal to the HBT radius parameter $R_{\rm
  HBT}$. Without more detailed model studies it is then, however, unclear what fraction of the total observed multiplicity $\langle n
\rangle$ comes from a single such homogeneity region.

On the other hand Fig. 3 suggests that, within our model class of event ensembles, the ratio ${\langle n\rangle^2 \over \langle
  n(n-1)\rangle}$ is a useful indicator for the average phase-space density $d$ in the source and thereby also for the expected multi-pion symmetrization effects on the 1- and 2-particle spectra which need to be taken into account in an extraction of the source size from HBT measurements.

In the experiment one usually fits the two-particle correlator with the functional form $$C^{\rm exp}(\bbox{p}_1,\bbox{p}_2) = 
   C^{\rm exp}(\bbox{q,K}) = 
   {\cal N} \left( 1{+}\lambda |f(\bbox{q,K})|^2\right) ,$$ where the function $f$ vanishes as $\bbox{q}\to \infty$. Obviously, ${\cal N}$ depends on the chosen definition of the correlation function: For the definition (\[I\]) the normalization is always ${\cal N}^{I}=1$ (see Eq. (\[17\])), while for the definition (\[II\]) it is ${\cal N}^{II} = {\langle n\rangle^2 \over \langle
  n(n-1)\rangle}$ (see Eq. (\[18\])). But in both cases ${\cal N}$ is well-defined and thus should not be treated as a free

#### Realizing set

By computing the [Fréchet distance]{} using the modified Alt and Godau algorithm, we obtain an ordered, potentially non-minimal realizing set $\mathcal{E} = \{ e_1, \ldots, e_l \}$. The algorithm must find an event that is contained in a realizing set. Let $E_{k}$ denote the first $k$ events of $\mathcal{E}$. For now we assume that the events in $\mathcal{E}$ end at different cell boundaries. We use a binary search on $\mathcal{E}$ to find the $r$ such that $E_r$ contains a realizing set, but $E_{r-1}$ does not. This implies that event $e_r$ is contained in a realizing set and can be used to split the curves. Note that $r$ is unique due to monotonicity. For correctness, the order of events in $\mathcal{E}$ must be consistent in different iterations, for example, by using a lexicographic order. Set $E_r$ contains only realizing sets that use $e_r$. Hence, $E_{r-1}$ contains a realizing set to connect cell $(1,1)$ to $e_r$ and $e_r$ to cell $(m,n)$. Thus any event found in subsequent iterations is part of $E_{r-1}$ and of a realizing set with $e_r$.

To determine whether some $E_{k}$ contains a realizing set, we check whether cells $(1,1)$ and $(m,n)$ are connected without “using” the events of $\mathcal{E} \backslash E_{k}$. To do this efficiently, we further modify the Alt and Godau algorithm. We require only a method to prevent events in $\mathcal{E} \backslash E_{k}$ from being used. After $L^R_{i,j}$ is computed, we check whether the event $e$ (if any) that ends at the left boundary of cell $(i,j)$ is part of $\mathcal{E} \backslash E_{k}$ and necessary to obtain $L^R_{i,j}$. If this is the case, we replace $

Orbital dynamics of double pulsars in SME {#sec:model}
=========================================

When the pure-gravity sector of the minimal SME is considered, it will cause secular evolutions of the orbits of double pulsars. Since timing observations of double pulsars could obtain its value very precisely, the periastron advance plays a much more important role in constraining $\bar{s}^{\mu\nu}$ and, with widely used notations in celestial mechanics, it reads [@Bailey2006] $$\begin{aligned}
  \label{domegadtsme}
  \bigg<\frac{d\omega}{dt}\bigg>\bigg|_{\mathrm{SME}} & = & -\frac{n}{\tan i (1-e^2)^{1/2}}\bigg[\frac{\varepsilon}{e^2}\bar{s}_{kP}\sin\omega+\frac{(e^2-\varepsilon)}{e^2}\bar{s}_{kQ}\cos\omega-\frac{\delta m}{M}\frac{2na\varepsilon}{e}\bar{s}_k\cos\omega\bigg]\nonumber\\
  & & -n\bigg[\frac{(e^2-2\varepsilon)}{2e^4}(\bar{s}_{PP}-\bar{s}_{QQ})+\frac{\delta m}{M}\frac{2na(e^2-\varepsilon)}{e^3(1-e^2)^{1/2}}\bar{s}_Q\bigg],\end{aligned}$$ where $M = m_1+m_2$, $\delta m = m_2-m_1$ ($m_2>m_1$) and $\varepsilon  =  1-(1-e^2)^{1/2}$. In this expression, the coefficients $\bar{s}_{\cdot}$ and $\bar{s}_{\cdot\cdot}$ for Lorentz violation with subscripts $P$, $Q$ and $k$ are projections of $\bar{s}^{\mu\nu}$ along the unit vectors $\bm{P}$, $\bm{Q}$ and $\bm{k}$. The unit vector $\bm{k}$ is perpendicular to the orbital plane of the binary pulsars, $\bm{P}$ points from the focus to the periastron, and $\bm{Q}=\bm{k}\times\bm{P}$. By definitions [@Bailey2006], $\bar{s}_k\equiv \bar{s}^{0

As we have shown earlier [@Khar98], such uncorrelated behavior of $R_s(H_{r\!f})$ and $X_s(H_{r\!f})$, as we observed for our samples (Fig. \[fig1\]), cannot be explained by any of the known theoretical models, including Josephson vortices [@Halb97] (where $r_{JF}<1$, $\Delta R_s$,$\Delta X_s\sim H_{r\!f}^n$, $0.5<n<2$), heating of weak links [@Golos95] ($r_{HE}<1$, $\Delta R_s,\Delta X_s\sim H^2$) and the RSJ model [@Halb97] ($r_{RSJ}<1$, $\Delta R_s$ increasing in a stepwise manner and $\Delta X_s$ oscillating with $H_{r\!f}$), intrinsic pair breaking or uniform heating [@Golos95] (for both mechanisms $r<10^{-2}$, and $\Delta R_s,\Delta X_s\sim H^2$). We can also rule out the mechanism of the superconductivity stimulation by microwave radiation [@Eliash], recently claimed by us [@Khar98] and Choudhury et al. [@Choudh97]. In this mechanism, the dc magnetic field decreases the order parameter, increasing both $R_s$ and $X_s$, which we do not observe for any of our samples. Moreover, we see that even in the low-power regime $H_{dc}$ can cause reduction of both $\Delta R_s$ and $\Delta X_s$, which is not explained by the above model at all.

The most plausible mechanism responsible for the decrease in $R_s$ and $X_s$ with both $H_{r\!f}$ and $H_{dc}$ fields seems to be field-induced alignment of the spins of magnetic impurities, which are likely to be present in most HTS (particularly in YBaCuO) [@Kres1]. This mechanism was recently claimed by Hein et al. [@Hein97] to explain their results on non-monotonic behavior of $R_s$ and $X_s$ in $H_{dc}$ and $H_{r\!f}$ for YBaCuO thin films.

In general, conventional ranking models (e.g. BM25) rely on a manually designed ranking function and require heuristic optimization for parameters [@Liu2009; @Chapelle2011]. In the age of information explosion, this one-size-fits-all solution is no longer adequate. For instance, it is well known that links to a web page are an important source of information in web document search [@Brin1998], hence using the link information as well as the relevance between a query and a document is crucial for better ranking. In this regard, learning to rank [@Liu2009] has drawn much attention as a scheme to learn how to combine diverse features. Given feature vectors of documents and their relevance levels, a learning to rank approach learns an optimal way of weighting and combining multiple features.

We argue that the single scores (or features) produced by BM25 and our proposed semantic measure complement each other, thus merging these two has a synergistic effect. To confirm this, we measured the impact on document ranking by combining BM25 and semantic scores using the learning to rank approach, LamdaMART [@Burges2008; @Burges2010]. Trained on PubMed user queries and their click-through data, we evaluated the search performance based on the most highly ranked 20 documents. As a result, we found that using our semantic measure further improved the performance of BM25.

Taken together, we make the following important contributions in this work. First, to the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first investigation of query-document similarity for information retrieval using the recently proposed Word Mover’s Distance. Second, we modify the original Word Mover’s Distance algorithm so that it is computationally less expensive and thus more practical and scalable for real-world search scenarios (e.g. biomedical literature search). Third, we measure the actual impact of neural word embeddings in PubMed by utilizing user queries and relevance information derived from click-through data. Finally, on TREC and PubMed datasets, our proposed method achieves stronger performance than BM25.

Methods
=======

A common approach to computing similarity between texts (e.g. phrases, sentences or documents) is to take a centroid of word embeddings, and evaluate an inner product or cosine similarity between centroids[^1] [@Nalisnick2016; @Furnas1988]. This has found use in classification and clustering because they seek an overall topic of each document. However, taking a simple centroid is not a good approximator for calculating

@even09 require the choosing of two boundary points for the donor star, each on the line of centers between the stars and on opposite sides of the donor. For our initial model, instead of fixing the boundary point closest to the accretor in space, we define it to be the L1 Lagrange point. This sets $\Psi_0$ for the accretor to $\Psi_{L1} + h\left[0\right]$, where $\Psi_{L1}$ is the effective potential at the L1 point. This ensures the donor Roche lobe is filled. The donor WD is taken to be 100 % helium. For hybrid accretor models, the core is taken to contain an evenly distributed mixture of equal parts of carbon and oxygen, while the envelope is 100 % helium. The non-hybrid accretor contains equal parts carbon and oxygen throughout.

Because the discretization used for the initial conditions and the discretization that results from writing the time invariant version of the semi-discrete evolution equations are not exactly the same, the initial model is not in exact equilibrium when it begins evolving. As a result, the outer edges of each star diffuse slightly at the very beginning of the simulation. In the case of the donor, this causes Roche lobe overflow, leading to mass transfer.

SPH code
--------

Smoothed particle hydrodynamic (SPH) merger calculations were carried out in SNSPH [@fryer06]. The code contains a highly scalable hashed oct-tree data structure [@warren95] to support efficient neighbor finding and is coupled with a multipole expansion to calculate the gravitational potential and was run with a traditional SPH scheme with the cold WD EOS and standard ($\alpha = 2, \beta = 1$) artificial viscosity parameters.

Our SPH simulations contain the same initial data as the grid-based calculations, being generated from the self-consistent-field (SCF) code. Initial particle distributions were prepared with the method in @diehl15 which converts cylindrical grid-based data into a particle representation and iteratively re-arranges particles to recover a distribution reminiscent of Weighted Voronoi Tessellation (WVT) initial conditions. Setups for each pair of stars contained $\sim 20$M particles of nearly equal mass[^2]. Each star in the WD binary system was subsequently allowed to relax individually for a short period of time prior to the merger calculation to prevent stellar oscillations and premature WD heating.

Merger calculations were run on 256 cores and required approximately

Let $G$ be a non-abelian $p$-valuable abelian-by-procyclic group with principal subgroup $H$, and let $C$ be a closed subgroup of $G$. Then $C$ is abelian-by-procyclic.

Furthermore, if $N$ is a closed, isolated normal subgroup of $G$, then $\frac{G}{N}$ is $p$-valuable, abelian-by-procyclic.

Let $H':=C\cap H$, then clearly $H'$ is a closed, isolated, abelian normal subgroup of $C$.\
Now, $\frac{C}{H'}=\frac{C}{H\cap C}\cong\frac{CH}{H}\leq\frac{G}{H}\cong\mathbb{Z}_p$, hence $\frac{C}{H'}$ is isomorphic to a closed subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_p$, i.e. it is isomorphic to either 0 or $\mathbb{Z}_p$.\
If $\frac{C}{H'}=0$ then $C=H'=H\cap C$ so $C\subseteq H$. Hence $C$ is abelian, and therefore abelian-by-procyclic.\
If $\frac{C}{H'}\cong\mathbb{Z}_p$ then $C$ is abelian-by-procyclic by definition.\
For $N\trianglelefteq_o^i G$, it follows from [@Lazard [slowromancap4@]{}.3.4.2] that $\frac{G}{N}$ is $p$-valuable, and clearly $\frac{HN}{N}$ is a closed, abelian normal subgroup of $G$.\
Consider the natural surjection of groups $\mathbb{Z}_p\cong\frac{G}{H}\twoheadrightarrow{}\frac{G}{HN}\cong\frac{G/N}{HN/N}$:\
If the kernel of this map is zero, then it is an isomorphism, so $\frac{G/N}{HN/N}\cong\mathbb{Z}_p$, so $\frac{G}{N}$ is abelian-by-procyclic by definition.\
If the kernel is non-zero, then $\frac{G}{HN}$ is a non-trivial quotient of $\mathbb{Z}_p$, and hence is finite, giving that $HN$ is open in $G$. So $\frac{HN}{N}$ is abelian

Theoretical model
=================

To represent numerically the interaction between the laser and the metallic target, we used a 1D Lagrangian hydrodynamic code [@Delpor]. Solving the Helmholtz wave equation permitted us to determine the electromagnetic field through the region illuminated by the laser. The deposited energy is then deduced using the Joule-Lenz law. A precise result for the absorption from an arbitrary medium can be obtained from the direct solution of the equation for the electromagnetic field. Let us consider a planar wave propagating along z axis. We write the following Helmholtz equation for the complex amplitude of the electric field $E_{z}$ with frequency $\omega$ : $$\label{three}
\Delta E_{z}-\nabla\nabla E_{z}+\left(1+i\frac{4\pi}{\omega}\sigma\left(T,\rho\right)\right)\frac{\omega^{2}}{c^{2}}E_{z}=0$$ where $\sigma(T,\rho)$ is the complex conductivity and $c$ is the light speed. The function $\sigma$ is calculated as a function of the density $\rho(z)$ and the temperature $T(z)$. The relative permittivity of the medium is supposed to be equal to the unity in the case of a metal target. These simulations need accurate data such as transport coefficients in solids, liquids, vapors and dense or diluted plasmas, specially refractive indices [@Palik], electric and thermal conductivities [@Ebeling], and mechanical properties such as material strength. The evolution of the irradiated target is governed by the fluid hydrodynamic and heat diffusion equations connected with a multi-phase equation of state (EOS). Thermodynamic functions that realistically describe characteristics of metal properties in various parts of phase diagram are needed. A such set of different metal EOS is generated by means of a numerical tool developped by the authors of the reference [@EOS]. As an illustration of the EOS used, displays isobars in the phase diagram temperature-specific energy of the copper for a wide range of pressure. Such data reveal the dependence on the thermodynamic properties of the melting and vaporisation processes.

The mechanical propagation of shock waves and fracture are also simulated. Elastoplasticity is described by a strain rate independent model (relevant to high strain rate conditions at high pressure, typically beyond ) which accounts for pressure, temperature and strain dependent yield strength and shear modulus [@SCG]. Laser induced stresses are the combination of the hydro

Along with the optical extinction in their directions, the detection of extended emission from the PWNe is complicated by the high level of background in nIR observations as well as the generally high density of field sources in the Galactic plane which contaminate the background. Deep nIR images from larger telescopes better able to resolve field sources, may be able to detect PWN emission, as well as increasing the probability of detecting the compact sources, but in these directions source confusion will always be a major impediment to detection of point or extended sources.

Conclusions {#section:conclusions}
===========

We find no evidence of any extended nIR emission associated with the PWNe in any of the fields or any new counterparts to the X-ray point sources, but we do confirm the magnitude of the previously suggested counterpart of [IGRJ18490$-$0000]{}. While there is a low probability of chance coincidence of the X-ray position with a nIR object in this field, the candidate source is significantly brighter than most other isolated pulsars and brighter than a simple extrapolation of the X-ray spectra to the nIR, making its association with the X-ray source less certain. If future observations can confirm the association it seems that an additional emission component will be necessary to explain the excess nIR flux. The non-detection of the other two sources, [IGRJ14003$-$6326]{} and [HESSJ1632$-$478]{}, may be understood by the high level of Galactic extinction in their direction and by the intrinsically faint nature of isolated neutron stars, which the compact objects are assumed to be; it may be reasonable to expect the counterparts of these sources to be at magnitudes $K_s \gtrsim 18.6$.

We prove now that the sequence $\{\iota_n, \iota_n\vee\iota_{n-1},\ldots,
\iota_n\vee\cdots\vee\iota_2,\top\}$ is a maximal chain, denoted $C_\pi$. It suffices to prove that $\iota_n\vee\iota_{n-1}\vee\cdots\vee\iota_k\succ
\iota_n\vee\iota_{n-1}\vee\cdots\vee\iota_{k+1}$, $k=1,\ldots,n-1$. The fact that the former is greater or equal to the latter is obvious, hence $C_\pi$ is a chain. To prove that it is maximal, we have to show that equality cannot occur among any two subsequent elements. To see this, observe that at each step $k$: $$\label{eq:proof}
\iota_k\not\leq m_k,\quad \iota_k\leq m_{k-1},\iota_k\leq
m_{k-2},\ldots,\iota_k\leq m_1.$$ Hence $\iota_{k-1}\not\leq \iota_k$, otherwise $\iota_{k-1}\leq m_{k-1}$ would hold, a contradiction. Hence, the sequence $\iota_n,\iota_{n-1},\ldots,\iota_1$ is non decreasing, and equality cannot occur.

Let us prove that it suffices to choose $\iota_k$ as the smallest in $\eta(n(j_{k-1})\setminus \eta(n(j_k))$. If at step $k$, a smallest $\iota_k$ is not chosen in $\eta(n(j_{k-1})\setminus \eta(n(j_k))$, it will be taken after, and the sequence $\iota_n,\iota_{n-1},\ldots,\iota_1$ will be no more non decreasing, a contradiction.

It remains to prove that $\pi$ is strictly increasing and to verify the expression of $m$. Let us prove by induction that $$\label{eq:pi1}
\pi(j_k)=1-m(\iota_n)-m(\iota_n\vee\iota_{n-1}) - \cdots-
m(\iota_n\vee\cdots\vee \iota_{k+1}),\quad k=n,\ldots,

Preliminaries {#sec:prelim}
=============

Notation
--------

We consider ${\mathbb{R}}^n$ with the usual inner product $\left\langle \cdot, \cdot \right\rangle$ and 2-norm $\| \cdot \|$. We use ${\mathbb{R}}^n_{\geq 0}$ for the non-negative orthant. The closed (open) unit ball of appropriate dimension is denoted by ${\mathbb{B}}$ ($\operatorname{int}{\mathbb{B}}$). For a sequence $\{K_n \}$, $K_n \rightarrow 0^+$ implies that that $K_n > 0$ for all $n$ and ${\lim}_{n \rightarrow \infty} K_n = 0$. For a map $F: {\mathbb{R}}^n \rightarrow {\mathbb{R}}^m$, differentiable at $x \in {\mathbb{R}}^n$, $\nabla F(x) \in {\mathbb{R}}^{m \times n}$ denotes the *Jacobian of $F$ at $x$*. Given a set ${\mathcal{C}}\subset {\mathbb{R}}^n$, its *closure*, *boundary*, and *(closed) convex hull* are denoted by $\operatorname{cl}{{\mathcal{C}}}$, $\partial {\mathcal{C}}$, and $\operatorname{co}{{\mathcal{C}}}$ ($\operatorname{\overline{co}}{\mathcal{C}}$), respectively. If ${\mathcal{C}}$ is non-empty, we write $\| {\mathcal{C}}\| := \sup_{v \in {\mathcal{C}}}  \| v \|$. The *distance to ${\mathcal{C}}$* is defined as $d_{\mathcal{C}}(x) := \inf_{\tilde{x} \in {\mathcal{C}}} \| x - \tilde{x} \|$, and the *projection* $P_{\mathcal{C}}: {\mathbb{R}}^n \rightrightarrows {\mathcal{C}}$ is given by $P_{\mathcal{C}}(x) := \{ \tilde{x} \in {\mathcal{C}}\, | \, \| x - \tilde{x} \| = d_{{\mathcal{C}}}(x) \}$. The *domain* of a set-valued map $H: {\mathbb{R}}^n \rightrightarrows {\mathbb{R}}^m$ is defined as $\operatorname{dom}H := \{ x \, | \, H(x) \neq \emptyset \}$. We use the

Let us be a bit more concrete. Given our ring of $N$ $d$-dimensional quantum systems, $L\le N$ and a subspace $S$ of ${{\mathbb{C}}^d}^{\otimes L}$, we denote $H_S=\sum_{i=1}^N\tau^i(h_S)$, where $h_S$ is the projection onto $S^{\perp}$ [^2]. If we start with a MPS $|\psi{\rangle}=\sum_{i_1,\ldots,i_N}\operatorname{tr}(A_{i_1}\cdots
A_{i_N})|i_1\cdots i_N{\rangle}$ with property C1, we will consider $L>L_0$ and, as before, the subspace ${\mathcal{G}}_L^A$ (or simply ${\mathcal{G}}_L$) formed by the elements $\sum_{i_1,\ldots,i_L}\operatorname{tr}(XA_{i_1}\cdots
A_{i_L})|i_1\cdots i_L{\rangle}$. It is clear that $H_{{\mathcal{G}}_L}|\psi{\rangle}=0$ and that $H_{{\mathcal{G}}_L}$ is frustration free. Moreover, if $N\ge 2L_0$ and $L>L_0$, then

\[uniqueGS\] $|\psi{\rangle}$ is the only ground state of $H_{{\mathcal{G}}_L}$.

[[**Proof.**]{} Reasoning as in the case of OBC one can easily see that any ground state $|\phi{\rangle}$ of $H_{{\mathcal{G}}_L}$ is in ${{\mathcal{G}}}_N$, that is, has the form $|\phi{\rangle}=\sum_{i_1,\ldots,i_{N}}\operatorname{tr}(XA_{i_1}\cdots
A_{i_{N}})|i_1\cdots i_{N}{\rangle}$. Since there is no distinguished first position, $|\phi{\rangle}$ can also be written $$|\phi{\rangle}=\sum_{i_1,\ldots,i_{N}}\operatorname{tr}(A_{i_1}\cdots
A_{i_{L_0}}YA_{i_{L_0+1}}\cdots A_{i_{N}})|i_1\cdots i_{N}{\rangle}.$$ By condition C1, $XA_{i_1}\cdots A_{i_{L_

The emergence of long-range temporal correlations is a non-trivial feature that can be used to test models of the Earth’s climate  [@govindan]. The understanding of the long-range temporal correlations is fundamental because they characterize the interaction among the different climate components  [@fraedrich]. There is some controversy with respect to the description made by large scale models of the atmospheric temperature variability  [@fraedrich; @vyushin; @comment; @reply; @kurnaz]. The purpose of the present Letter is to introduce a conceptual stochastic model for the fluctuations of the Earth’s atmospheric temperature, or more precisely, its radiated energy (for a survey on conceptual climate models see, for instance, Imkeller and Monahan  [@imkeller]). It will be shown that the model displays qualitative features that closely resemble observations. In contrast with other simple stochastic models of atmospheric temperature fluctuations, like autoregressive models  [@kiraly; @caballero], all the parameters of the presented model have direct physical interpretation. Additionally, as it will be discussed below, the model introduced here also reveals statistical features that are reminiscent of recent observations on the spatial structure of the climate network. Therefore, this work is intended to be a contribution towards the construction of realistic and unexpensive algorithms for Earth’s climate simulation.

The model is based on energy balance  [@cushman]. On Earth, as in other planets with a solid crust, the influx of solar radiation is balanced by the outflow from the surface and the atmosphere. In the simplest description of this process, the Earth is treated as a single point. Let us denote by $y$ and $x$ the global averages of the radiation emitted by the atmosphere and by the surface (oceans and land), respectively. A fraction of the Sun’s total radiation is immediately reflected back into space and another is absorbed by the atmosphere. The remainder of the flux is transmitted through the atmosphere and reaches the surface, which in turn absorbs some of the radiation and reflects the rest. The radiation absorbed by the surface is then radiated back as heat. The surface radiates the absorbed energy in the infrared (IR) region of the spectra. It turns out that the atmosphere is not transparent to IR radiation, essentialy due to the presence of the so-called greenhouse gases. Let us denote by $a$ the fraction of IR radiation absorbed by the atmosphere. A fraction $b$ of the total radiation absorbed by the atmosphere

The size of EWP’s is relevant to the extraction of $\alpha$ via the analysis proposed in [@GL]. Let us study this effect in detail. This analysis requires measuring the (time-integrated) rates of $B^+\to\pi^+\pi^0$, $B^0\to\pi^+\pi^-$, $B^0\to\pi^0\pi^0$ and their CP-conjugate counterparts, and observing the time-dependence of $B^0(t)\to\pi^+\pi^-$. The amplitudes of these six processes form two triangles, as shown in Fig. \[isoanalysis\], in which the CP-conjugate amplitudes have been rotated by a common phase $\tilde{A}(\bar
B\to\pi\pi)\equiv {\rm exp}(2i\gamma)A(\bar B\to\pi\pi)$ (and similarly for $\tilde{P}_{EW}$ and $\tilde{P}_{EW}^C$). The CKM phase $\alpha$ is measured from the time-dependent rate of $B^0(t)\to\pi^+\pi^-$, which involves a term (2+)(mt) , where $\Delta m$ is the neutral $B$ mass difference. The angle $\theta$ is measured as shown in Fig. \[isoanalysis\].

The effect of the EWP amplitudes on determining $\theta$ and correspondingly fixing $\alpha$ is rather clearly represented by the small vectors at the right bottom corner of the Fig. \[isoanalysis\]. These terms, given by $(c_u-c_d)(P_{EW}+P_{EW}^C)$ and its CP-conjugate, have unknown phases relative to the $T+C$ term which dominates $A(B^+\to\pi^+\pi^0)$ and its charge-conjugate. This leads to a very small uncertainty in the relative orientation of the two triangles. \[In the limit of neglecting EWP amplitudes, one would have $\tilde{A}(B^-\to\pi^-\pi^0)=A(B^+\to\pi^+\pi^0)$\]. The uncertainty in measuring $\theta$, and consequently in determining $\alpha$, is given by  . We therefore conclude that the effects of EWP amplitudes on the measurement of $\alpha$ are at most of order $\lambda^2$ and are negligible.

Since a different conclusion has been claimed in [@DH; @Desh

In this section, we prove Theorems \[thm3\] and \[thm4\]. The two sides of and are rational integers, hence it suffices to show, for every rational prime $p$, that the exponent of $p$ is at least as large on the left hand side as on the right hand side (with the convention that the $p$-exponent of zero is infinity).

We fix $p$ and an embedding ${\overline{{\mathbb{Q}}}}\hookrightarrow{\overline{{\mathbb{Q}}_p}}$, then we can think of the elements of $\Sigma$ as the embeddings $\sigma:k\hookrightarrow{\overline{{\mathbb{Q}}_p}}$. For each $\sigma\in\Sigma$, there is a unique prime ideal ${\mathfrak{p}}\mid p$ and a unique ${\mathbb{Q}}_p$-linear extension $\tilde\sigma:k_{\mathfrak{p}}\hookrightarrow{\overline{{\mathbb{Q}}_p}}$ of $\sigma$. Denoting by $I_{\mathfrak{p}}$ the set of $\sigma$’s corresponding to a given ${\mathfrak{p}}$, the extension map $\sigma\mapsto\tilde\sigma$ is a bijection $I_{\mathfrak{p}}\overset{\sim}\to\operatorname{Hom}_{{\mathbb{Q}}_p}(k_{\mathfrak{p}},{\overline{{\mathbb{Q}}_p}})$ with inverse being the restriction map. In particular, $I_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is a $\operatorname{Gal}({\overline{{\mathbb{Q}}_p}}/{\mathbb{Q}}_p)$-orbit on $\Sigma$ of cardinality $[k_{\mathfrak{p}}:{\mathbb{Q}}_p]=e_{\mathfrak{p}}f_{\mathfrak{p}}$. Let $v_p$ be the unique additive valuation on ${\overline{{\mathbb{Q}}_p}}$ extending the normalized additive valuation on ${\mathbb{Q}}_p$, and let $v_{\mathfrak{p}}$ be the normalized additive valuation on $k_{\mathfrak{p}}$. By “normalized” we mean that $v_p({\mathbb{Q}}_p^\times)={\mathbb{Z}}$ and $v_{\mathfrak{p}}(k_{\mathfrak{p}}^\times)={\mathbb{Z}}$. Then we have the important identity $$\label{eq11}
v_p(\tilde\sigma(x))=\frac{1}{e_{\mathfrak{p}}}v_{\mathfrak{p}}(x),\qquad\tilde\sigma\in\operatorname{Hom}_{{\mathbb{Q}}_p}(k_{\mathfrak{p}},{\

title: The broadband emission properties of AGN jets
---

Introduction
============

Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are among the most energetic objects in the Universe. AGN dominate the extragalactic high-energy sky, and are very active at all wavelengths from radio to $\gamma$-rays. According to the unified model of AGN, it is believed that a super massive black hole is located in the center of host galaxy, and it fuels the whole system with matter accreted around the central engine. In the radio-loud scheme, an energetic jet is launched in the vicinity of the central engine following the warped magnetic field from the pole direction of the accretion disk. Blazars[^1] are AGN whose jets are pointing toward us, and dominate the radio and the high-energy sky. After the beginning of operations of the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on-board the *Fermi* $\gamma$-ray Space telescope in mid 2008, *Fermi*/LAT detected 709 AGN in the first 11 months, and 85% of them being blazars [@abdo10a]. The high-energy emission location in blazar systems is not yet well-understood. By using the very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) technique, we are able to resolve jet structure and trace component ejection at milli-arcsecond scales [@lister09]. Combining the VLBI with the high-energy observatories (e.g., *Fermi*/LAT), we might be able to probe the location of the high-energy emission.

The **M**

In (\[E:x2\]), the receive signal $\mathbf{y}_p$ by $N_r$ additional FD receive antennas of the PBS are forwarded via $\mathbf{W}_f$. The forwarded signal will occupy a part of transmit power of the PBS, which leads to the reduction of the transmit power for desired signals. As will be clear later, however, the forwarded signal can be used to mitigate the cross-tier ICI at PUEs efficiently with the optimized $\mathbf{W}_f$, and hence result in the improvement of PUEs’ data rate.

With (\[E:yp\]) and (\[E:x2\]) we can calculate the transmit power of the FD PBS as $$\label{E:Pout-new}
    P_{out} \!=\! \mathtt{tr}(\boldsymbol{\Phi}_x) \!=\! \mathtt{tr}\big(\mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{s}_M, s_{p,k}, \mathbf{n}_p, \mathbf{z}_x,\mathbf{z}_y, \mathbf{E}_{PP},\mathbf{H}_{PP}}\{\mathbf{x}_p[t]\mathbf{x}_p^H[t]\}\big),$$ where the expectations are taken over data $\mathbf{s}_M$ and $s_{p,k}$, noises $\mathbf{n}_p$, transmitter and receiver distortions $\mathbf{z}_x$ and $\mathbf{z}_y$, channel estimation errors $\mathbf{E}_{PP}$, and self-interference channel $\mathbf{H}_{PP}$, respectively.[^2]

Assume that $\mathbf{H}_{PP}$ follows Rayleigh distribution, i.e., $\mathtt{vec}(\mathbf{H}_{PP})\sim\mathcal{CN}(\bar{\mathbf{0}}_{N_rN_t}, \bar{\alpha}_{PP}\mathbf{I}_{N_rN_t})$ with $\bar{\alpha}_{PP}$ denoting the average channel gain, which is reasonable because the transmit antennas and the FD receive antennas can be well isolated in the considered scenario as will be detailed in Section \[S:SIC\]. Then, we show in Appendix \[A:Pout\] that the transmit power $P_{out}$ can be expressed as $$\begin{aligned}
\label{E:x22}
  P_{out} \approx & \mathtt{tr}\left(\mathbf{W}_f\bar{\

Next, we treat a very useful covering trick, which is essentially due to Yujiro Kawamata. We will use it in the proof of Theorem \[x-thm9.3\].

\[x-lem3.3\] Let $f:V\to W$ be a projective surjective morphism between smooth quasi-projective varieties and let $H$ be a Cartier divisor on $W$. Let $d$ be an arbitrary positive integer. Then we can take a finite flat morphism $\tau:W'\to W$ from a smooth quasi-projective variety $W'$ and a Cartier divisor $H'$ on $W'$ such that $\tau^*H\sim dH'$ and that $V'=V\times _W W'$ is a smooth quasi-projective variety with $\omega_{V'/W'}=\rho^*\omega_{V/W}$, where $\rho:V'\to V$. By construction, we may assume that $\tau:W'\to W$ is Galois.

We take general very ample Cartier divisors $D_1$ and $D_2$ with the following properties.

-   $H\sim D_1-D_2$,

-   $D_1$, $D_2$, $f^*D_1$, and $f^*D_2$ are smooth,

-   $D_1$ and $D_2$ have no common components, and

-   ${{\operatorname{Supp}}}(D_1+D_2)$ and ${{\operatorname{Supp}}}(f^*D_1+f^*D_2)$ are simple normal crossing divisors.

We take a finite flat cover due to Kawamata with respect to $W$ and $D_1+D_2$. Then we obtain $\tau:W'\to W$ and $H'$ such that $\tau^*H\sim dH'$. By the construction of the above Kawamata cover $\tau:W'\to W$, we may assume that the ramification locus $\Sigma$ of $\tau$ in $W$ is a general simple normal crossing divisor. This means that $f^*P$ is a smooth divisor for any irreducible component $P$ of $\Sigma$ and that $f^*\Sigma$ is a simple normal crossing divisor on $V$. In this situation, we can easily check that $V'=V\times _WW'$ is a smooth quasi-projective

To verify that the truncated system numerically investigated here really represents (up to a certain time) the real, infinite–dimensional, model, we plotted in Fig.\[fig3\] $n_{eff}$ as a function of the number $N$ of field oscillators taken into account. We found that, at any fixed time, $n_{eff}$ converges on increasing $N$, its limit value giving the number of overall normal modes significantly excited in the infinite–dimensional system. As this value increases with time, an equilibrium state is never reached.

In summary, our numerical experiments have exposed a chaotic dynamics in the unusual case of an [*infinite*]{} dimensional, conservative system with a [*finite*]{} total energy. The dependence of time-averages on initial conditions gets lost, and, for any finite–dimensional reduction, the system reaches an equilibrium state, with equipartition of energy among the degrees of freedom of the field and of the matter.

From our results we infer that, in the real infinite–dimensional problem, there is a trend towards equipartition, the finite energy of matter being removed to higher and higher frequencies of the field. However, this process takes place at a nonuniform rate, as relaxation times of normal modes increase with their frequency. Therefore, as in an old hypothesis of Jeans[@JEANS], a real equilibrium state is never reached.

Artificial though it may appear, our model is actually [*the simplest, one-dim. model*]{} with charged particles undergoing elastic collisions inside a reflecting enclosure. We believe that more realistic models displaying the same basic features will display a similar behaviour. We also submit that quantization of this, or similar, field models may open a challenging new direction in the field of Quantum Chaos, starting from a very old problem.

An example of the density profile during a typical SGPE evolution is shown in Fig. \[fig:sim\_data\](a). The noisy density pattern reveals the fluctuating thermal modes in the low energy region, and is similar to the typical results of SGPE evolution in the case of contact interactions (e.g. see Fig. 2 of [@Davis2002a]). However, for this dipolar simulation in the metastable regime, we eventually find that a density spike emerges \[see Fig. \[fig:sim\_data\](b)\], which persists in the field. It is useful to define the instantaneous peak density of the field $$n_{\mathrm{peak}}(t)=\max_{\boldsymbol{\rho}}\left\{|\Psi(\boldsymbol{\rho},t)|^2\right\},$$ i.e. as the maximum density occurring at any grid point. In Fig. \[fig:sim\_data\](c) we quantify the behaviour of $n_{\mathrm{peak}}$ in the evolution leading up to the density spike forming: this formation is clearly revealed by the sudden onset of rapid growth of $n_{\mathrm{peak}}$ at $t\approx45/\omega_z$. To put these values of peak density into context, in Fig. \[fig:sim\_data\](d) we show the probability density function for values of density occurring in the field. This is obtained by making a histogram of the density values occurring at every grid point using the field sampled at a discrete set of times prior to the collapse. This density distribution revels that the most likely density is $\sim4/l_z^2 = n_0$. The thermal fluctuations in the field give rise to the spread in the distribution function around the most likely value, and we emphasize that the spike formation proceeds through values that are out in the tails of this distribution \[as indicated in Fig. \[fig:sim\_data\](d)\].

The time it takes for a spike to form is stochastic and can vary significantly between different SGPE simulations for identical parameters. Spike formation times tend to get shorter the closer the system is to the roton instability boundary and as the temperature increases. Once formed, the spikes grow rapidly as shown in Fig. \[fig:sim\_data\](c). Overall these qualitative observations are consistent with the spikes occurring as a thermally activated crossing of the energy barrier consistent with our simple model of Sec. \[Sec:model\].

Consider a CO of mass $M_{co}$ in the core of a cluster containing $N_{*}$ single stars (for a discussion of binaries, see below). A tidal disruption will take place if the distance of closest approach between this CO and a star is less than the tidal radius $R_{{\rm t}}$. If all the ordinary stars had a mass $M_{*}$, the tidal disruption rate from the one CO would be $$\dot{p}_{co}(R_{t},\sigma)=2\pi G(M_{co}+M_{*})N_{*}R_{t}\sigma^{-1}V_{c}^{-1}$$ where $\sigma$ is the relative velocity dispersion and the core volume $V_{{\rm c}}$ can be written in terms of the core radius $R_{{\rm c}}$ of the GC as $V_{{\rm c}}=4\pi R_{{\rm c}}^{3}/3$. Here we are assuming that the collision cross section is dominated by gravitational focusing. The total disruption rate in a single GC is then $$\Gamma_{co}\approx\dot{p}_{co}N_{co}\approx\dot{p}_{co}n_{0}f_{co}V_{{\rm c}},$$ where $N_{co}$ is the total number of COs in the GC core, $n_{0}$ is the number density of stars in the core, and $f_{co}$ is the fraction of COs in the stellar population (see [@1992ApJ...396..587D]).

Typical GC cores have densities of $n_{0}\simeq10^{5}\:{\rm pc}^{-3}$, and a typical core radius $R_{c}=1\:{\rm pc}$ [@pry+93; @gne+97]. Typical velocity dispersions in GC cores are roughly $\sigma\simeq20\:{\rm km\:s}^{-1}$ (see e.g. @1992ApJ...396..587D). The fraction of COs in the stellar population is taken to be $f_{{\rm NS}}=0.017$ and $f_{{\rm BH}}=0.012$ (taking a Salpeter mass function between $0.6-120$ ${\rm M_{\odot}}$ ; NSs are assumed to originate from stars of mass between $8-15$ ${\rm M_{\odot}}$ and BHs are assume to originate from stars more massive than $15$ ${\rm M_{\odot}}$); however, due to NS natal kicks and binary heating of BH

Generalized torsion elements
----------------------------

\[lem:rel\] In $G$, $[a,b\bar{a}b^{n-1}\bar{a}b]=1$.

The relation of (\[eq:p\]) gives $U a^b = a^{\bar{b}} U$, where $U=a \bar{b} ^{n-1} a$. Hence we have $U^b a^{b^2}=aU^b$, so $a=a^{b^2 \bar{U}^b}$. This gives $[a,b^2\bar{U}^b]=1$, which yields the conclusion.

\[lem:decomp\] Let $w(\bar{a},b)$ be a word containing only $\bar{a}$ and $b$. Then the commutator $[a,w(\bar{a},b)]$ can be expressed as a product of conjugates of the commutator $[a,b]$.

In general, we have an equation $[a,uv]=[a,v][a,u]^v$. Since $[a,\bar{a}]=1$, $[a,w(\bar{a},b)]$ is decomposed into a product of conjugates of only $[a,b]$.

\[thm:pretzel\] If $n\ge 1$, then $G$ admits a generalized torsion element.

By Lemma \[lem:decomp\], $[a,b\bar{a}b^{n-1}\bar{a}b]$ is expressed as a product of conjugates of $[a,b]$ if $n\ge 1$. We know that $[a,b]\ne 1$ in $G$, because $G$ is not abelian. (The only knots and links whose groups are abelian are the unknot and the Hopf link.) Then Lemma \[lem:rel\] implies that $[a,b]$ is a generalized torsion element in $G$.

When $n=0$, then link $L$ is the connected sum of the trefoil and the Hopf link. Since the knot group of the trefoil contains a generalized torsion element, so does $G$. For $n<0$, our argument in the proof of Theorem \[thm:pretzel\] does not work.

**Proof of Theorem \[thm:main1\].** This follows from Theorems \[thm:w\] and \[thm:pretzel\] and Corollary

Introduction
============

In classical electrodynamics it is well known that accelerated charges loose energy by radiation and there is a large amount of literature concerning effective equations which include effects due to radiation damping without giving a completely relativistic description of the system of fields and charges.

A similar but more involved situation occurs in the theory of general relativity where accelerated matter emits gravitational radiation and is thus damped. The probably best studied example is the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar consisting of a strongly self-gravitating system of two stars rotating about their common center of mass. Due to the difficulties as the non-linearity and the necessity of finding appropriate coodinates it seems to be out of reach to treat a system like the one already mentioned within the full theory. Hence, it is desirable to have effective equations valid in certain limits as in the electromagnetic case.

In many applications, as e.g. the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar, the occurring velocities are small compared to the speed of light. Thus, it is a natural strategy to expand the metric in powers of $|v/c|$, ($c$ denotes the velocity of light). The contribution in order zero corresponds to the non-relativistic limit where gravity is governed by Newtonian theory. Therefore, higher order corrections are usually addressed as post-Newtonian approximations. For an overview concerning post-Newtonian expansions see [@bla]. Whereas it is relatively straightforward to establish relations between the full system and the equations of approximation, it is much more difficult to give the relation between the solutions of the two sets of equations. While order zero is done in [@ADR] for asymptotically flat solutions any further progress seems to be difficult at this point.

For this reason it seems to be useful to investigate the very similar but less involved system of charged matter coupled to electromagnetic fields. In [@KS1] and [@KS2] the first post-Newtonian approximations of the Abraham model, a model consisting of single charged particles coupled to the Maxwell fields which they create collectively, are considered yielding the Darwin corrections, order $|v/c|^2$, and radiation corrections, order $|v/c|^3$ with respect to the Newtonian limit. Explicit estimates of the error terms are given.

In the present paper we choose a model of many particles governed by a statistical approach. For sake of simplicity we assume that there are only two different species of matter with mass normalized to unity and charge normalized to plus unity and minus unity, respectively. These distributions of the

In Sec. \[dge\] we shall see how the dependence on $m$ and $N$ through the combination $N\bar{\Lambda}/m$ follows from the large–order behaviour of the perturbative expansion in the large–$\beta_0$ limit. Having established Eq. (\[large-m-and-N\]) non-perturbatively, we know that this is indeed the leading behaviour at large $N$ and that corrections to this behaviour are suppressed by a power of $1/N$.

We see that the scale which characterizes the fragmentation process in the large $z$ region is $m(1-z)$ or, in moment space, $m/N$. This scale has a clear meaning when considering the bremsstrahlung off a heavy quark. Let us examine the emission in a frame where the quark energy $E$ is much larger than its mass. The radiation pattern (to ${\cal O}(\alpha_s)$) is $$\frac{dD}{dz\,d\sin^2\theta}\simeq\frac{C_F\,
\alpha_s}{\pi}\,\frac{1}{1-z}\,\frac{\sin^2\theta}{(\sin^2\theta+m^2/E^2)^2},
\label{rad_pattern}$$ where only the leading term in the limit $z\longrightarrow 1$ was kept and the angle of emission $\theta$ is related to the gluon transverse momentum by $\sin^2\theta={k_{\perp}^2}/\left({E^2z^2(1-z)^2}\right)$. As discussed in [@Dokshitzer:fd], the radiation vanishes in the exact forward direction, but it peaks close to the forward direction at $\theta\,\simeq\, m/E$ (the ‘dead cone’), or in a boost-invariant formulation at $\vert k_{\perp}\vert \simeq m(1-z)$. So $m(1-z)$ is the typical transverse momentum of radiated gluons. The scaling law (\[large-m-and-N\]) can be understood in physical terms as the observation that the hadronization effects ($\tilde{D}(N,m^2)$ at large $N$ and $m$) are dominated by interaction with gluons of transverse momentum $\bar{\Lambda}=M-m$.

Factorization {#fact}
=============

Factorization is based on the fact that dynamical processes taking place on

The first direct radio detection with low frequency Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GRMT) observations and discussion of the “green peas” properties comprising properties of a new class of sub-mJy sources were reported by @C12. It was shown that this detection may imply large magnetic fields ( $ \gtrsim 30 \,
\mu $G) in “green peas” under reasonable assumption about cosmic ray diffusion and total energy consideration. @C12 concluded that seed fields were amplified significantly (up to $\mu$G) because of turbulence as protogalactic and similar structures formed.

Detailed examination of a large sample of 803 star-forming luminous compact galaxies (LCGs) in the redshift range $z$ = 0.02 - 0.63 was carried out by @I11. These galaxies were selected from the SDSS Data Release 7 (DR7) [@A09] and comprise a complete spectroscopic SDSS sample of strongly star-forming LCGs with reliably derived chemical abundances. Their global properties are similar to those of the star-forming “green pea” galaxies. However, in contrast to “green pea” galaxies, the LCGs are selected on the base of the both their spectroscopic and photometric properties. Applied selection results in a $\sim$ 10 times larger sample, with galaxies spanning a redshift range about $\sim$ 2 times larger as compared to “green pea” sample [@C09]. For LCGs, the oxygen abundances 12 + log O/H are found to be in the range 7.6 - 8.4 with the median value of $\sim$ 8.11 confirming the results by @A10 for a subset of the “green pea” sample of @C09. The ranges of oxygen abundances and heavy element abundance ratios in LCGs are similar to those of nearby low-metallicity BCDs. In the \[O [iii]{}\]$\lambda$5007/H$\beta$ vs. \[N [ii]{}\]$\lambda$6583/H$\alpha$ diagnostic diagram [@K03] the LCGs are shown to occupy the region of high-excitation star-forming galaxies. The SFRs, derived from the H$\alpha$ line emission in the LCGs are revealed to vary in the large range of 0.7 - 60 $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, with a median value of $\sim$ 4 $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ which is about 3 times lower as compared to

Emission Line Measurements {#emission-lines}
--------------------------

The emission lines of interest were fitted with <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">sherpa</span> [@SHERPA], a general-purpose fitting environment designed for CIAO, the Chandra (X-Ray Observatory) Interactive Analysis of Observations software package [@CIAO]. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">sherpa</span> can handle multi-component models (Fig. \[sherpa\]) such as emission lines with broad components (e.g., Seyfert 1 galaxies) or doubled-peaked line profiles resulting from galaxy rotation. One of the most important advantages of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">sherpa</span> is its capability of fitting spectra accounting for the flux density uncertainties. We fitted the intensity, full width at half-maximum (FWHM), and central wavelength of each emission line using Gaussian profiles and a constant for the local continuum. The latter is a good approximation given that we are fitting the starlight-subtracted spectra. Uncertainties for the parameters were calculated at the 1$\sigma$ confidence intervals. This was done by varying a parameter’s value in a grid of values while at the same time the values of the other model parameters were allowed to float to new best-fit values.

We measured the intensities of the forbidden lines \[O<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">iii</span>\] $\lambda$5007, \[N<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">ii</span>\] $\lambda$6583, \[S<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">ii</span>\] $\lambda\lambda$6716, 6731, \[O<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">i</span>\] $\lambda$6300, and the Balmer H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ lines. For five galaxies (NGC 3758, UGC 8058, IRAS 13218+0552, MK 268, and UGC 9412) having spectra with extremely broad lines (Fig. \[Type1AGN\]) no emission line fitting was performed, since from the profile of the lines they could be clearly classified as AGN. Therefore, they were assigned a Sy-1 classification (see Section \[Final\_Class\]). The emission-line intensity

It is seen that at least in the concrete case under consideration the second order perturbation correction (A.8) gives excellent approximation of TD transition energies for all states.

In some cases use of perturbation theory to evaluate excitation energies may be computationally more efficient than the direct diagonalization of either non-symmetric Hamiltonian real matrix or non-Hermitian Schr$\rm \ddot{o}$dinger-type complex matrix. However, to make reliable conclusion about applicability of perturbation approach, heavy numerical testing is required.

In the following we want to demonstrate on the examples of two classes of hybrid EoS models under which conditions the interesting phenomenon of twins at high compact star masses of $\sim 2~M_\odot$ may be obtained. The first one is a phenomenological ansatz Zdunik, Haensel [@Zdunik:2012dj], Alford, Han and Prakash [@Alford:2013aca] which we call the ZHAHP scheme. The second one is based on a QCD motivated, microscopic EoS obtained within a nonlocal Polyakov-NJL model, see [@Blaschke:2013rma] and references therein.

The ZHAHP scheme
----------------

A first order phase transition in neutron star matter can take place just as in symmetric matter where it is searched for in heavy ion collisions. Adopting the setting of the ZHAHP scheme, we construct hybrid stars with a hybrid EoS composed of a given hadronic EoS, here DD2 [@Typel:1999yq], and a quark matter EoS parametrized by its squared speed of sound $c_{\rm QM}^2$ which pretty well describes [@Zdunik:2012dj] results of a color superconducting NJL model [@Lastowiecki:2011hh] $$\label{eos}
P(\varepsilon)= 
P_{\rm DD2}(\varepsilon)\Theta(\varepsilon_{\rm crit}-\varepsilon)
+c_{\rm QM}^2~\varepsilon~\Theta(\varepsilon-\varepsilon_{\rm crit}
-\Delta\varepsilon)~.$$ The critical energy density $\varepsilon_{\rm crit}$ and the discontinuity $\Delta\varepsilon$ complete this three-parameter EoS model which is capable of describing compact star sequences with a third family of stars in the mass-radius diagram. For early works on the disconnected, third branch of stable compact stars and the related mass-twin phenomenon, see Refs. [@Gerlach:1968zz; @Kampfer:1981yr; @Schertler:2000xq; @Glendenning:2000gh]. Searching for sequences with twins obeying the $2~M_\odot$ mass constraint [@Demorest:2010bx; @Antoniadis:2013pzd] we obtain a quasi-horizontal hybrid star branch disconnected by an unstable branch from the almost vertical hadron star branch, as a consequence of a strong phase transition.

We now find that, in order to improve the rigidity statement of Theorem 2.1, the optimal parameters $p, q,$ are $$p = - \frac{1}{2} ,   \quad   q =  1    .$$

For this choice of parameters, the equation (3.4) gives $$\begin{aligned}
&     &  (\varphi, \varphi)^2 (  \overline{\nabla}  \,  \overline{\varphi_p},  \, \overline{\nabla}  \,  \overline{\varphi_p} )     \\
&     &       \\
&  =  &  ( \nabla \varphi,  \nabla  \varphi)  +  \frac{1}{2} (\varphi, \varphi)^{-1} ( D \varphi,  {\rm grad} (\varphi, \varphi)  \cdot \varphi )
 - \frac{3}{8}
(\varphi, \varphi)^{-1}  \vert   {\rm grad} (\varphi, \varphi)    \vert^2  .\end{aligned}$$

Applying the Schrödinger-Lichnerowicz formula $$\triangle(\varphi, \varphi) = -2 ( \nabla \varphi,  \nabla \varphi ) +2 ( D^2 \varphi,  \varphi ) -  \frac{1}{2} S_g  (\varphi,  \varphi) ,$$ where $\triangle = - {\rm div} \circ {\rm grad}$, one proves the following lemma.

For the choice (3.7) of parameters, we have $$\begin{aligned}
&      &  \frac{1}{2} {\rm div} \{ (\varphi, \varphi)^r {\rm grad} (\varphi, \varphi) \}      \\
&      &      \\
& =  &  (\varphi, \varphi)^r    \Big\{   (\varphi, \varphi)^2 (  \overline{\nabla}  \,  \overline{\varphi_p},  \, \overline{\nabla}  \,  \overline{\varphi_p} )    +  \frac{1}{4} S_g  (\varphi,  \varphi)  -   ( D^2 \varphi,  \varphi )     -   \frac{1}{2} (\varphi, \varphi)^{-1} ( D \varphi,  {\rm grad} (\varphi, \varphi)

On utilisera la formule suivante, valable pour tout $h\in{{\mathbb{R}}^n}$ et toutes fonctions $f$ et $g$ sur ${{\mathbb{R}}^n}$: $$\label{1diff}
\Delta_h(fg) = (\Delta_hf)(\tau_{-h}g)
 + f(\Delta_hg)\,.$$ Désignons par $A(f)$ le premier terme de l’inégalité (\[Besovlu\]).

### Étape 1

Soit $f$ une fonction telle que $A(f)<\infty$. Par la formule (\[1diff\]), on a, pour tous $a,h\in {{\mathbb{R}}^n}$ et $|h|\leq t\leq 1/2$, $$\left(\int_{{{\mathbb{R}}^n}} \left| \Delta_{h}( (\tau_a\varphi_0) f) (x)\right|^p{\rm d}x\right)^{1/p}$$ $$\leq \left(\int_{{{\mathbb{R}}^n}}  \left| \Delta_{h}f(x)\varphi_0(x+h-a)\right|^p{\rm d}x\right)^{1/p}+
    \left(\int_{{{\mathbb{R}}^n}} |f(x)|^p\left| \Delta_{h} (\tau_a\varphi_0) (x)\right|^p{\rm d}x\right)^{1/p}$$ $$\leq  \left(\int_{{\mathbb B}+a}   \left| \Delta_{h}f (x)\right|^p{\rm d}x\right)^{1/p} +
    t\left\|\nabla\varphi_0\right\|_\infty\, \left(\int_{{\mathbb B}+a}   \left|f (x)\right|^p{\rm d}x\right)^{1/p}$$ $$\leq c_1\,\left( \omega_{p,{\mathbb B}+a}(f,t) +
    \,t\,  \|f\|_{L^p({{\mathbb{R}}^n})_{lu}}\right)\,.$$ Par la condition $s<1$, on voit que $$\left(\int_0^{1/2} \left( t^{-s} \omega_{p}((\tau_a\varphi_0)f,t)\

Suppose, as is typical, that ${\left\lVert{\operatorname{VE}_{{\scalebox{0.5}[1.0]{$-$}}}}^n-{\operatorname{VE}_{{\scalebox{0.5}[1.0]{$-$}}}}^0\right\rVert}_{2,P_\star^0}$ shrinks slower than ${n_{\textnormal{min}}}^{-1/2}$. In this case, if $\alpha\ge 1$, then the above gives conditions under which $\widehat{\theta}^n=\theta^0 + O_P({\left\lVert{\operatorname{VE}_{{\scalebox{0.5}[1.0]{$-$}}}}^n-{\operatorname{VE}_{{\scalebox{0.5}[1.0]{$-$}}}}^0\right\rVert}_{2,P_\star^0})$, where the big-oh can be replaced by a little-oh if $\alpha>1$.

By \[it:goodquantile\], Lemma \[lem:thetaee\], and \[it:thetaDonsker\], $$\begin{aligned}
o_P({n_{\textnormal{min}}}^{-1/2})=\widehat{\omega}^{\widehat{\beta}^n,n} - \mu= \omega^{\widehat{\beta}^n,0}-\omega^{\beta^0,0} + O_P({n_{\textnormal{min}}}^{-1/2}).\end{aligned}$$ Let $\beta^{n,0}$ denote the function $w\mapsto \operatorname{\mathds{1}}_{\{{\operatorname{VE}_{{\scalebox{0.5}[1.0]{$-$}}}}^0(w)<\widehat{\theta}^n\}}$. The above shows that $$\begin{aligned}
\omega^{\beta^{n,0},0}-\omega^{\beta^0,0}&= -[\omega^{\widehat{\beta}^n,0}-\omega^{\beta^{n,0},0}] + O_P({n_{\textnormal{min}}}^{-1/2})\end{aligned}$$ At the end of this proof, we show that $\omega^{\widehat{\beta}^n,0} - \omega^{\beta^{n,0},0} = o_P(1)$ without using Condition $\alpha$. For now suppose we have established this. By \[it:omegacontnotflat\], $\theta\mapsto\omega^{w\mapsto\operatorname{\mathds{1}}\{{\operatorname{VE}_{{\scalebox{0.5}[1

Discussion of Taylor remainder errors
=====================================

This paper documents an algorithm taking Taylor approximations to the image $\bar{I}$ to Taylor approximations to the normal field $\bar{N}$. Here we discuss the potential errors from using the Taylor approximations rather than the true values.

Recall the multivariate Taylor remainder formula with multi-index notation: $$\begin{aligned}
R_{\bm{a}, k}(\bm{h}) = \sum_{| \alpha | = k + 1} \partial^\alpha f(\bm{a} + c \bm{h}) \frac{\bm{h}^\alpha}{\alpha!} \quad \text{for some} \, c \in (0, 1)\end{aligned}$$

where $\bm{a}$ is the point of expansion, $\bm{h}$ is a vector in $\mathbb{R}^2$, $k$ is the order of the Taylor expansion, and $\alpha$ is a multi-index. We can use this equation to calculate errors for the two Taylor approximations used in the paper. We apply it to an image patch $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$, where we normalize so that $\Omega = \{\bm{a} + \bm{h} \big| \, || \bm{h} || \leq 1 \}$. The error $\delta = I - \bar{I}$ will be bounded proportional to the largest value of the $(k+1)$th derivative of the image $I$ in the image patch centered at $a$: $$\begin{aligned}
\delta_{\bm{a}, k}(\bm{h}) & = \sum_{| \alpha | = k + 1} \partial^\alpha \delta (\bm{a} + c \bm{h}) \frac{\bm{h}^\alpha}{\alpha!} \quad \text{for some} \, c \in (0, 1) \\
& \leq \max_{\bm{v} \in S^1, \, c \in (0, 1)} 2^k \left| \left| {\mathcal{D}}^j I_{\bm{a} + c \bm{h}} \left(\bm{v}^{\bigotimes 2^j} \right) \right| \right|^2\end{aligned}$$

where we have bounded each term in the sum by the largest value and bounded $\bm{h}^\alpha$ by 1.

Similarly, from Section 3.2,

While the dipole-nucleus amplitude probes the statistics of the largest dipole in the quantum evolution, the physics of dipole-dipole scattering is a bit different: Indeed, since the elementary amplitude (for dipoles of respective sizes $r_0$ and $R_0$) at zero rapidity is essentially $T(r_0,R_0)\sim \alpha_s^2\delta(\ln r_0^2/R_0^2)$, it is the very shape of the dipole number distribution that is actually probed (Fig. \[Fig:dd\]). So in order to compute the shape of the amplitude, we need on one hand the probability distribution of the front fluctuations used before, and on the other hand the shape of the dipole number density from the deterministic evolution. We also need to implement [*saturation*]{} in the evolution (see Fig. \[Fig:dd\]c) to comply with the unitarity constraint $T\leq 1$. All in all, we obtain $$T(r_0,y)\underset{r_0\ll 1/Q_s(y)}{\sim} 
\ln^2 \frac{1}{r_0^2 Q_s^2(y)}  e^{\gamma_0 \ln ({r_0^2 Q_s^2(y)})}
\ \ \text{where}
\ \
Q_s^2(y)R_0^2\simeq e^{\bar\alpha\chi^\prime(\gamma_0)y}.
\label{eq:Tdd}$$ Interestingly enough, it differs from the dipole-nucleus case; compare Eq. (\[eq:TdA\]) to Eq. (\[eq:Tdd\]). This is the main prediction of the way of looking at QCD evolution we have promoted at this conference and in Ref. [@Mueller:2014fba].

$[\mathrm{BGN}]$ Let $U$ be an open set of the (2k+1)-dimensional unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^{2k+1}$, let $K\subset U$ be a connected (2k+1)-submanifold with boundary of the sphere $\mathbb{S}^{2k+1}$ and let $\vec{v}$ be an unit vector field on $U$ which coincides with a Hopf flow H along the boundary of $K$. Then $$\begin{aligned}
    \mathrm{vol}(\vec{v})\!\!\!&\geq&\!\!\!\frac{4^{k}}{{2k \choose k}}\mathrm{vol}(K)
    \\
    \\
    \mathcal{E}(\vec{v})\!\!\!&\geq&\!\!\!(\frac{2k+1}{2}+\frac{k}{2k-1})\mathrm{vol}(K)\end{aligned}$$

If $k=1$ we obtain that $\mathrm{vol}(\vec{v})\geq 2\mathrm{vol}(K)$, the volume of the Hopf vector field. In the proof of Theorem 1.2 was used the following important map $\varphi_{t}^{\vec{v}}:\mathbb{S}^{2k+1}\longrightarrow \mathbb{S}^{2k+1}(\sqrt{1+t^{2}})$ given by $\varphi_{t}^{\vec{v}}(x)=x+t\vec{v}(x)$ which was first used in the Milnor’s paper \[M\].\
\
In this work we continue to study the volume and energy of vector fields defined on submanifolds with boundary $K\subset \mathbb{S}^{3}$. In order to find similar results, we say that an unit vector field $\vec{v}$ satisfies the “proportional volume property" if the following inequality hold for some $t>0$ $$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{vol}(\varphi_{t}^{\vec{v}}(K))}{\mathrm{vol}(\mathbb{S}^{3}(\sqrt{1+t^{2}}))}\geq\frac{\mathrm{vol}(K)}{\mathrm{vol}(\mathbb{S}^{3})}\end{aligned}$$ This condition is obviously equivalent to $$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{vol}(\varphi_{t}^{\vec{v}}(K))\geq\mathrm{vol}(K)(1+t^{2})^{3/2}\end

The pseudosynchronization timescale is $\tau_{\rm ps}$ = (7/3($\alpha$ - 3)) $\tau_{\rm circ}$, where $\alpha$ is a dimensionless quantity, representing the ratio of the orbital and rotational angular momentum:

$$\alpha = \frac {q_2}{1+q_2} \frac {1}{r_{\rm g}^{2}} \left( \frac {a}{R_{\rm 1}} \right) ^2 .$$

For a red giant we adopt $r_{\rm g} \approx 0.3$ (Claret, 2007).

In all equations, the masses, the radii and the lumunosities are in solar units.

High-mass X-ray Binaries
========================

The orbital and stellar parameters of 13 High-mass X-ray binaries are given in Table 1 and Table 2 in Stoyanov & Zamanov (2009). We add 2 more objects - 4U 2206+54 and MWC 148. The orbital and stellar parameters are taken from Rib[ó]{} et. al. (2006) and Casares et al. (2012) respectively.

Using Eq.\[circ\_re\] and Eq.\[sync\_re\] we estimate the circularization and synchronization timescales. The results are given in Table \[t-times\]. The lifetime of a star on the main sequence can be estimated as $\tau_{MS} = 10^{10} ({M_\odot}/{M})^{2.5} \; \; {\rm years}$ (Hansen & Kawaler, 1994). Comparing these lifetimes with $\tau_{sync}$ from Table \[t-times\], we see that among the Be/X-ray binaries only for LSI+61$^0$303 is $\tau_{sync} \sim \tau_{MS}$. This is the only Be/X-ray binary for which we can expect considerable changes of the rotation of the primary during the lifetime of the Be star.

The lifetime of the giant is comparable or longer then $\tau_{circ}$  and   $\tau_{sync}$   for the giant/supergiant systems with short orbital periods. The exceptions are V725 Tau and BP Cru, for which $\tau_{sync}$ and $\tau_{circ}$ are longer than the lifetime of the giant/supergiant stage.

Proof. Suppose the statement of the lemma is false. Then there should exist a sequence of continuous almost complex structures $J_k$ with $\norm{
J_k- J^*} _{L^\infty (A)} \lrar 0$, a sequence of immersions $f_{k,i}: W_i
\to X$ with $f_{k,i} \lrar f_i$ in $C^1(A_i)$ such that $f_{k,i} :W_i \to X$ are $h$-uniformly transversal with the same parameters $\delta$ and $M$, and a sequence of $J_k$-holomorphic maps $u_k \in C^0\cap L^{1,2}(\Theta(0,5),
X)$ with $u_k(\Theta(0,5)) \subset A$ and $u_k |_{\d_i\Theta(0,5)} = f_{k,i}
\scirc u^b_{n,i}$ for some continuous $u^b_{n,i} : \d_i\Theta(0,5) \to A_i
\subset W_i$ such that $\norm{du_k}^2_{L^2(\Theta(0,5))} \lrar 0$ and $$\norm{du_k}^2_{L^2(\Theta_3)}\ge \msmall{\gamma_k \over 2} \cdot
\left( \norm{du_k}^2_{L^2(\Theta_2)} +  \norm{du_k}^2_{L^2(\Theta_4)} \right)
\eqno(A3.3.6)$$ with $\gamma_k = 1- 1/k$. [*Lemmas 5.3.1*]{} and [*A3.2.1*]{} provide that in this case

$\diam_h(u_k( \Theta(1,4))) \allowbreak \lrar 0$.

Since $f_{k,i} :W_i \to X$ are $h$-uniformly transversal with the same parameters $\delta$ and $M$, there should exist sequences $x_k \in A$, $x_{k,
0} \in A_0$, and $x_{k,1} \in A_1$ such

Case 1. There is a component $X_i$ such that $\Delta(X_i,(K_X+\Lambda)|_{X_i})=1$. Then by Cor \[equaldelta\] and Cor \[diffdelta\], either $(K_X+\Lambda)|_{X_i}$ is composed with a pencil of elliptic curves, $X_i$ is non-normal, or $(K_X+\Lambda)|_{X_i}$ is very ample.

If $(K_X+\Lambda)|_{X_i}$ is composed with a pencil of elliptic curves, then by Cor \[equaldelta\] and Cor \[diffdelta\], for each irreducible components $X_j$ connected to $X_i$, $(K_X+\Lambda)|_{X_j}$ is composed with a pencil of elliptic curves as well, $X_i\cap X_j$ is a fiber and $\Delta(X_j,(K_X+\Lambda)|_{X_j})=1$. Therefore, inductively, every $(K_X+\Lambda)|_{X_k}$ is composed with a pencil of elliptic curves. Each $X_i$ is connected to at most two other components, as there are at most two fibers as connecting curves which pass through the base point of $|(K_X+\Lambda)|_{X_i}|$ on $X_i$. Thus $X=U$ is a string of such surfaces glued along fibers.

If $(K_X+\Lambda)|_{X_i}$ is very ample. Then by Cor \[equaldelta\] and Cor \[diffdelta\], every other irreducible component $X_j$ connected to $X_i$ has $\Delta(X_j,(K_X+\Lambda)|_{X_j})=0$ and the connecting curves of them are lines. It is easy to check $U=X_i$. Moreover, $K_X+\Lambda$ is very ample by Lemma \[globalsection\].

If $X_i$ is non-normal, then by Lemma \[2comps\] other component $X_j$ is either non-normal or has $\Delta(X_j,(K_X+\Lambda)|_{X_j})=0$ and $X$ is a tree of such surfaces. Let $\nu\colon \tilde{X}\to X$ be a partial normalization along the non-normal curves on $X_j$. It is easy to check that

$$t_{k}^{\frac{N-2}{2}}u_{k}\circ e_{y_{k}}(t_{k}\xi)\longrightarrow0\mbox{ a.e. in }{\mathbb{R}}^{N}.\label{eq:noconc}$$

Furthermore, assume that $u_{k}\to0$ in $L^{p}(M)$ for some $p\in(2,2^{*})$. Then $u_{k}\to0$ in $L^{2^{*}}(M)$.

Step1. For any $u\in H^{1,2}(M)$ the following holds: $$\|u\|_{2^{*}}^{2^{*}}\le C\|u\|_{H^{1,2}}^{2}\sup_{j\in2^{\frac{N-2}{2}{\mathbb{Z}}}}\left(\int_{j\le|u(x)|\le2^{\frac{N-2}{2}}j}|u|^{2^{*}}\mathrm{d}\mu\right)^{\frac{2}{N}}.\label{eq:prange}$$ Indeed, let $\chi\in C_{0}^{1}(2^{-\frac{N-2}{2}},2^{N-2})$, extended by zero to $[0,\infty)$ be such that $\chi(s)\in[0,1]$ for all $s$ and $\chi(s)=1$ whenever $s\in[1,2^{\frac{N-2}{2}}]$. Let $\chi_{j}(s)=j\chi(j^{-1}s)$, ${\normalcolor j\in2^{\frac{N-2}{2}{\mathbb{Z}}}}$.

Applying Sobolev inequality to $\chi_{j}(|u|)$ we get

$$\left(\int_{j\le|u(x)|\le2^{\frac{N-2}{2}}j}|u|^{2^{*}}\mathrm{d}\mu\right)^{2/2^{*}}\le C\int_{2^{-\frac{N-2}{2}}j\le|u(x)|\le2^{N-2}j}(|du|^{2}+|u|^{2})\mathrm{d}\mu,$$ from which we have $$\int_{j\le|u(x)|\le2^{\frac{N-2}{2}}j}|u|^{2^{*}}\mathrm{d} \mu \ \ \le$$ $$C\int_{2^{-\frac

Because the Hessian is equal to the derivative of the $N$th-order eigenvalues with respect to the $N$th-order occupation numbers, at all orders, this matrix must be inverted to find the corresponding occupation numbers. If we know the basis that diagonalizes the entire first-order potential, in this basis, we could rearrange Eq. (\[EqFirstOrder\]) to get $$\begin{split}
&\sum_jn_j^{(1)}\langle\phi_i|\int\frac{\delta{\nu_{ks}(\mathbf{r})}}{\delta\rho({\mathbf{r}}')}\rho_j^{(0)}({\mathbf{r}}')d{\mathbf{r}}'|\phi_i\rangle
=\epsilon^{(1)}\\
&-\langle\phi_i|V^{(1)}+2Re\sum_j\int\frac{\delta{\nu_{ks}(\mathbf{r})}}{\delta\rho({\mathbf{r}}')}\phi_j^{*(1)}({\mathbf{r}}')\phi_j({\mathbf{r}}')d{\mathbf{r}}'|\phi_i\rangle.
\end{split}
\label{EqN1LHS}$$ The left hand side is the zeroth-order Hessian times the first-order occupation numbers. This matrix determines the manner in which the initial occupation numbers extremize the unperturbed energy, assuming the unperturbed orbitals are unchanged for a small change in occupation numbers, and also the way the $M$ and $N$th-order occupation numbers extremize the $M+N$th-order energy. The negative contribution of XC means that the unperturbed state is not necessarily an energy minimum. This has a profound effect on the behavior of the perturbed occupation numbers.

We can demonstrate this by looking at a model problem that can be solved analytically. We will apply a perturbing electric quadrupole potential, given by $V^{(1)}({\mathbf{r}}) = Q(y^2-z^2)/|{\mathbf{r}}|^5$ to a system of three electrons in a harmonic oscillator potential, using the X$\alpha$ functional for exchange and correlation, with and without a self-interaction correction (SIC) [@Perdew1981].

### Disc global eccentricity

As shown by [@Pearce2014; @Pearce2015doublering], a planet on an eccentric orbit can force an eccentricity in a disc of planetesimals through secular interactions. Here we aim to assess if HD 107146’s debris disc could have a global eccentricity and pericentre, using the same parametrization as in [@Marino2017etacorvi], i.e. taking into account the expected apocentre glow [@Pan2016]. We find that the disc is consistent with being axisymmetric, with a 2$\sigma$ upper limit of 0.03 for the forced eccentricity. We find though that the marginalised distribution of ${e_\mathrm{d}}$ peaks at 0.02 with a pericentre that is opposite to the residual inner clump. This peak is likely produced as the residuals are lower when the disc is eccentric and with an apocentre oriented towards the clump’s position angle due to apocentre glow. We therefore conclude that the fit is biased by the inner clump and that the disc is probably not truly eccentric.

### Inner component {#sec:modelin}

In order to constrain the geometry or distribution of the inner emission found in the residuals, we add an extra inner component by introducing five additional parameters to our reference parametric model (3-power law surface density with a Gaussian gap). We parametrise its surface density as a 2D Gaussian in polar coordinates, with a total dust mass ${M_\mathrm{c}}$ and centered at a radius ${r_\mathrm{c}}$ and azimuthal angle ${\omega_\mathrm{c}}$ (measured in the plane of the disc from the disc PA and increasing in an anti-clockwise direction). The width of this Gaussian is parametrized with a radial FWHM ${\Delta r_\mathrm{c}}$ and an azimuthal standard deviation ${\sigma_{\phi}}$. Best fit values are presented in Table \[tab:mcmc\]. We find that this inner component is extended both radially and azimuthally, but concentrated around $19\pm3$ au and orthogonal to the disc PA (${\omega_\mathrm{c}}\sim90\degr$), as we found in the residuals of our axisymmetric model. In the right panel of Figure \[fig:res\] we present the model image of the best fit model and its residuals, which are below $3\sigma$ in both band 6 and 7 within the disc inner edge. We also find that the total

We then have the following result:

\[th:L1\] We assume here that the system is positive and that $w\in L_1$. Then, the following statements are equivalent:

(a) The system with is stochastically stable in the $L_1$-sense and the $L_1$-gain of the transfer $w\mapsto z$ is equal to $\gamma^*>0$.

(b) The $L_1$-gain $\gamma^*>0$ of the system is the optimal value of the linear program $$\gamma^*=\inf_{\gamma>0,\lambda_1>0,\ldots,\lambda_N>0}\gamma$$ such that $\lambda_i\in\mathbb{R}_{>0}^n$, $i=1,\ldots,N$, and $$\label{eq:L1cond1}

              \end{array}$$ for all $i=1,\ldots,N$.

Stochastic $L_\infty$ performance of positive Markov jump linear systems

Let us consider now the computation of the $L_\infty$-gain which is given by:

The stochastic $L_\infty$-gain of the system is defined as the smallest $\xi>0$ such that $$\sup_{t\ge0}\{||\operatorname{ \mathbb{E}}[z(t)]||_\infty\}]\le\xi\sup_{t\ge0}\{||\operatorname{ \mathbb{E

\[lem:lowerBoundOnZ\] If $A \subseteq {\mathbb{F}}_2^n$, $|A+A| = K|A|$, then $\operatorname*{E}[Z] \geq \frac{|A|}{16 K^2}$ (where the expectation is over the uniform random choice of $\beta_1$ to $\beta_4$ in $A$).

We see that $$\begin{aligned}
\operatorname*{E}[Z] &= 
\operatorname*{E}\Bigl[ \sum_{a \in A}
{\langle}a \in A({\beta_1+\beta_2}) \land |A({\beta_1+\beta_2})|\geq\tfrac{|A|}{2K} {\rangle}\times\nonumber\\

\\
& =

\Pr[a \in A({\beta_1+\beta_2}) \land |A({\beta_1+\beta_2})|\geq\frac{|A|}{2K}]\Bigr)^2}{|A|}\label{eq:1}\end{aligned}$$

We now observe that $$\begin{aligned}
\Pr_{\beta_1,\beta_2 \in A}\Bigl[|A({\beta_1+\beta_2})| \leq \frac{|A|}{2K}\Bigr]
\leq
\frac{|A+A| \frac{|A|}{2K}}{|A|^2} = \frac12.\end{aligned}$$ and so $$\begin{aligned}

J. Salfi,

The one-bond system in Fig. 1 (a) is taken as 4-level dimer to model the ionic-covalent bonding. When one quasielectron is removed from such a dimer, the remained one occupying $| 1 \rangle \otimes | \sigma \rangle $ in Fig. 2 (b) has no correlated partner. Because atom A has the higher electro-negativity, we can approximate the remained quasielectron by $\rho ^{(1)}$ in Eq. (11) and obtain the energy $E_{b} ^{(-)} = tr H _{sb} \rho ^{(1)}$ as $| \Psi _{b} \rangle$ becomes the uncorrelated one-electron state $| \Psi _{b,1, \uparrow } \rangle = c _{ A  \uparrow } ^{\dag} | 0 \rangle$ or $| \Psi _{b,1, \downarrow } \rangle = c _{ A  \downarrow } ^{\dag} | 0 \rangle$. On the other hand, there are three quasielectrons when we change $| \Psi _{b} \rangle$ to a three-electron state, which corresponds to the left-hand side of Fig. 2(c), by the affinitve process. We can see from Fig. 2 (c) that such a three-electron state is equivalent to the one-hole state because there are only 4 levels. The remained quasihole is located at $| \bar{1} \rangle \otimes | \sigma \rangle$, and its spatial part $| \bar{1} \rangle$ can be approximated by $ | B \rangle $ in $\mathbb{C}^{2} _{\Omega}$ because atom $B$ is of the lower electro-negativity. So we can take $| \Psi _{b,3, \sigma } \rangle = c _{ B \sigma} | Fb \rangle \propto c _{ B \underline{ \sigma } } ^{ \dag } c _{ A \sigma } ^{\dag} c _{ A \underline{\sigma} } ^{\dag} | 0 \rangle  \propto c _{ L \underline{\sigma} } ^{\dag} c _{ A \sigma } ^{\dag} c _{ \bar{L} \underline{\sigma} } ^{\dag} | 0 \rangle$ as the wavefunction of the three-electron or one-hole state for $\sigma = \uparrow$ or $\downarrow$, and the added electron is located at the spatial ket $|

In Figure \[fig:bounce\_moreFV\], we denote bounce solutions for false vacuum bubbles in true vacuum backgrounds by potentials in Figure \[fig:moreFV\] ($\Phi_{\mathrm{f}}>1$). We plot $\Phi$, $\rho$, and $\dot{\rho}$ as functions of $\eta$.

We also note that behaviors of $\dot{\rho}$ ($\cos$, $1$, $\cosh$, etc.) are consistent for the inside and the outside of the transition region.

\[sec:via\]False vacuum bubble nucleation via effective potentials
------------------------------------------------------------------

Although $V(\Phi_{\mathrm{t}}) < V(\Phi_{\mathrm{f}})$, if the vacuum energy of $\Phi_{\mathrm{f}}$ in the Einstein frame is smaller than that of $\Phi_{\mathrm{t}}$, i.e., $U_{E}(\Phi_{\mathrm{t}}) > U_{E}(\Phi_{\mathrm{f}})$, where $U_{E}$ is the potential in the Einstein frame, then, interestingly, it may be possible to obtain a false vacuum bubble in the Jordan frame, even if $\omega > -3/2$. Note that the dynamics of the Brans-Dicke field is determined by the effective potential $U$. Hence, we also should check whether $U(\Phi_{\mathrm{t}}) > U(\Phi_{\mathrm{f}})$.

Note that such conditions can be represented as $$\begin{aligned}
V(\Phi_{\mathrm{f}})-V(\Phi_{\mathrm{t}}) = \Phi_{\mathrm{f}}^{2} \left( \int_{1}^{\Phi_{\mathrm{f}}} \frac{F(\bar{\Phi})}{\bar{\Phi}^{3}} d \bar{\Phi} + V_{0} \right) - V_{0} > 0\end{aligned}$$ and $$\begin{aligned}
U_{E}(\Phi_{\mathrm{f}})-U_{E}(\Phi_{\mathrm{t}}) = \int_{1}^{\Phi_{\mathrm{f}}} \frac{F(\bar{\Phi})}{\bar{\Phi}^{3}} d \bar{\Phi} \equiv \Delta E < 0.\end{aligned}$$ Therefore, we require $V_{0} > \Phi^{2}_{\mathrm{f}} |\Delta E|/ (\Phi^{2}_{\mathrm{f}}-1)$ and we conclude that such false vacuum bubbles can form only in a de Sitter space background ($

As introduced by [@beaver], used by [@bogdanov-laur-willemson], and reviewed in Table \[Beaver\], privacy-preserving multiplication of $U$ and $X$ is also possible whenever $U$ and $X$ are matrices such that their product $UX$ is well-defined. Summing across the two parties in line 10 of Table \[Beaver\] would yield $PR + (U-P)R + P(X-R) + (U-P)(X-R) = UX$, as desired. Notice that $U-P$ and $X-R$ in lines 8 and 9 of Table \[Beaver\] are still masked by the random matrices $P$ and $R$ whose values are unknown to the two parties. The all-reduce in lines 8 and 9 requires the parties to conspire and distribute to each other the results of summing their respective shares of lines 6 and 7, but does not require the parties to get shares of any secret distributed data — that was necessary only for the original data $U$ and $X$ being multiplied (and this “original” data can be the result of prior secure multiparty computations). Also, all values on lines 3–5 are independent of $U$ and $X$, so can be precomputed and stored on disk. As with addition, multiplication via the Beaver scheme never requires securely distributing secret shares, so long as the input data and so-called Beaver triples $(P, R, PR)$ from Table \[Beaver\] have already been securely distributed into shares. The secure distribution of shares is completely separate from the processing of the resulting distributed data set. Communication among the parties during processing is solely via the all-reduce in lines 8 and 9.

Table \[Beaver\]’s scheme also works with matrix multiplication replaced by convolution of sequences.

In the FMD approach we employ Gaussian wave packets $$\label{eq:wavepacket}
  {\big\langle {{\mathbf{x}}} \big| {q} \big\rangle} = \exp\left\{-\frac{({\mathbf{x}}-{\mathbf{b}})^2}{2 a}\right\}
   \otimes {\big| \,{\chi^\uparrow, \chi^\downarrow}\, \big> } \otimes {\big| \,{\xi}\, \big> }$$ as single-particle basis states. The complex parameters ${\mathbf{b}}$ encode the mean positions and momenta of the wave packets and $a$ the widths of the wave packets. The spins can assume any direction, isospin is $\pm 1$ denoting a proton or a neutron. Intrinsic many-body basis states are Slater determinants $$\label{eq:sldet}
  {\big| \,{Q}\, \big> } = \mathcal{A} \left\{\ {\big| \,{q_1}\, \big> } \otimes \ldots \otimes {\big| \,{q_A}\, \big> }\ \right\} \:$$ that reflect deformation or clustering and break the symmetries of the Hamiltonian with respect to parity, rotation and translation. To restore the symmetries the intrinsic basis states are projected on parity, angular momentum and total linear momentum $${\big| \,{Q; J^\pi MK; {\mathbf{P}}=0}\, \big> } = {\hat{P}}^\pi {\hat{P}}^J_{MK} {\hat{P}}^{{\mathbf{P}}=0} \; {\big| \,{Q}\, \big> } .$$ In a full FMD calculation the many-body Hilbert space is spanned by a set of $N$ projected intrinsic basis states $\left\{\ {\big| \,{Q^{(a)}; J^\pi MK; {\mathbf{P}}=0}\, \big> } , a=1,\ldots,N \ \right\}$. By diagonalizing the Hamiltonian in this set of non-orthogonal basis states the amplitudes of the various configurations contained in the many-body eigenstate are determined.

Starting from the realistic Argonne V18 interaction [@wiringa95] we derive a phase-shift-equivalent effective low-momentum interaction using the unitary correlation operator method (UCOM). The basic idea of the UCOM approach is to explicitly include short-range central and tensor correlations by means of a unitary operator [@ucom98

PRECISION MEASUREMENTS AND EFFECTIVE LAGRANGIANS
================================================

In the examples given so far we assumed specific models and examined how well precisions measurements could either detect them or discriminate them from other models. A more general approach is to use the language of effective Lagrangians [@Krstonosic:2005qp; @Kilian:2005bz; @Osland:2005ee]. Generically ${\cal L}_{eff}$ can be written: $${\cal L}_{eff}={\cal L}_{SM}+\sum_i {{c_i}\over{\Lambda^p} }
{\cal O}^{(4+p)}$$ where $\Lambda$ reflects the scale of new physics and the details of the new physics (couplings, chiral structure etc.) are parametrized in the coefficients $c_i$. For example, new interactions such as $s$-channel $Z'$’ or $t$-channel leptoquark exchange can be parametrized as 4-fermion interactions if $\sqrt{s}<< \Lambda$.

In the gauge sector the trilinear gauge boson vertex $\gamma WW$ can be sensitive to new physics via new particles included in the vertex loop corrections [@Monig:2005ge]. It has become the practice to parametrize the trilinear gauge boson vertices in terms of $k_\gamma$ and $\lambda_\gamma$. Mönig and Sekaric presented results of a detailed simulation including polarization and backgrounds of $\gamma\gamma\to W^+W^-\to q\bar{q}q\bar{q}$ at $\sqrt{s}_{ee}=500$ GeV [@Monig:2005ge]. Their results on $k_\gamma$ and $\lambda_\gamma$ sensitivities comparing $e^+e^-$, $e\gamma$ and $\gamma\gamma$ modes for $\sqrt{s}_{ee}=500$ GeV and ${\cal L}_{int}=1000$ fb$^{-1}$ are shown in Table \[monig\].

Jung [*et al.*]{} have used our Eq. (14) to calculate the dynamical resistance of two infinite jellium electrodes separated by a vacuum gap [@JBG]. By using the local-density dependent formula for the viscosity coefficient as reported in Ref. [@CV] they conclude that the dynamical resistance is negligibly small in the specific cases they consider. Here we argue that their calculations do not preclude the possibility that the viscosity contribution to the conductance be large in realistic nanoscale structures, the systems of interest in Ref. [@SZVD]. Two main points support this statement.

1\) Our Eq. (14) is an approximate formula, derived under certain physical assumptions (see below) in order to provide a qualitative understanding of the viscous effects in nanostructures. As noted in Ref. [@SZVD], Eq. (14) was derived assuming homogeneous density in the transverse direction [*and*]{} homogeneous current density in both transverse and longitudinal directions. The only contribution to the correction we included in Eq. (14) comes from density variations along the longitudinal direction. It is on the ground of these assumptions that we adopted the viscosity of the bulk electrodes in the model calculations. We did not claim any quantitative accuracy of our estimates in Ref. [@SZVD].

In realistic nanoscale structures, the current density may vary rapidly in the transverse direction due to a decrease of velocity from the center of the channel to the sides of the conductors. The transverse density and current density gradients can thus contribute significantly to the dissipation effects. The contribution can be further enhanced in the presence of turbulent eddies near the contacts [@SBHD; @DD]. To capture these gradient contributions, one needs to evaluate the dissipation power $dE/dt = - \int e
\vec{j}\cdot\vec{E}_{xc}d\vec r$ directly (and the associated resistance as $R^{dyn}=(dE/dt)/I^2$, with $I$ the total current), because the nonconservative nature of the dynamical xc field makes it, in general, ambiguous to evaluate a line integral as in Ref. [@SZVD]. If, once again, the current density and viscosity are assumed constant, the correction to the resistance evaluated from the power dissipated is given by $R^{dyn} =
\frac{\eta}{e^2A^2}\int \left[\frac{4}{3}(\partial_z n^{-1})^2 +
(\partial_\perp

We have studied both types of surface termination for all three materials (PbTiO$_3$, BaTiO$_3$, and SrTiO$_3$) using a repeated slab geometry. The slabs are symmetrically terminated and typically contain seven layers (17 or 18 atoms), as illustrated in Fig. \[fig:slab\]. The vacuum region was chosen to be two lattice constants thick. The calculations were done using a (4,4,2) Monkhorst-Pack mesh,[@mesh] corresponding to three or four k-points in the irreducible Brillouin zone for cubic and tetragonal surfaces respectively. The convergence of the calculations has been very carefully checked for PbTiO$_3$ by repeating some of the calculations with asymmetrically terminated eight-layer slabs and symmetrically terminated nine-layer slabs. Additionally, we have enlarged the vacuum region to a thickness of three lattice constants, and we have checked the convergence of the Brillouin zone integration by going to a (6,6,2) k-point mesh. In all cases, the results for the structural properties of the surfaces given in the Tables \[tab:relaxI\] to \[tab:fedist\] change by less than 0.2%.

For all three materials, we first computed the relaxations for the “cubic” surface, i.e., for the case where there is no symmetry lowering relative to a slab of ideal cubic material. In this case we preserved $M_x$, $M_y$, and $M_z$ mirror symmetries relative to the center of the slab, and set the lattice constants in the $\widehat{x}$ and $\widehat{y}$ directions equal to those computed theoretically for the corresponding bulk material (3.89 Å, 3.95 Å, and 3.86 Å for PbTiO$_3$, BaTiO$_3$, and SrTiO$_3$, respectively). The symmetry-allowed displacements of the atoms in the $z$ (surface-normal) direction were then fully relaxed.

Each of the three materials studied displays a different sequence of structural phase transitions from the cubic paraelectric phase as the temperature is lowered.[@lines] PbTiO$_3$ undergoes a single transition into a tetragonal ferroelectric (FE) phase at 763K and then remains in this structure down to zero temperature. BaTiO$_3$ displays a series of three transitions to tetragonal, orthorhombic,

At least three filaments are highlighted in both the [*Herschel*]{} maps (see vertical lines in Figures \[fig2\]a and \[fig2\]b). Among these filaments, an elongated filamentary feature (length $\sim$8.3 pc) is identified using a column density contour with a level of 3.94 $\times$ 10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, which is marked in Figures \[fig2\]a and \[fig2\]b. The total mass of the filamentary feature is estimated to be $\sim$1170 M$_{\odot}$, and is computed using the equation, $M_{area} = \mu_{H_2} m_H Area_{pix} \Sigma N(H_2)$, where $\mu_{H_2}$ is the mean molecular weight per hydrogen molecule (i.e., 2.8), $Area_{pix}$ is the area subtended by one pixel (i.e., 6$''$/pixel), and $\Sigma N(\mathrm H_2)$ is the total column density [see also @dewangan17]. The other two filaments show a temperature range of about 13–13.5 K, and seem to be directed toward the central part of the filamentary feature. The locations of the infrared shell and the IRDCs are located within the central part of the filamentary feature, which is indicated in the [*Herschel*]{} maps. One can note that a column density deficient region is found in the direction of the infrared shell (see Figure \[fig2\]b and also Figure \[fig2a\]a). The central part of the filamentary feature is traced using a column density contour with the level of $\sim$9–11 $\times$ 10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, where the maximum value of the column density is estimated to be $\sim$3.7 $\times$ 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. Earlier, @krumholz08 reported a threshold value of 1 gm cm$^{-2}$ (or corresponding column density $\sim$3 $\times$ 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$) for formation of massive stars. Hence, it is likely that massive stars can be formed within the central part of the filamentary feature. Interestingly, @lee11 suggested the presence of massive protostar candidates toward the dense cores. The [*Herschel*]{} temperature map shows an extended temperature structure toward the central part of the filamentary feature. The infrared shell is spatially located

In the framework of the classical Besov spaces, it is well known that $\cx \in B^s_{p,q} (\rn)$ if and only if $$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq-000}
\mbox{either} \quad  s=1/p \quad  \mbox{and} \quad q= \infty
\qquad \mbox{or} \quad s<1/p\quad  \mbox{and} \quad q\in(0,\infty]\, ;\end{aligned}$$ see [@RS Lemma 2.3.1/3]. This means that, for fixed $p \in (0,\fz]$, the smallest Besov space, which the function $\cx$ belongs to, is given by $B^{1/p}_{p,\infty} (\rn)$. Now we turn to the smoothness of $\cx$ and $h_{i,j,m}$ with respect to the scale ${{B}_{p,q}^{s,\tau}(\rn)}$.

\[charact\] Let $s \in \rr$ and $p$, $q\in (0,\fz]$.

1.  Let $\tau \in(1/p,\fz)$. Then $\cx \in {{B}_{p,q}^{s,\tau}(\rn)}$ if and only if $s \le n (1/p - \tau )$.

2.  Let $\tau \in [0, 1/p]$. Then $\cx \in {{B}_{p,q}^{s,\tau}(\rn)}$ if and only if either $$\begin{aligned}
    \label{eq-001}
    s = \frac 1p,\,  \qquad q=\infty \qquad \mbox{and}\qquad  s \le n \lf(\frac 1p - \tau \right)\end{aligned}$$ or $$\begin{aligned}

    s < \frac 1p,\,  \qquad q\in(0, \infty] \qquad  \mbox{and}
    \qquad s \le n \lf(\frac 1p - \tau \right)\, .\end{aligned}$$

When $k= 2$, note the useful fact that whenever two curves $\gamma,\eta \in \Gamma$ have homotopic projections in $S_{g,n-1}$, we must have that $\gamma,\eta$ are disjoint: If not, there are subarcs $\gamma_p,\eta_p$ of $\gamma,\eta$ that bound a once-punctured bigon in $S_{n}$, punctured by $p$. The assumption that $\gamma$ and $\eta$ are homotopic after filling $p$ implies that $\gamma \setminus \gamma_p$ and $\eta \setminus \eta_p$ must jointly bound another bigon on $S_{n-

The method of perturbative matching is somewhat paradoxical. We have assumed that $M$ is large enough that perturbation theory is accurate at the scale $M$. We allow for the scale $Mv$ to be small enough that perturbation theory is not reliable at that scale. If that is the case, perturbative calculations in NRQCD would never give accurate results for physical observables, since NRQCD only reproduces full QCD accurately at scales of order $Mv$ or less. Nevertheless, a comparison of perturbative calculations in NRQCD and full QCD can be used to accurately determine the parameters in the NRQCD lagrangian. The reason for this is that the tuning of the parameters of NRQCD that makes this theory equivalent to QCD at momenta of order $Mv$ or smaller also makes the perturbative approximations to these theories equivalent. Perturbation theory breaks down in precisely the same way for both theories, predicting among other things, the existence of asymptotic states consisting of isolated quarks and gluons. Since the parameters in the NRQCD lagrangian are sensitive only to momenta on the order of $M$ where perturbative QCD is accurate, they can be correctly determined by matching perturbative calculations in QCD and NRQCD.

As an illustration of perturbative matching, we consider the simplest perturbative observable. This is the energy-momentum relation for the heavy quark, which is given by the location of the pole in the heavy-quark propagator. At tree level in full QCD, the energy-momentum relation is $$E \;=\; \sqrt {m^2_Q + p^2}
\;=\; m_Q \;+\; {p^2 \over 2m_Q} \;-\; {p^4 \over 8 m^3_Q}
\;+\; \dots .
\label{E-QCD}$$ At tree level in NRQCD, we can read off the energy momentum relation from the lagrangian (\[L-NRQCD\]): $$E \;=\; {p^2 \over 2M} \;-\; c_1 {p^4 \over 8 M^3} \;+\; \dots .
\label{E-NRQCD}$$ By matching the expressions (\[E-QCD\]) and (\[E-NRQCD\]) we find $$M \;=\; m_Q, \qquad c_1\;=\; 1.
\label{M-cl}$$ If the energy-momentum relations are computed to higher order in perturbation theory, the

Around 30-50 independent magnitude measures of standard stars were derived per filter using the [apphot]{} task within IRAF, in order to secure the transformation from the instrumental to the SDSS $gr$ standard system. Standard stars were distributed over an area similar to that of the GMOS array, so that we measured magnitudes of standard stars in each of the three chips. The relationships between instrumental and standard magnitudes were obtained by fitting the following equations:

$$g = g_1 + g_{std} + g_2\times X_g + g_3\times (g-r)_{std}$$

$$r = r_1 + r_{std} + r_2\times X_r + r_3\times (g-r)_{std}$$

where $g_i$, and $r_i$ (i=1,2,3) are the fitted coefficients, and $X$ represents the effective airmass. We solved the transformation equations for the three chips with the [fitparams]{} task in IRAF, simultaneously; the rms errors from the transformation to the standard system being 0.015 mag for $g$ and 0.023 for $r$, respectively, indicating an excellent match to the standard system.

The stellar photometry was performed using the star-finding and point-spread-function (PSF) fitting routines in the [daophot/allstar]{} suite of programs (Stetson et al., 1990). For each frame, a quadratically varying PSF was derived by fitting $\sim$ 60 stars, once the neighbors were eliminated using a preliminary PSF derived from the brightest, least contaminated 20-30 stars. Both groups of PSF stars were interactively selected. We then used the [allstar]{} program to apply the resulting PSF to the identified stellar objects and to create a subtracted image which was used to find and measure magnitudes of additional fainter stars. This procedure was repeated three times for each frame. Finally, we computed aperture corrections from the comparison of PSF and aperture magnitudes by using the neighbor-subtracted PSF star sample. After deriving the photometry for all detected objects in each filter, a cut was made on the basis of the parameters returned by [daophot]{}. Only objects with $\chi$ $<$2, photometric error less than 2$\sigma$ above the mean error at a given magnitude, and $|$SHARP$|$ $<$ 0.5 were kept in each filter (typically discarding about 10

Let $U$ be an open subgroup of the restricted product $\prod'{\operatorname{H}}^1(k_v,M)$. $U$ is a product of subgroups $U_v \subset {\operatorname{H}}^1(k_v,M)$. If $U$ is a proper subgroup, then all but finitely many of these are equal to the unramified subgroup. If $U_v^\perp$ denotes the exact annihilator of $U_v$ with respect to the Tate pairing, then $U^\perp := \prod U_v^\perp$ is an open subgroup of $\prod'{\operatorname{H}}^1(k,M^\vee)$. Note that when $U = 0$, $U^\perp$ is the entire restricted product and conversely.

Let us use $V_U$ and $V_{U^\perp}$ to denote the subgroups of global classes which map into $U$ and $U^\perp$, repsectively (i.e. $$\begin{aligned}
V_U &= \{ \xi \in {\operatorname{H}}^1(k,M)\,|\,\forall v,\, {\operatorname{res}}_v(\xi) \in U_v\}, \text{ and}\\ V_{U^\perp} &= \{ \eta \in {\operatorname{H}}^1(k,M^\vee)\,|\,\forall v,\,{\operatorname{res}}_v(\eta) \in U_v^\perp\}\,).\end{aligned}$$ Let $T$ denote any finite set of primes and let $I' = ({\operatorname{res}}_T{{\mbox{{

Introduction {#introduction .unnumbered}
============

Discovery of sterile neutrinos would have a revolutionary impact on neutrino and particle physics.

Sterile neutrinos can hide, mimic or distort reactor antineutrino disappearance pattern in the atmospheric oscillation channel.

The notion of sterile neutrinos ${\nu}_s$ was originally introduced by B. Pontecorvo in 1967 y \[1\] and later has been considered by many authors: D. Caldwell and R. Mohapatra \[2\], S. Bilenky, C. Giunti and W. Grimus \[3\], K. Benakli and A. Smirnov \[4\], B. Kayser \[5\]. Information on theory of sterile (and mirror) neutrinos and references can be found in the recent paper by V. Berezinsky, M. Narayan, F. Vissani \[6\].

An experimental hint in favor of sterile neutrinos comes from unconfirmed observations of LSND collaboration \[7\] on ${\nu}_{\mu} \rightarrow

Because all FORCAST data were taken in the dichroic mode, one can determine precise relative astrometry of the two wavelength images that were obtained simultaneously. The relative astrometry between filters is known to better than 0.5 pixels ($\sim$0$\farcs$38). All images then had their astrometry absolutely calibrated using *Spitzer* data by matching up the centroids of point sources in common between the *Spitzer* and *SOFIA* data. Absolute astrometry of the final *SOFIA* images is assumed to be better than 1$\farcs$0.

In order to perform photometry on MIR point sources, we employed the aperture photometry program *aper.pro*, which is part of the IDL DAOPHOT package available in The IDL Astronomy User’s Library (http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov).

Comparing *SOFIA* Images to Previous Imaging Observations {#sec:results1}
=========================================================

W51 was first detected as an region by @1958BAN....14..215W through its free-free radio continuum emission. Over a decade later it was identified as a molecular cloud from its CO emission [@1971ApJ...165..229P]. The 430 MHz observations of @1967AnAp...30...59K were the first to resolve W51 into four large ($\sim$10–20$\arcmin$) radio components, which were labeled A through D, with W51A being the brightest among them. @1970ApL.....5...99W, were the first to further resolve W51A into two components labeled G49.5-0.4 and G49.4-0.3. @1972MNRAS.157...31M observed W51A in centimeter continuum emission and further resolved G49.5-0.4 into eight regions named a through h, and G49.4-0.3 into three regions labeled a through c. About two decades later, @1994ApJS...91..713M identified G49.5-0.4i and G49.4-3d, e, and f from Very Large Array (VLA) centimeter observations. G49.5-0.4j was first defined by @2000ApJ...543..799O. Peaks and compact sources within or near these regions are indexed with numbers. Our *SOFIA* imaging data covers the entire

-   If $p\in (0,p_c)$, then $G$ contains no infinite cluster.

-   If $p\in (p_c,1)$, then $G$ contains $\mu_p$ almost surely one unique infinite cluster.

-   If $p\ne p_c$, then $\chi^f(p)<+\infty$.

If $G$ is a subgraph of ${\ensuremath{\mathbb{L}^d}}$ and if $\nu$ is a probability measure on ${\ensuremath{\mathbb{R}}}$, we will define the color-probability $P^{G,\nu}$ as follows: $P^{G,\nu}$ is the only measure on $({\ensuremath{\mathbb{R}}}^{{\ensuremath{\mathbb{Z}^d}}},\mathcal{B}({\ensuremath{\mathbb{R}}}^{{\ensuremath{\mathbb{Z}^d}}}))$ under which the canonical projections $X_i$ – defined, as usually by $X_i(\omega)=\omega_i$ – satisfy

-   For each $i\in{\ensuremath{\mathbb{Z}^d}}$, the law of $X_i$ is $\nu$.

-   For each independent set $S\subset{\ensuremath{\mathbb{Z}^d}}$, the variables $(X_i)_{i\in S}$ are independent.

-   For each connected set $S\subset{\ensuremath{\mathbb{Z}^d}}$, the variables $(X_i)_{i\in S}$ are identical.

The randomized color-measure is defined by $$P^{p,\nu}=\int
P^{G,\nu}\ d\mu_p(G).$$

We also note $\Lambda_n=\{-n,\dots,n\}^d$.

For the one-dimensional motion $x(t)$ the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$ is given by $$\lambda=\lim_{t\to\infty}t^{-1}\ln {dx(t)\over dx(0)}.$$ It presumably follows from the quasiperiodicity of $x(t)$ alone that $dx(t)/dx(0)$ is similarly quasiperiodic. In any case, we have by equivariance that $|\psi(x(t),t)|^2dx(t)=|\psi(x(0),0)|^2dx(0)$, so that $$\label{dx} 
 dx(t)/dx(0)={|\psi(x(0),0)|^2\over |\psi_{y_1,\dots,y_n}(F(y_1,\dots,y_n))|^2}$$ with $y_i=\omega_i t$. Hence $dx(t)/dx(0)$ is quasiperiodic with $n$ frequencies and thus $\lambda=0$.

Remarks: (i) In one-dimension we always have that $dx(t)/dx(0)=|\psi(x(0),0)|^2/|\psi(x(t),t)|^2$. Thus the vanishing of the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$ is more general than described here, and should be valid for any wave function, on the circle as well as the line. After all, for bound states the ratio on the right is not likely to grow or decrease in any systematic way at all, while for states with continuous spectrum the behavior will be at most power law; in no case will there be exponential growth or decay. (ii) Another aspect of chaos, the weak convergence of densities to the “equilibrium” distribution (for Bohmian mechanics given by $|\psi(x(t),t)|^2$) will, as a simple consequence of the order preserving character of such motions, almost always fail for any one-dimensional flow, Bohmian or otherwise. The sole exception can occur only when the asymptotic “equilibrium” distribution is concentrated on a single (perhaps moving) point, something that is impossible for Bohmian mechanics.

-   None of the groups $G_{2}(5^n)$ are a $(2,4,5)$-group for any $n$. Neither are the groups $SL_{3}(5^n)$ or $SU_{3}(5^n)$.

1.  Each subgroup $\textup{Sym}_{5}$ in part (ii) here contains a subgroup $\textup{Alt}_{5}$ arising from [@Liebeck2011 Theorem 1(ii)].

2.  Keeping track of details in the proof in [@Liebeck2011] shows that $G_{2}(K)$ has a unique class of subgroups $\textup{Alt}_{5}$. These subgroups have centraliser $\textup{Sym}_{3}$, and by Lang’s theorem these split into three classes in $G_{2}(5^r)$, with centraliser orders $6$, $3$ and $2$. Similarly, if $S$ and $S'$ are representatives of the two subgroup classes in part (ii) here, then $C_{G}(S) \cong \textup{Sym}_{3}$, while $C_{G}(S')$ is cyclic of order $2$. It follows that the class of $S$ (resp. $S'$) splits into $3$ (resp. $2$) classes of subgroups in $G_{2}(5^r)$, with centralisers of order $6$, $3$, $2$ (resp. $2$ and $2$).

3.  A conjecture of Marion [@Marion2010] states that, for a simple algebraic group $G$ in characteristic $p$, if $\delta_{i}$ denotes the dimension of the variety of elements of $G$ of order $i$ and if $\delta_{a} + \delta_{b} + \delta_{c} = 2\, \textup{dim}(G)$, then at most finitely many of the finite groups $G(p^{r})$ are $(a,b,c)$-groups. For $G$ of type $G_{2}$, this criterion holds precisely when $(a,b,c) = (2,4,5)$ or $(2,5,5)$. Hence part (iii), together with [@Liebeck2011 Theorem 1(iii)], verifies the conjecture for $G = G_{2}$ in characteristic $5$. A non-constructive proof of this fact is given in [@Jambor2017 Proposition 3.7(i)], where it is

ABSTRACT

The Higgs could couple to a topological 4-form sector which yields a complex vacuum structure. In general such couplings could lead to direct CP violation in the Higgs sector. In many of the Higgs vacua electroweak symmetry is unbroken. In just as many it breaks when the 4-form flux is large enough. For a fixed value of flux, the symmetry breaking vacua have a smaller vacuum energy than the symmetric ones, where the difference is quantized because it is set by the $4$-form flux. This leads to the possibility that there is a value of the 4-form flux for any UV contributions to the Higgs [*vev*]{} that automatically cancels it down to the right value, $\sim$ TeV, if the 4-form charges are quantized in the units of the electroweak scale. This would still leave the cosmological constant which could be selected anthropically.

Introduction
============

Why is the Standard Model (SM) so light? In the standard formulation of the SM, the masses of all particles, including the Higgs, are set by the Higgs [*vev*]{} after the electroweak (EW) spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). However, if there are any additional heavy degrees of freedom in the universe, which could either play a role in the unification of forces or be dark matter, that have non-ignorable couplings to the Higgs, the Higgs [*vev*]{} would receive significant contributions from their vacuum fluctuations. If string theory is right, this seems inevitable, since all of light QFT should be understood as an EFT with many heavy states integrated out. Without an obvious cancellation mechanism as for example low scale SUSY, it is puzzling to see that such heavy states do not influence the observed low energy physics more significantly.

The SM, therefore, appears to be special. Its specialty is tracked down to the special value of a single dimensional number, the Higgs [*vev*]{}. This evokes an obvious analogy to another very special dimensional parameter characterizing the universe, the cosmological constant. A possible way to understand its smallness is to imagine that it is a characteristic of a nontrivial structure of the manifold of vacua in the theory, rather than an unpredictable parameter in a simple vacuum

Symmetric cryptography and hash functions\[sct::symmetric\]
-----------------------------------------------------------

The methodology, sketched in Fig. \[fgr:flowchart\_lite\] and Fig. \[fgr:full\_algorithm\], follows the same lines as the one described in great detail in our earlier paper [@10.1007/978-3-319-69453-5_18], which we refer the interested reader to for more details.

![Analyzing an attack against a symmetric cryptographic function with a fault-tolerant quantum adversary. Our resource estimation methodology takes into account several of the layers between the high level description of an algorithm and the physical hardware required for its execution. Our approach is modular should assumptions about any of these layers change, and hence it allows one to calculate the impact of improvements in any particular layer.[]{data-label="fgr:flowchart_lite"}](figures/flowchart_lite.pdf){width="35.00000%"}

![Grover searching with an oracle for $f : \{0,1\}^k \rightarrow \{0,1\}^k$.

The Grover iteration has two subroutines. The first, $U_g$, implements the predicate $g : \{0,1\}^k
\rightarrow \{0,1\}$ that maps $x$ to $1$ if and only if $f(x) = y$. Each call to $U_g$ involves two calls to a reversible implementation of $f$ and one call to a comparison circuit that checks whether $f(x) = y$.[]{data-label="fgr:full_algorithm"}](figures/grover_vertical.pdf){width="46.00000%"}

We assume a surface-code based fault-tolerant architecture [@PhysRevA.86.032324], using Reed-Muller distillation schemes [@Fowler:2013aa]. For each scheme we vary the possible physical error rates per gate from $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-7}$. We believe that this range of physical error rates is wide enough to cover both first generation quantum computers as well as more advanced future machines. In

Additional Simulation Studies {#addl_sims}
=============================

To further evaluate the performance of our proposed procedures, we interrogate our estimators in three additional sets of simulation studies. In each scenario, we compare five variants of our inverse probability weighted estimators to an alternative unadjusted estimator that considers only $\E Y$ in the treatment group (i.e., $A = 1$). The inverse probability weighted estimators are constructed using varied selectors for the highly adaptive lasso estimator of the propensity score, including

1.  global cross-validation to choose the $L_1$-norm;

2.  undersmoothing with minimization of the cross-validated mean of $D_{\text{CAR}}$ (as per equation \[main:eq:udcar\]), with and without $\kappa$-truncation; and

3.  solving the cross-validated score-based criterion arising (from equation \[main:eq:score\]), with and withou $\kappa$-truncation.

Each of the inverse probability weighted estimators was constructed using 5-fold cross-fitting, as discussed in Section \[main:estim\_cv\]. In the sequel, we consider scenarios across which the true treatment assignment mechanism ranges from randomization to a complex function of the covariates $W$.

In the first scenario, the treatment assignment mechanism is randomized, such that the baseline covariates have no impact on the probability of receiving treatment. In the second scenario, we consider a treatment assignment mechanism that includes interaction terms between baseline covariates and in which the positivity assumption strongly holds. In the third and final scenario, we consider a treatment mechanism that includes interaction terms between baseline covariates and in which the probability of receiving treatment is extremely low for certain strata of the covariates $W$. In all sets of simulation studies, we consider estimation of $\Psi(P_0)
= \E_{P_0}\{Y(1)\}$, the counterfactual mean for having received treatment. In each scenario, $n$ independent and identically distributed observations were drawn from the given data-generating mechanism, for each of the sample sizes $n
\in \{100, 400, 900, 1600\}$. Throughout, $\epsilon \sim \text{Normal}(\mu = 0,
\sigma = 0.1)$ and $\expit(x) = \{1 + \exp(-x) \}^{-1}$. Each of the estimators is compared in terms of their raw (unscaled) bias, scaled (

$$\nabla \times\mu_r^{-1}(\nabla \times\mathbf{E})-\omega^2\varepsilon_0\mu_0(\varepsilon_r-i\sigma/\omega\varepsilon_0)\mathbf{E}=0
\label{eq1}$$

In the condition of the electric conductivity $\sigma=0$ and non-magnetic materials ($\mu_r=1$), the previous equation reduces to:

$$\nabla \times(\nabla \times\mathbf{E})-k_0\textsuperscript{2}\varepsilon_r\mathbf{E}=0
\label{eq2}$$

Here $k_0$ is the incident wavevector in vacuum or air ($k_0 = 2\pi/\lambda$), while $\varepsilon_r$ represents the material dielectric permittivity. By providing as an input the values of real and imaginary parts of the refractive index of any considered material, the software retrieves the corresponding dielectric permittivity ($\varepsilon_r$) and numerically solves Eq. \[eq2\] to obtain the $\mathbf{E}$ field distribution. Scattering parameters (S-parameter) for transmittance ($S_{21}$) and reflectance ($S_{11}$) are computed (See Supporting information).

In order to simulate the behavior of TM and TE light in a 3D environment, it is necessary to properly write the components of the electromagnetic fields with respect to the incidence plane ($xz$) and set the polarizations accordingly: $\mathbf{H}= (0,1,0)$ for TM and $\mathbf{E}=(0,1,0)$ for TE.[@lio2019comprehensive]

As we can see in Figure \[fig:2\]b, the calculated transmittance for the CMH-HMM turns out to be zero in all the considered vis-NIR regions, while the reflectance spectrum, calculated for a TM and $\theta_i = 50^\circ$, is totally modified respect to the reflectance of the HMM and the Au helix array considered separately (see Figures 1b-1d). In particular, we can distinguish three reflectance minima at 635 nm (mode A), 710 nm (mode B) and 890 nm (mode C).

It is important to note that these reflectance dips are closely related to the geometrical and material properties of the designed CMH. In fact, considering an out-of-plane 3D pillars hypergrating characterized by

The investigations carried out result in the established presence of nanocracks, predicted earlier by the authors (see [@1]), and their distribution by size on $LiYF_4$ and $LiTmF_4$ crystal surface. This seems to be of importance for both the detailed investigation of the nature of magnetic coupling between liquid $^3He$ and a solid-state substrate, on one hand, and the practical realization of a method of dynamic nuclei polarization of liquid $^3He$ with the use of the dielectric Van Vleck paramagnets. This technique was suggested by the authors in [@7]. From our results it follows that the surface of particles of finely dispersed powders is deformed in a high degree. The latter is in good correspondence with our estimates of the deformed layer part in systems of this kind (see [@8]).

We wish to express gratitude to Prof. for constant interest to our investigations, to Prof. T.Ando (Kanazawa University, Japan) for his preliminary AFM NMR investigations and to P.P Chernov for his support in the NMR investigations.

Main Assumptions
----------------

1\. The basic assumption of the SMES is that the production of new degrees of freedom during the early stage of A+A collisions is a statistical process. Thus formation of all microscopic states allowed by conservation laws is equally probable. As particle creation from energy does not produce net charges, only states with total baryon, flavor and electric charge quantum numbers equal to zero are considered. Presence of the colliding nucleons is assumed to affect the properties of the observed final state only via their interactions with the statistically produced particles during the expansion of the system. This issue is further discussed in point 5 below. Consequently, the properties of the state produced at the early stage are entirely defined by the available energy and the volume in which production takes place. In central A+A collisions this volume is chosen as the Lorentz contracted volume occupied by the colliding nucleons (participant nucleons) from a single nucleus: $$\label{volume}
V = \frac {V_0} {\gamma}~,$$ where $V_0 = \frac{4}{3} \pi r_0^3 A_p$ and $\gamma = \sqrt{s}_{NN}/(2
m_N)$, $m_N$ is the nucleon mass and $A_p$ is the number of participant nucleons from a single nucleus. The $r_0$ parameter is taken to be 1.30 fm in order to fit the mean baryon density in the nucleus, $\rho_0 = 0.11$ fm$^{-3}$.

2\. Only a fraction, $\eta$, of the total energy in A+A collision is transformed into the energy of new degrees of freedom created in the early stage. This is because a part of the energy is carried by the net baryon number which is conserved during the collision. The released (inelastic) energy can be expressed as: $$\label{energyin}
E = \eta (\sqrt{s}_{NN} - 2 m_N)~A_p~.$$ The parameter $\eta$ is assumed to be independent of the collision energy and the system size for A+A collisions. The value of $\eta$ used for the numerical calculations is 0.67 [@Ba:94].

3\. The elementary particles of strong interactions are quarks and gluons. The deconfined state is considered to be composed of $u$, $d$ and $s$ quarks and the corresponding anti-quarks each with internal number

The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. In Section \[sec:Data\], we discuss the observational data used within this work, and the selection criteria we apply to construct our sample of QSOs. In Section \[sec:Fitting\] we describe our MCMC fitting procedure, and how we model the QSO continuum, emission line features and other components to aid the estimation of the observed QSO flux. With all the data obtained from fitting our entire QSO sample, in Section \[sec:Covariance\] we construct our covariance matrix, and discuss the major correlations and recovered features. In Section \[sec:Recon\] we outline our [Ly$\alpha$]{} reconstruction method, and highlight the performance of this approach. Following this, in Section \[sec:Discussions\] we provide a discussion of the potential applications for both the MCMC fitting algorithm and the [Ly$\alpha$]{} reconstruction pipeline. Finally, in Section \[sec:Conclusions\] we finish with our closing remarks.

Data {#sec:Data}
====

In this work, we select our QSOs from Data Release 12 (DR12) [@Alam:2015p5162] of the large-scale SDSS-III observational programme BOSS [@Dawson:2013p5160]. The full details of the SDSS telescope are available in @Gunn:2006p1 and the details of the upgraded SDSS/BOSS spectrographs may be obtained in @Smee:2013p1. For reference, the wavelength coverage of the BOSS spectrograph is $3,\!600{\rm \AA} < \lambda < 10,\!400{\rm \AA}$ in the observed frame, with a resolution of $R\sim2000-2500$ corresponding to pixel resolution of $\sim120-150$ km/s. The QSO target selection for BOSS consisted of a variety of schemes, including colour and variability selection, counterparts to radio and X-ray sources, and previously known QSOs [@Bovy:2011p1; @Kirkpatrick:2011p1; @Ross:2012p1]. The candidate QSO spectra were then visually inspected following the procedure outlined in @Paris:2016p1, with updated lists of confirmed QSOs for DR12 available online[^2]. Furthermore, we use the publicly available

The results indicate that out of 12 modes, 11 are suppressed by at least factor of 10 and in some cases by more than two orders of magnitude. The relatively large discrepancy between model and measurement for mode \#2 can be explained by the AMD and TM interaction condition for this particular mode. The FEM predicts that mode \#2 will be within 500Hz of the AMD Fy-mode at 10 kHz, while the measured values give a separation of 800Hz (mostly due to the AMD resonance being off), reducing the interaction between the AMD and TM mode.

In the off-resonance interactions, which are more common and set the lower limit to AMD performance, the discrepancy is generally less than a factor of a few.

Surprisingly, modes \#2 and \#6 show a counterintuitive behavior; opening the resistive circuit of the AMDs to decreases the TMAM Q-factor. However, since electrical circuit of AMD affects mechanical stiffness of the shear plates it is expected that principle resonances also changed when the circuit is opened. Also, if the AMD resonance is close to the TMAM frequency, equation \[eq:qeff\] indicates that the mode Q can be decreased by *lowering* the AMD loss.

The large Q reduction for modes \#3 and \#4 is due the on-resonance interaction between TMAM and AMD, whereas for modes \#5 and \#12 the large Q reduction is due to the anti-node AMD location on the TMAM.

For a cycle [$\smash{{\mathscr{C}}}$]{} we write [$\smash{\operatorname{len}({\mathscr{C}})}$]{} for the length (number of edges) of [$\smash{{\mathscr{C}}}$]{}; when [$\smash{\operatorname{len}({\mathscr{C}})=k}$]{} we refer to [$\smash{{\mathscr{C}}}$]{} as a [$\smash{k}$]{}-cycle. We write [$\smash{\operatorname{wgt}({\mathscr{C}})}$]{} for its total weight, and $$\label{e:c.bar}
    {\bar{c}}({\mathscr{C}})\equiv n\operatorname{wgt}({\mathscr{C}})/\operatorname{len}({\mathscr{C}})$$ for its mean weight scaled by [$\smash{n}$]{}; we say [$\smash{{\mathscr{C}}}$]{} is *[$\smash{c}$]{}-light* if [$\smash{{\bar{c}}({\mathscr{C}})\le c}$]{}. We apply these terms to paths as well as cycles; note that a [$\smash{k}$]{}-cycle involves [$\smash{k}$]{} vertices while a [$\smash{k}$]{}-path involves [$\smash{k+1}$]{} vertices. To treat both undirected and directed random networks in a fairly unified manner, we will always take cycles and paths to be directed. In our random network, the weight of any given [$\smash{k}$]{}-cycle or [$\smash{k}$]{}-path is distributed as the sum of [$\smash{k}$]{} independent unit-rate exponential

For us $I=\{0,1,2,3,\ldots,n\}$ are the labels of the affine Dynkin diagram. In the following we will also consider the subalgebras $X_n$ with Dynkin set $I_{X_n} = \{1,2,3,\ldots,n\}$, $X_{n-1}$ with Dynkin set $I_{X_{n-1}} = \{2,3,\ldots,n\}$, and $X_{n-2}$ with Dynkin set $I_{X_{n-2}} = \{3,4,\ldots,n\}$. Since $e_i$ with $i\in I_{X_{n-2}}$ commutes with both $e_0$ and $e_1$, it suffices to prove the commutativity of $e_0$ and $e_1$ for $X_{n-2}$ highest weight vectors. As we have seen in section \[ss:bij\], the $X_{n-1}$-highest weight elements in the branching $X_n\to X_{n-1}$ can be described by $\pm$ diagrams. Similarly the $X_{n-2}$-highest weight elements in the branching $X_{n-1}\to X_{n-2}$ can be described by $\pm$ diagrams. Hence each $X_{n-2}$-highest weight vector is uniquely determined by a pair of $\pm$ diagrams $(P,p)$ such that ${\mathrm{inner}}(P)={\mathrm{outer}}(p)$. The diagram $P$ specifies the $X_{n-1}$-component $B_{X_{n-1}}({\mathrm{inner}}(P))$ in $B_{X_n}({\mathrm{outer}}(P))$, and $p$ specifies the $X_{n-2}$ component inside $B_{X_{n-1}}({\mathrm{inner}}(P))$. Let $\Psi$ denote the map $(P,p) \mapsto b$ from a pair of $\pm$ diagrams to a $X_{n-2}$ highest weight vector.

\[ex:Psi\] The tableau $b\in B^{4,3}$ of type $D_6^{(1)}$ corresponding to $$P=\young(-,+,{\text{}}+-,{\text{}}{\text{}}{\text{}}) \quad \text{and} \quad
p=\young(-,{\text{}}{\text{}}+) \quad \text{is}

The approximate evaluation of (\[eq:Zeff\]) goes in general as follows. One expands the action $S_{eff}[B]$ as a power series in the fluctuations ${\cal B} = B - \overline{B}$ around its stationary value $S_{eff}[\overline{B}]$. The mean field $\overline{B}$ is a solution to the variational Euler-Lagrange equations, $$\delta \,S_{eff}[B] = 0.
\label{eq:EuLa}$$ Writing $$S_{eff}[B] =  S_{eff}[\overline{B}] + S_{fl}[{\cal B}]
\label{eq:sadl1}$$ one can then write, $$Z = Z_{0} < \exp \left \{ - S_{fl}[{\cal B}] \right \}>_{0}\;, Z_{0} = \exp \left \{-S_{eff}[\overline{B}]\right \},
\label{eq:sadl2}$$ where the symbol $<...>_{0}$ stands for average value with respect to $S_{eff}[\overline{B}]$. In this method, the saddle point contribution is treated exactly, while the effects of the fluctuations around $\overline{B}$, are treated perturbatively, to the desired accuracy.

If the replacement of a fermionic integral with a bosonic one is succesfully carried out along the lines indicated above, then the bosonic fields $\overline{B}$ ought to describe macroscopic structures, or phases, of the interacting fermionic system, such as ferromagnetism, superconductivity and so on, for interacting electron systems. The effects of fluctuations $$< \exp \left \{ - S_{fl}[{\cal B}] \right \}>_{0}
\label{eq:fluct2}$$ ought to give rise to small perturbative corrections only, to the underlying structure of the system described by the field $\overline{B}$. If one can ignore effects of fluctuations, then the partition function $Z$ of the interacting fermion system is approximated by $Z_{0}$, and one says that the system is described in the mean field approximation represented by the field $\overline{B}$.

It was already mentioned above, that in general there may exist several realisations of fields $B$ by means of which one transforms the functional integral (\[eq:partfZ\]) into the equivalent form (\[eq:HSpartfZ\]). Hence, in the same fermionic system, one

We illustrate several of the matches given in Table \[tab3\] in Fig. \[fig1\] and Fig. \[fig2\]. The ratios $\alpha(\lambda)/m$ of frequency-dependent polarizabilities to the atomic weights for Li and Na in the wavelength range 500-800 nm are plotted in Fig. \[fig1\]. The corresponding matches are shown by the arrows and the corresponding wavelengths are given on the plot. The values $\frac{\alpha}{m}$ for $^6$Li and $^{23}$Na match at three wavelengths in the wavelength range plotted on Fig. \[fig1\]. Two of the matches, at 589.397 nm and 670.79 nm, are very close to the resonances and, therefore, are not listed in Table \[tab3\] as discussed before. The match areas for those cases are extremely narrow and the polarizability of the corresponding alkali is very sensitive to very small changes in the wavelength. Fig. \[fig2\] shows similar plot to illustrate the wavelengths at which $^{40}$K and $^{87}$Rb have the same frequencies of oscillation in a common optical trap in the range 740-820 nm.

Conclusions
===========

In summary, we conducted a systematic study of the ground state frequency-dependent polarizabilities of the alkali atoms from ultraviolet through infrared spectral regions. The values of the ac polarizabilities and their uncertainties are calculated for a number of wavelengths, including the wavelengths of common infrared lasers. A combination of high-precision measurements of the ratios of frequency-dependent polarizabilities of different species could provide excellent tests of the current experimental and theoretical values of the electric-dipole matrix elements in alkali-metal atoms. We provide formulas and the necessary parameters for the accurate calculation of the ac polarizabilities for all alkali-metal atoms at wavelengths above 800 nm. Finally, we list selected wavelengths at which two species of alkali atoms would have the same oscillation frequencies in a common optical trap.\

The description of collective bound states can be facilitated if we introduce, as it was discussed above, the set of bosonic variables and pass to the semi-bosonized effective meson action which is responsible for the $\tau \to f_1\, \pi^{-} \nu_{\tau}$ decay, namely, the part which describes both the interactions of the ground pseudoscalar $\pi^{\pm}$, axial-vector $a_1^{\pm}(1260)$, $f_1(1285)$ mesons and their first radially excited states with light constituent quarks. In momentum representation the action takes the form $$\begin{aligned}
\label{Lagrangiane}
S &=&\!\int\!\frac{d^4p}{(2\pi )^4}\bar q(p) \left(\hat p-m \right)q(p)+ \Delta S_{mass}+ \Delta S_{int}, \nonumber \\
\Delta S_{int} &=&\! \int\!\frac{d^4p}{(2\pi )^4}\!\int\!\frac{d^4k}{(2\pi )^4}\, \bar{q}\left(k+\frac{p}{2}\right) \nonumber \\
&\times& \left[ \frac{1}{2} \gamma^{\mu}\gamma^{5}\left(A_{f_{1}}f_{1\mu}(p) + B_{f_{1}}f^{'}_{1\mu}(p)\right) \right.\nonumber \\
&+& \frac{1}{2} \gamma^{\mu}\gamma^{5} \vec\tau \left(A_{a_{1}}\vec a_{1\mu}(p) + B_{a_{1}}\vec a'_{1\mu}(p)\right) \nonumber \\
&+&  \left. \gamma^{5} \vec\tau \left(A_{\pi}\vec \pi (p) + B_{\pi}\vec \pi'\right)\right]q\left(k-\frac{p}{2}\right) .\end{aligned}$$ We shall not discuss here the mass part of the action $\Delta S_{mass}$ (see, for instance, [@Volkov17] or references therein). Our notations are as follows: $f_{1\mu}$, $\vec a_{1\mu}$ and $\vec \pi $ are the fields corresponding to the axial-vector and pseudoscal

In the TR scenario, when the FAT is smaller than the response time $t_0$, the probability density of FAT is still $P(t)$; however, when the FAT is larger than $t_0$, this probability density becomes $P_{\alpha}(t)=\big{(}1-(1-(1-\alpha)\omega)^{I_{x}(t)}\big{)}\prod_{0<t_{i}<t_{0}}(1-\omega)^{I_{x}(t_{i})}\prod_{t_{0}\le t_{j}<t}\big{(}1-(1-\alpha)\omega)^{I_{x}(t_{j})}\simeq(1-\alpha)\omega\exp[\lambda t-(1-\alpha)\omega\exp(\lambda t)/\lambda
-\alpha\omega\exp(\lambda t_{0})/\lambda]$. We numerically calculate the average FAT through $<\!t_{\alpha}^{F}\!>=\!\int_0^{t_0}\tau P(\tau)d\tau+\int_{t_{0}}^{\infty}\tau P_\alpha(\tau)d\tau$, and get the delay of FAT, $\Delta t(\alpha)$, by solving $$\Delta t(\alpha)=<\!t^{F}_{\alpha}\!>-<\!t^{F}\!>.\label{eq.2}$$ If the response time $t_0$ is negligible ($t_0\!=\!0$), Eq.(\[eq.2\]) is simplified as $$\Delta t(\alpha)|_{t_{0}=0}\!=\!-\ln(1-\alpha)/\lambda,\label{eq.3}$$ which recovers the results obtained by the cumulative probability $P(t^{y}\leq t)$ in Refs. [@PLoSONE6e16591; @MB21470]. Note that Eq (\[eq.3\]) is independent from the values of $\omega,N$. With $\lambda$=0.25, unless the intensity $\alpha$ is increased to an unpractically high level ($\alpha>0.97$), $\Delta t(\alpha)$ cannot be longer than 2 weeks.

To study the PI scenario, we first consider the case where the FAT is larger than $t_0$. At this early stage, we still have the approximation $I_x(t_{i})\!\simeq\!\exp(\lambda t_{i})$ when time $t_i\!\le\!t_0

To a Riemann surface with boundary $(X,\d X)$, we can canonically construct the double via the Schwartz reflection through the boundary. The double $D(X,\d X)$ of $(X,\d X)$ is a compact Riemann surface. The doubled genus of $(X,\d X)$ is defined to be the usual genus of $D(X,\d X)$.

On a Riemann surface with boundary $(X,\d X)$, we consider two types of marked points. The markings of interior type are points of $X\backslash\d X$. The markings of boundary type are points of $\d X$. Let ${\mathcal M}_{g,k,l}$ denote the moduli space of Riemann surfaces with boundary of doubled genus $g$ with $k$ distinct boundary markings and $l$ distinct interior markings. The moduli space ${\mathcal M}_{g,k,l}$ is defined to be empty unless the stability condition $$2g-2+k+2l>0$$ is satisfied. The moduli space ${\mathcal M}_{g,k,l}$ is a real orbifold of real dimension $3g-3+k+2l$.

The cotangent line classes $\psi_i\in H^2({\mathcal M}_{g,k,l};{\mathbb C})$ are defined (as before) as the first Chern classes of the cotangent line bundles associated to the interior markings. In [@PST14], cotangent lines at the boundary points are not considered. Open intersection numbers are defined by $$\begin{gathered}
\label{eq: open intersections}
\left<\tau_{a_1}\tau_{a_2}\ldots\tau_{a_l}\sigma^k\right>^o_g:=\int_{{\overline{\mathcal M}}_{g,k,l}}\psi_1^{a_1}\psi_2^{a_2}\ldots\psi_l^{a_l}.\end{gathered}$$ To rigorously define the right-hand side of , at least three significant steps must be taken:

-   A natural compactification ${\mathcal M}_{g,k,l}\subset{\overline{\mathcal M}}_{g,k,l}$ must be constructed. Candidates for ${\overline{\mathcal M}}_{g,k,l}$ are themselves real orbifolds with boundary $\d{\overline{\mathcal M}}_{g,k,l}$;

What we are going to shortly discuss in the present contribution is set in this last perspective and suggests a semiclassical approach to define WKB quantum states for spherically symmetric shells. This method has already been used in [@bib:ClQuG2002..19..6321A].

Let us then consider a spherical shell (we refer the reader to [@bib:PhReD1991..43..1129I] for very concise/clear background material and for definitions). For our purpose the relevant result is equation (4) in [@bib:PhReD1991..43..1129I], i.e. the junction conditions[^2] $
    K ^{-} _{ij} - K ^{+} _{ij} \propto S _{ij} - g _{ij} S / 2
    .
$ $K _{ij}$ is the extrinsic curvature of the shell and can have different values on the two sides ($+$ and $-$ spacetime regions) of it. $S _{ij}$ is the stress energy tensor describing the energy/matter content of the shell ($S$ is its trace). For a spherical shell these equations reduce to the single condition $$\epsilon _{-} ( \dot{R} ^{2} + f _{-} (R) ) ^{1/2}
    -
    \epsilon _{+} ( \dot{R} ^{2} + f _{+} (R) ) ^{1/2}
    =
    M (R) / R
    ,
\label{eq:sphjuncon}$$ where $f _{\pm} (r)$ are the metric functions in the static coordinate systems adapted to the spherical symmetry of the $4$-dimensional spacetime regions joined across the shell; $\epsilon _{\pm} =  +1, -1$ are signs and $R$ and $M (R)$ are the the radius (a function of the proper time $\tau$ of a co-moving observer[^3]) and the matter content (what remains of $S _{ij}$) of the spherical shell, respectively. As shown for example in [@bib:NuPhB1990.339...417G; @bib:ClQuG1997..14..2727S; @bib:Thes.1994....TriestA] the above equation can be obtained from an effective Lagrangian[^4] $L _{\mathrm{EFF}} (R , \dot{R})$, as a first integral of the second order Euler-Lagrange

Microscopic considerations
--------------------------

As mentioned in the introduction, the gauge field ${\bf a}$ has no dynamics in the original U(1) microscopic model, as it only serves to enforce a constraint on spinons and holons. The stiffness term (\[fgauge\]) in the effective theory was assumed to arise in the process of integrating out the microscopic degrees of freedom[@sachdev1; @lee3]. While such term is certainly permitted by symmetry, assessing its strength $\sigma$ is a nontrivial issue since even deep in the superconducting phase neither holons nor spinons are truly gapped. Thus, in general, integrating out these degrees of freedom may lead to singular and nonlocal interactions between the condensate and the gauge fields. To our knowledge the procedure has not been explicitly performed for the U(1) model and the precise form or magnitude of the gauge stiffness term is unknown. General considerations[@nayak1] suggest that the gauge stiffness term is negligible in the class of models with exact local U(1) symmetry connecting the phases of holons and spinons.

Consider now an intermediate representation of the problem where only high energy microscopic degrees of freedom have been integrated out. In the presence of a cutoff this is a well defined procedure even for gapless excitations, as explicitly shown by Kwon and Dorsey[@kwon1] for a simple BCS model. The corresponding effective Lagrangian density of the present U(1) model can be written as $$\begin{aligned}
{\cal L}_{\rm eff}&=&
{\kappa_\Delta^\mu\over 2}(\partial_\mu\phi-2a_\mu)^2
+{\kappa_b^\mu\over 2}(\partial_\mu\theta-a_\mu-eA_\mu)^2
-f_{\rm amp} \nonumber \\
&+&(\partial_\mu\phi-2a_\mu)J_{\rm sp}^\mu
+(\partial_\mu\theta-a_\mu-eA_\mu)J_h^\mu \nonumber \\ 
&+&{\cal L}_{\rm sp}[\psi_{\rm sp},\psi_{\rm sp}^\dagger;\rho_\Delta]
+{\cal L}_h[\psi_h,\psi_h^\dagger;\rho_b] +{\cal L}_{\rm EM}[A_\mu].
\label{leff}\end{aligned}$$ The Greek index $\mu$ runs over time and two spatial dimensions, $\kappa_i^0$ are

The following theorem, whose proof is essentially due to B. Weiss [@weiss2001], shows that the class of groups admitting computable normal F[ø]{}lner monotilings is closed under group extensions.

\[thm.weiss\] Let $$1 \to (E,\imath_E) \overset{\id}{\to} (F,\imath_F) \overset{\psi}{\to} (G,\imath_G) \to 1$$ be an exact sequence of computable groups such that $\id, \psi$ are computable homomorphisms. Suppose that $([E_k,\calQ_k])_{k \geq 1}, ([G_m,\calS_m])_{m \geq 1}$ are computable normal F[ø]{}lner monotilings of the groups $(E,\imath_E)$ and $(G,\imath_G)$ respectively. Then there is a computable normal F[ø]{}lner monotiling $([F_l,\calR_l])_{l \geq 1}$ in the group $(F,\imath_F)$.

We begin by describing an auxiliary construction that provides us with ‘computable’ sections of computable sets in $F$ over $G$. Let $T \subseteq F$ be a computable set. Let ${\mathbf{1}_{T}}$ be the characteristic function of $T$. Now we construct a characteristic function of a computable section $T'$ of $T$ as follows: $${\mathbf{1}_{T'}}(n) :=  \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if } {\mathbf{1}_{T}}(n)=1 \text{ and } ((\forall \ l < n \ \ \psi(n)\neq \psi(l)) \vee (n=\ue));\\
    0 &  \text{otherwise.}
  \end{cases}$$ That is, $T'$ is the set of the first members of each $E$-coset in $T$ except for the coset $\ue E$, on which we pick $\ue$ instead if $\ue \in T$. Since the functions ${\mathbf{1}_{T}}, \psi$ are computable, it is easy to see that ${\mathbf{1}_{T'}}$ is computable as well. In particular, the function $x \mapsto \psi^{-1}(x)'$ from $G$ to $F$ is computable

In general, by Lemma \[assum\], $e_1\bar x_1^{2n+1}e_1=\sum_{j=0}^n a_{2n+1, j} e_1 x_1^{2j+1}e_1$. So, $\bar \omega_{2n+1}=\sum_{j=0}^n a_{2n+1, j} \omega_{2j+1}$. Similarly, by Lemma \[assum1\] and Definition \[awbsa\](6), $\bar \omega_{2n}=\sum_{j=0}^n a_{2n, j} \omega_{2j}=0$.

\[admis-para\]From here onwards, we always assume that $\bar \omega_{2n}=0$ and $\bar \omega_{2n+1}$

Kinematical analysis
====================

As the existence of young objects at large distances from the star forming regions of the Galactic disk is potentially interesting, we have performed a kinematical analysis for PG 1002+506. Although no proper motion information is available, it is possible to use the observed radial velocity of a star to constrain its evolutionary history. A detailed description of the method of analysis is given by Rolleston et al. (1997).

We first consider a scenario whereby PG 1002+506 has a zero velocity component parallel to the Galactic disk, and ejection has occurred perpendicular to the plane of the Galaxy. We have corrected the observed heliocentric velocity for the effects of differential rotation (Fich et al. 1989), assuming that the halo co-rotates with the disk, to determine the stellar radial motion $(v_r)$ with respect to a standard of rest defined by its local environment. Our initial assumption implies that the observed radial velocity is a component of the stellar space motion $(v_z)$ perpendicular to the disk. We then attempt to show that PG 1002+506 could have reached its present position in the Galactic halo within its evolutionary lifetime, while reproducing the observed radial velocity, and calculating the required ejection velocity. These calculations have adopted the gravitational potential function of House & Kilkenny (1980). This analysis implicitly assumes that the star is ejected from the disk shortly after birth, consistent with cluster ejection simulations.

The results of the kinematical analysis are given in Table 1. Given the large z-distance, it is not surprising to find the “time of flight” to be larger than the evolutionary age. We have therefore considered the effects of errors in the derived atmospheric parameters and the radial velocity measurement. By optimizing the values of $T_{\rm eff}$ and $\log
g$ such that they are self-consistent within the errors, it is possible to increase the evolutionary age, so that it is greater than the predicted flight time. For example, adopting values of $T_{\rm eff} = 13,750$ K and $\log g = 4.0$ would imply an age of 115 Myr for a mass of 4.0 $M_{\odot}.$ Allowing an error of 15 km s$^{-1}$ in the observed heliocentric velocity also decreases the estimated flight time, but not significantly, to 84 Myr.

Conclusions
===========

PG 1002+506 appears to be a young, rapidly rotating B5Ve star at a

The trigger of the camera comprises two stages. In the first stage, the signals of nine channels are summed. This sum-signal is clipped to suppress effects of baseline fluctuations in case of high noise conditions. A comparator converts this signal into a a digital signal. Four of these signals are again summed and discriminated slightly below the threshold for a single input signal. This second step mainly reduces fake triggers from noise of the electronics itself by suppressing too short trigger signals.

Changing the comparator thresholds, the dependence of the total trigger rate on the threshold settings can be investigated. For low thresholds the rate is dominated by noise and photons from the diffuse night-sky background. For high thresholds, random triggers by artificial coincidences are suppressed, and only simultaneously arriving photons from cosmic-ray induced showers will trigger the system.

#### Results

For rates above 10MHz, the system saturates. Below, the trigger rate is dominated by random coincidences of night-sky background photons turning into triggers caused by coincident photons from cosmic-ray induced showers.

To prove the stability of the gain over a longer time-period and its independence of the ambient light condition, several ratescans have been taken between March and July 2012 with changing light conditions. Fig. \[fig:Ratescans0V\] shows 26 ratescans taken with light conditions ranging from dark night to almost full moon ($\approx 90\%$). It is visible that the shower induced part of the curves is independent of the ambient light conditions corresponding to a stable gain.

More on measured current, light condition, trigger threshold and rate can be found in [@bib:threshold; @bib:ratescans; @bib:moon].

Conclusion
==========

The camera of the FACT telescope is now operated since 20 months and has proven the applicability of silicon photo sensors in real-life focal plane installations, in particular, in Cherenkov telescopes.

To achieve a stable operation, of the applied Geiger-mode avalanche photo diodes, a feedback system adapting the applied voltage according to temperature readings and the measured current has been developed.

Three different methods to measure the gain of the system directly or indirectly were applied. They show consistent results on gain-stability. The presented results are limited by the calibration procedure of the bias voltage system, which is currently improved. The most precise and direct method, the extraction of the dark count spectrum, has shown a long-term stability over several months under changing temperature conditions at the few percent level

abstract: 'The finite time end of entanglement between two decohering qubits can be modified by local, unitary actions performed during the decoherence process. Depending on the time when such action is taken, the end can be speeded up or slowed down, or even averted all together. This phenomenon offers practical applications for the stabilization of entangled quantum states. Details concerning hastening or delaying the finite time end of entanglement are presented for two qubits which decay spontaneously into statistically independent reservoirs.'

title: 'Hastening, delaying, or averting sudden death of quantum entanglement'
---

Entanglement is a key feature of the quantum physics of more than one particle. From its historical beginnings [@EPR] to the current practical interest in it as a core resource for the field of quantum information sciences [@Nielsen], this property of quantum systems continues to fascinate and to shed new light onto the nature of our quantum world. The fields of quantum computing, quantum cryptography and key distribution [@QKD], and quantum teleportation[@teleport] all rely on having entangled states of two qubits. Since each qubit is inevitably subject to decoherence and decay processes, no matter how much they may be screened from the external environment, it is important to consider possible degradation of any initially established entanglement. In particular, there has been increasing discussion of what has been called “sudden death", a finite time when the entanglement disappears even under decoherence mechanisms which may be only asymptotic in time [@end; @Eberly; @Almeida]. Clearly, such finite time disappearance of entanglement can seriously affect its application in any of the above fields.

It is well known in the context of spontaneous emission processes [@spontaneous] or delayed choice experiments [@delayed], for example, that characteristic quantum phenomena and effects of decoherence can be influenced significantly by suitable actions, such as measurements. Therefore, it would be of interest if A(lice) and B(ob), the two members of the entangled pair, can take suitable individual actions when faced with the prospect of loss of entanglement to postpone that end. Some studies on changing the initial state into an equivalently entangled but more robust state have been carried out [@initialization]. In this Letter, we deal with the more direct question that, even given an initial state and a set up which will

The highest exponent, $E$, was kept constant in each stage of the experiment and all other exponents were taken as random numbers between $0$ and $E$. All other parameters such as number of clauses, maximum number of terms and the number of variables were kept constant. The experiment was performed for both, a 2 variable case and a 3 variable case. The increase in the running time was observed to closely mimic Fig. 1, as shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.\
This increase is expected as an increase in the exponent results in an increase in the number of regions, when the construction phase of CAD reaches the variable with the exponent $E$. This is leads to an almost exponential increase in the number of regions, as each previously generated region spawns more regions in the higher dimensions. This would result in a stark increase in running time.

One can conclude that number of terms and exponents contribute equally to the running time of CAD.

This was conducted for a 2 variable case, with a maximum of $5$ terms per polynomial and a maximum of 2 polynomials per clause. The number of clauses was varied from $2$ to $6$. The results were averaged over 50 randomly generated prenex formulae. An almost exponential increase is observed in this case, as shown in Fig. 4.

One could infer from this decrease in gradient that the total number of terms in a collection of projected polynomials depends to a greater extent on the number of terms per polynomial, than on the number of polynomials.

On Validity of the Preprocessor
-------------------------------

As the analysis is performed on the assumption that the input is in the CNF format, with each prenex formula containing two or more clauses, it is necessary to give an account on the percentage of randomly generated prenex formulae, that can be converted to a CNF containing more than one clause. A CNF is a conjunctive normal form with universally quantified variables. Hence, 100 prenex formulae were randomly generated, which do not conform to the normal form defined previously. They were subjected to a logic converter, which converts them to a minimal conjunctive normal form. We have observed the following from the plot in Fig. 5: only 8% of the formulae were 1-separable. Hence, in 92% of the cases, the algorithm would lead to a parallel execution of CAD.\

By a classical theorem by K. Kodaira and D. C. Spencer, [@kodaira-spencer-3 Theorem 15], small deformations of compact complex manifolds admitting a Kähler metric still admit Kähler metrics. This is a consequence of the harmonicity property of Kähler metrics and of Hodge theory on compact Kähler manifolds. On the other side, H. Hironaka provided in [@hironaka] an example of a complex-analytic family of compact complex manifolds being Kähler except as for the central fibre, which is only Moǐšhezon. In other words, Kählerness is not a closed property under deformations. It is expected that limits of projective manifolds are Moǐšhezon, and limits of Kähler manifolds are in class $\mathcal{C}$ of Fujiki, see [@demailly-paun; @popovici-invent]. Note that $\partial\overline\partial$-Lemma is an invariant property under images of holomorphic birational maps, [@deligne-griffiths-morgan-sullivan Theorem 5.22]. In particular, compact complex manifolds being Moǐšhezon or belonging to class $\mathcal{C}$ of Fujiki satisfy the $\partial\overline\partial$-Lemma, [@deligne-griffiths-morgan-sullivan Corollary 5.23]. Hence, in view of the above conjectures, in [@angella-kasuya-2; @angella-tomassini-3], the behaviour of the $\partial\overline\partial$-Lemma property under deformation is investigated. In particular, [@angella-tomassini-3 Corollary 2.7] provides another argument for proving the stability of $\partial\overline\partial$-Lemma under small deformations; see the references therein for different proofs. While, in [@angella-kasuya-2 §4, Corollary 6.1], it is provided an example showing that $\partial\overline\partial$-Lemma is not stable under limits. Note in fact that the structures on the holomorphically-parallelizable Nakamura manifold studied in [@angella-kasuya-2 §4] are not in class $\mathcal{C}$ of Fujiki. In any case, nilmanifolds and solvmanifolds (that is, compact quotients of connected simply-connected nilpotent, respectively solvable, Lie groups by co-compact discrete subgroups,) provide a possibly useful class of examples for investigating the above

The medium effects are introduced via a specific evolving self energy of the vector meson. A simple self energy $$\begin{aligned}
            \Sigma^{\text{ret}}(\omega,\tau)=-i\omega\Gamma(\tau)\text{,}
        \end{aligned}$$ with a $\textbf{k}$- and $\omega$-independent width $\Gamma$, leads to a Breit-Wigner distribution for the spectral function. The time dependence is being accounted for by introduction of the parameter $\tau$. For the $\textbf{k}=0$ mode, the full self energy for coupling to $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^-$ -resonances is given by $$\begin{aligned}
            \Sigma_T(\omega,\textbf{k}=0)=\frac{\rho}{2}
            \left(\frac{f_{RN\rho}}{m_{\rho}}\right)^2 g_I
            \frac{\omega^2 \bar{E}}{(\omega+\frac{i}{2}\Gamma_R)^2-\bar{E}^2}-i\omega\Gamma
            \label{modelshenself}\text{,}
        \end{aligned}$$ with $\bar{E}=\sqrt{m_R^2+\textbf{k}^2}-m_N$ and $m_R$ and $m_N$ the masses of the resonance and the nucleon respectively. $\Gamma_R$ is the width of the resonance and $g_I$ the isospin factor [@po04]. For our purpose it suffices to retain the part of the self energy that creates the pole structure. We will neglect the $\omega^2$ in the numerator because it causes straightforward dispersion relations to become invalid (subtracted dispersion relations are needed in this case). We will shorten $\left(\frac{f_{RN\rho}}{m_{\rho}}\right)^2 g_I/2~\omega^2$, with $\omega^2=1 \text{GeV}^2$ by $C$, a dimensionless factor.

Investigating which contributions in equation (\[sigmalessrate\]) come from which times in the past, shows that there are contributions from early times as well as alternating positive and negative contributions. An interpretation of this becomes difficult and it follows that only

-   if $\Theta(\phi)$ is an isotropic vector, then there exists a birational morphism $\eta\colon S\to Y$ such that $\eta\circ\phi\circ\eta^{-1}$ is an automorphism of $Y$.

Then <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Diller</span> and <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Favre</span> prove the following statement:

\[thm:blablabla\] Let $\phi\in\mathrm{Bir}(S)$ $($resp. $\psi\in\mathrm{Bir}(\widetilde{S}))$ be an algebraically stable map of a complex projective surface $S$ $($resp. $\widetilde{S})$. Assume that $\phi$ and $\psi$ are conjugate via a proper modification. Suppose that $\lambda(\phi)>1$ $($or equivalently that $\lambda(\psi)>1)$. Then $\Theta(\phi)\cdot\Theta(\phi)=0$ if and only if $\Theta(\psi)\cdot\Theta(\psi)=0$.

Theorem \[thm:blabla\] follows from Theorems \[thm:diamond\] and \[thm:blablabla\].

#### A second answer

The following statement gives another characterization of birational maps conjugate to an automorphism of a smooth projective rational surface:

\[thm:fleur\] Let $\phi$ be a birational map of a complex projective surface $S$.

-   If $\lambda(\phi)$ is a <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Salem</span> number, then there exists a birational map $\psi\colon\widetilde{S}\dashrightarrow S$ that conjugates $\phi$ to an automorphism of $\widetilde{S}$;

-   if $\phi$ is conjugate to an automorphism, then $\lambda(\phi)$ is a quadratic integer or a <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Salem</span> number.

Assume that $\lambda(\phi)$ is a <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Salem</span> number. Denote by $P(t)\in\mathbb{Z}[t]$ the minimal polynomial of $\lambda(\phi)$. But $\lambda(\phi)$ is a <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Salem</span> number so there exists a root of $P$ with modulus $1

We obtain important relations by taking the variation of the basic identities Eq.(\[eq:identity\]).

First, we take the variation of the both sides of $\d_{mn}=\<1{\>_{}}_{mn}$. Then, with the help of Eq.(\[eq:d&lt;A&gt;\]), we get $$\begin{aligned}
0= \frac{1}{2}\<g\cdot \d g {\>_{}}_{mn} +  \mu_{mn} +  \mu_{nm}   \ \ ,     \end{aligned}$$ which implies an identity, $$\<g\cdot \d g {\>_{}}_{mn} = -2 (\mu_{mn} +  \mu_{nm}) \ \ .
\label{eq:<gdg>1}$$ Thus, with the help of Eq.(\[eq:mu\]), we get $$\<g\cdot \d g {\>_{}}_{mn}
         = -\frac{2}{\l_m - \l_n}
          (\<\d \Delta {\>_{}}_{mn}-\<\d \Delta {\>_{}}_{nm})\ \ {\rm for}\ \ 
                                  m \neq n \ \ .
\label{eq:<gdg>2}$$ On the other hand, no condition is imposed on $\<g\cdot \d g {\>_{}}_{n}$ except for $$\<g\cdot \d g\>_{{}_{0}}= 2 \frac{\d V}{V}\ \ ,
\label{eq:<gdg>0}$$ which follows by an independent argument (see [*Appendix*]{} \[section:Appendix A\]).

Now we take the variation of the both sides of $\d_{mn}=\<g_{ab}{\>_{}}_{mn}$ for $m,n \geq 1$. Then, with the help of Eq.(\[eq:d&lt;Aab&gt;\]), we get $$0= - \<\overline{\d g}_{ab}{\>_{}}_{mn} - (\d \ln \l_n)  \d_{mn}
    + \sqrt{\frac{\l_m}{\l_n}}\ \mu_{mn}
    + \sqrt{\frac{\l_n}{\l_m}}\ \mu_{nm} \ \ ,$$ where $\overline{A}_{ab}:= A_{ab}-\frac{1}{2}A_\cdot^{\ \cdot} g_{ab}$  for any

The following sections are organized as follows: In Sec. \[sec:fw\_methodology\] we discuss the methodology for multipole extraction with the AMIAS and the inclusion of parameters with known uncertainties. In Sec. \[sec:fw\_pseudo\] we detail the creation of pion photoproduction pseudodata of predetermined statistical precision. The multipole content of those pseudodata is derived in Sec. \[sec:fw\_results\] validating the methodology described in Sec. \[sec:fw\_methodology\]. In Sec. \[sec:fw\_bates\] we apply the same methodology for a re-analysis of the Bates/Mainz electroproduction data [@sparveris2005investigation] measured at $Q^2=0.127$ $GeV^2/c^2$ and $W=1232$ $MeV$. Concluding remarks are given in Sec. \[sec:fw\_conclusions\].

Methodology {#sec:fw_methodology}
===========

The methodology employed is the implementation of the Chew, Goldenberg, Low and Nambu (CGLN) theoretical framework [@chew1957relativistic] for single energy multipole analyses in the Athens Model Independent Analysis Scheme (AMIAS) [@stiliaris2007multipole; @papanicolas2012novel]. The AMIAS method is based on statistical concepts and relies heavily on Monte Carlo and simulation techniques, and it thus requires High Performance Computing as it is computationally intensive. The method identifies and determines with maximal precision parameters that are sensitive to the data by yielding their Probability Distribution Functions (PDF). The AMIAS is computationally robust and numerically stable. It has been successfully applied in the analysis of data from nucleon photo-and electroproduction resonance [@markou1; @stiliaris2007multipole; @RevModPhys.84.1231], lattice QCD simulations [@alexandrou2015novel] and medical imaging [@loizospseudo].

AMIAS requires that the parameters to be extracted from the experimental data are explicitly linked via a theory or a model [@stiliaris2007multipole]. In the case of pion photoproduction this requirement is provided by the CGLN theory as in ref. [@markou1] and in the case of electroproduction as in ref. [@stiliaris2007multipole]. The multipoles are connected to the pion photoproduction observables via the CGLN [@chew1957relativistic

Consider the $\star$, the Moyal star product [@Guralnik:2001pv] $$f(z)\star g(z)=e^{i\theta_{56}\partial_5\partial_{6'}}f(z)g(z')|_{z'\to z},$$ where $z=(y_5,y_6)$ are the extra dimensional coordinates while $z$ and $z'$ are independent variables.

This is just a phase $\beta_\star$ and can be reabsorbed through a gauge transformation $$\Psi(x,y_5,y_6)\to e^{-i\tilde{\beta}_*^b(y_5,y_6)T_b}\star\Psi(x,y_5,y_6)=\tilde{\Psi}(x,y_5,y_6),$$ where $\tilde{\beta}_*^b$ is chosen to cancel the phase and it need not be equal to $\beta_*^b$ since the phases are mutiplied with the non trivial Moyal product. The gauge fields transform as $$A_{5,6}\to \tilde{A}_{5,6}+(\partial_{5,6} e^{i\beta_\star^bT_b})\star e^{-i\tilde{\beta}_*^b(y_5,y_6)T_b},$$ which after compactification is just a constant and behaves like an effective 4d constant VEV $$\braket{A_{5,6}}=\int dy^2 (\partial_{5,6} e^{i\beta_\star^bT_b})\star e^{-i\tilde{\beta}_*^b(

In [@CoxMau15] it was shown that under the mild geometric condition of distinct intersections with infinity that one can show the convergence of the transfinite diameter limit for algebraic varieties in an analogous way to ${\mathbb{C}}^M$. Their main results are summarised in the following two results.

\[coxmaulem\] Suppose that ${\mathcal{V}}$ is a pure $M$-dimensional affine algebraic variety with distinct intersections with infinity. For some $t\in{\mathbb{N}}$ sufficiently large there are polynomials $v_1,...v_d\in{\mathbb{C}}_{=t}[{\mathcal{V}}]$ satisfying the following properties.

-   [$v_i*v_i = x_M^{2t} + \sum_{k=1}^{M-1} x_kh_k + h_0$ with $\deg(h_k)\leq 2t-1$ for each $k=0, ..., M-1$.]{}

-   [$v_i*v_j = \sum_{k=1}^{M-1} x_kq_k + q_0$ if $i\neq j$ with $\deg(q_k)\leq 2t-1$ for each $k$.]{}

-   [${\mathbb{C}}[{\mathcal{V}}]$ is spanned by $$\begin{aligned}
    (\star)&\quad x^\beta x_M^l*y^\alpha, &&\beta\in{\mathbb{Z}}^{M-1}_{\geq0}, x^l_My^\alpha\in \mathcal{A}.\\
    (\star\star)&\quad x^\beta x_M^l*v_i,&&\beta\in{\mathbb{Z}}^{M-1}_{\geq0}, l\geq 0, i=1,...,d.\end{aligned}$$ where $\mathcal{A} = \{x_M^ly^\alpha \not\in {\langle}{\textsc{lt}}({{\bf I}}({\mathcal{V}})){\rangle}: l+|\alpha|\leq t-1\}$. ]{}

\[remark\] In Lemma \[deglem\] we will prove that consideration of the normal forms in property (iii) of the previous lemma is unnecessary. As a consequence of this we can interpret the previous lemma as giving us a decomposition of ${\mathbb{C}}[{\mathcal{V}}]$ in the following way $$\begin{

When these definitions are applied to the microcanonical ensemble asuming the generalized Boltzmann’s Principle, the Eq.(\[cr\]), the physical temperature coincides with the usual Boltzmann’s relation:

$$\frac{1}{kT_{phys}}=\frac{\partial }{\partial E}S_{B}\text{.}$$

It is easy to show, that this result does not depend on the entropy counting rule of the generalized Boltzmann’s Principle [@vel1], but on separability of a closed system in subsystems weakly correlated among them, and the additivity of the integrals of motion and the macroscopic parameters. It must be recalled that these exigencies are only valid for the extensive systems, but, it is not the case that we are studying here. Our result comes in fashion as consequence of the system scaling laws in the thermodynamic limit.

An important second condition must be satisfied for the validity of the Legendre’s transformation, [*the stability of the maximum*]{}. This condition leads to the q-generalization of the [*Microcanonical Thermostatistics*]{} of D. H. E. Gross [@gro1]. In this approach, the stability of the Legendre’s formalism is supported by the concavity of the entropy, the negative definition of the quadratic forms of the curvature tensor [@gro1; @vel2]. In the Tsallis’ case, the curvature tensor must be modified as:

$$\left( K_{q}\right) _{\mu \nu }=\frac{1}{1-\left( 1-q\right) \widetilde{P}%
_{q}}\left[ \left( 2-q\right) \frac{\partial }{\partial I^{\mu }}\frac{%
\partial }{\partial I^{\nu }}\left( S_{B}\right) _{q}+\right.$$

$$\left. +\left( 1-q\right) \left( \beta _{\mu }\frac{\partial }{\partial
I^{\nu }}\left( S_{B}\right) _{q}+\beta _{\nu }\frac{\partial }{\partial
I^{\mu }}\left( S_{B}\right) _{q}\right) \right] \text{.}$$

Taking into consideration that the scaling behavior of the functions $\left(
S_{B}\right) _{q}$ and $\widetilde{P}_{q}$ are identical, which is derived from the Eq.(\[ltp\]), it is easy to see that the curvature tensor is scaling invariant

We have run a suite of simulations with different prescriptions for the gas thermodynamics, and show here the results of two runs in which radiative cooling and heating processes are not included directly, rather an adiabatic equation of state with either $\gamma=7/5$ or $\gamma=5/3$ is adopted (irreversible shock heating, which is important during the merging phase, is included via an artificial viscosity term in the energy equation). According to the radiative transfer calculations of \[10\] the case $\gamma=7/5$ approximates quite well the balance between radiative heating and cooling in a starburst galaxy (in \[7\] a central starburst indeed does occur in the final phase of the merger that we are considering here). A stiffer equation of state such as that with $\gamma=5/3$ might instead be relevant when an additional strong heating source, for example AGN feedback, comes into play (\[11\]). Although one should follow directly the various cooling and heating mechanisms, this simple scheme can provide us with a guide of how gas thermodynamics can affect the results.

Results {#sec:3}
=======

Our simulations allow to assess in a self-consistent way the evolution of the nuclear region of a gas-rich remnant of a major merger as well as the orbital evolution of SMBHs in the nuclei of the two merging galaxies.

Gas Inflows and the Structure of the Nuclear Disks
--------------------------------------------------

About 80% of the gas originally belonging to the two galaxies is funneled to the central kiloparsec during the last stage of the merger and settles into two rotationally supported disks. When the cores of the two galaxies finally merge, the two disks also merge into a single gaseous core which rapidly becomes rotationally supported as radial motions are largely dissipated in shocks. The disk however remains non-axisymmetric, with evident bar-like and spiral patterns (

The competition between magnetocrystalline, exchange and magnetostatic interactions results in a pattern of regularly spaced stripe domains perpendicular to the wire axis. Varying the wire linewidth changes the ratio of these energies and hence the domain size. Fig. \[fig1\] shows magnetic force microscopy (MFM) measurements of a 2 $\mu$m wire in zero field performed at room temperature with a vertically magnetized tip. These images highlight the DWs and magnetic poles at the wire edges. For instance, clearly visible in Fig. \[fig1\]b are light and dark contrast along the DWs indicative of Bloch-like walls with sections of different chirality. The magnetic domain configurations are strongly affected by the magnetic history of the samples. Before imaging the wires were magnetized to saturation with a magnetic field transverse (Fig. \[fig1\]a) or longitudinal (Fig. \[fig1\]b) to the wire axis. In the transverse case the mean stripe domain length is 1.6 $\mu$m and much larger than in the longitudinal case, where it is 0.4 $\mu$m. The observed domain structure at $H=0$ is stable over observation times of at least several hours showing that the DWs are strongly pinned at room temperature.

In Fig. \[fig2\] the average domain wall separation is plotted as a function of wire linewidth and magnetic history. The DW density varies by an order of magnitude for the linewidths investigated. Differences between domain configurations after transverse and longitudinal saturation are observed for wires with linewidths between 1 and 10 $\mu$m. Dotted lines in Fig. \[fig1\]a illustrate the approximate domain structure. Since current is directed along the wire, there are domains with magnetization [**M**]{} oriented both parallel and perpendicular to the current density [**J**]{}. In order to estimate the MR contributions due to resistivity anisotropy the volume fraction of closure domains (with [**M**]{} $\parallel$ [**J**]{}) has been estimated. Fig. \[fig2\] also shows this fraction (labeled $\gamma$) determined from MFM images after magnetic saturation in either the transverse or longitudinal direction.

MR measurements were performed in a variable temperature high field cryostat with in-situ (low temperature) sample rotation capabilities. The applied field was in the plane of the film and oriented either longitudinal ($\parallel$) or transverse ($\perp$) to the wire axis. A 4 probe ac ($\sim$10 Hz) resistance bridge with low bias

It is more important and more difficult to consider the flow of the $\beta$-function itself. Namely, given a character $\varphi$, we can set $L_0 =
\log(\varphi)$ and study the $\beta$-functions of the characters $\varphi(s)
= \exp(L(s)).$ In Theorem \[t:flow\], we give a differential equation for $\beta_{\varphi(s)}.$

To define the beta character, we recall material from [@ck2; @ef-manchon; @man]. Throughout this section, $\mathcal A$ denotes the algebra of Laurent series.

Let $\mathcal H=\bigoplus\limits_{n}\mathcal H_n$ be a connected graded Hopf algebra. Let $Y$ be the biderivation on $\mathcal H$ given on homogeneous elements by $$Y:\mathcal H_n\to \mathcal H_n,\ \ \ \ \ Y(x)=nx\ \ \ \text{for }
x \in\mathcal H_n.$$

\[def:6.1\] [@man] We define the bijection $\tilde R:G_{\mathcal A}\to\mathfrak g_{\mathcal A}$ by $$\tilde R(\varphi)=\varphi^{-1}\star(\varphi\circ Y).$$

Consider the semidirect product Lie algebra $\tilde{\mathfrak g}_{\mathcal A}
 =\mathfrak g_{\mathcal A}\rtimes{\mathbb C}\cdot Z_0,$ where $Z_0$ acts via $[Z_0,X]=X\circ Y$ for $X\in\mathfrak g_{\mathcal A}$. Let $\{\theta_t\}_{t\in\mathbb C}$ be the one-parameter group of automorphisms of $\mathcal
 H$ given by $$\theta_t(x)=e^{nt}x, \text{   for }x\in\mathcal H_n.$$ Then $\varphi\ \ 
\mapsto
\varphi\circ\theta_t$ is an automorphism of $G_{\mathcal A}$. Let $\tilde{G}_{\mathcal A}$ be the semidirect product $$\tilde{G}_{\mathcal A}=G_{\mathcal A}\rtimes\mathbb C ,$$ with the action of $\mathbb C $ on $G_{\mathcal A}$ given by $\varphi\cdot t=\varphi\circ\theta_t$. $G_{\mathcal A}$ has Lie algebra $\mathfrak g_{\mathcal A}$.

We now define a second action of

In the strong coupling regime $b\rightarrow\infty$ the action is useless. However, one can use the following observation. Each pair of fermionic screening charges defines the conformal algebra of the coset CFT $SU(2)_{\kappa}/U(1)$ with $\kappa=-2-b^{2}$. It is well known that this algebra commutes with a third screening charge $$\mathcal{W}=\oint\left(b\partial\Phi_{k}-i\beta\partial\phi_{k}\right)e^{b^{-1}(\Phi_{k}-\Phi_{k+1})}d\xi,$$ known also as Wakimoto screening charge. It means that the theory $$\label{action-dual}
   \tilde{\mathcal{A}}_{n}=\int\left(\frac{1}{8\pi}\left(\partial_{a}\Phi\cdot\partial_{a}\Phi\right)+\frac{1}{8\pi}\left(\partial_{a}\phi\cdot\partial_{a}\phi\right)+
   \tilde{\Lambda}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\left(b\partial\Phi_{k}-i\beta\partial\phi_{k}\right)\left(b\bar{\partial}\Phi_{k}-i\beta\bar{\partial}\phi_{k}\right)e^{b^{-1}(\Phi_{k}-\Phi_{k+1})}\right)\,d^{2}\xi,$$ shares the same integrable structure in the limit $\tilde{\Lambda}\rightarrow0$ as the original one in the limit $\Lambda\rightarrow0$. Actually, the theory makes sense only in the region $b\rightarrow\infty$. In order to regularize its UV behavior one has to add counterterms. Total renormalized action will have a form of a sigma-model $$\label{action-SM}
  \tilde{\mathcal{A}}_{n}=\frac{1}{8\pi}\int G_{\mu\nu}(\boldsymbol{X}|\tilde{\Lambda},b^{2})\partial_{a}X^{\mu}\partial_{a}X^{\nu}d^{2}\xi,\quad\text{where}\quad
  \boldsymbol{X}=(\Phi_{1},\dots,\Phi_{n},\phi_{1},\dots,\phi_{n}).$$ The precise form of the metric $G_{\mu\nu}(\boldsymbol{X}|\tilde{\Lambda},b^{2})$ might be very complicated. Moreover, it depends

2.  $\mathcal{F}$ is of the form $\operatorname{forbid}(A)$ for some finite antichain $A$ with respect to the minor relation $\leq$.

The Galois closed sets of relational constraints were likewise described by Pippenger [@Pippenger]; this description was extended to arbitrary, possibly infinite, underlying sets in [@CF]. We shall briefly survey Pippenger’s description of the Galois closed sets of constraints.

An $m$-ary relational constraint $(R,S)$ is a *simple minor* of an $(m+p)$-ary relational constraint $(R',S')$ if there is $h \colon \{1, \ldots, n\} \to \{1, \ldots, m+p\}$ such that $$\begin{aligned}
  R
   \left(\begin{array}{c}
   x_1\\
   \vdots \\
   x_m\\
   \end{array}\right)
  &
\quad  \iff  \quad 
\exists x_{m+1} \ldots \exists x_{m+p} \quad 
R'
   \left(\begin{array}{c}
   x_{h(1)}\\
   \vdots \\
   x_{h(n)}\\
   \end{array}\right)
\intertext{and}
  S
   \left(\begin{array}{c}
   x_1\\
   \vdots \\
   x_m\\
   \end{array}\right)
  &
\quad \iff \quad 
\exists x_{m+1} \ldots \exists x_{m+p} \quad 
S'
   \left(\begin{array}{c}
   x_{h(1)}\\
   \vdots \\
   x_{h(n)}\\
   \end{array}\right).
 \end{aligned}$$

Note that simple minors subsume the notions of permutation, diagonalization and projection of arguments; for background see [@CF; @Pippenger].

A constraint $(R,S)$ is obtained from a constraint $(R',S)$ by *restricting the antecedent* if $R\subseteq R'$. Likewise, $(R,S)$ is obtained from a constraint $(R,S')$ by *extending the consequent* if $S\supseteq S

So a minimal resolution of $M$ looks in general as follows

$... \to G \to F \to G \to F_{n-1} \to ... \to F_0 \to M \to 0$.

As a consequence all the homological invariants like $Tor_k^R(M,N), Ext_R^k(M,n)$ are 2-priodic, [@BVS], [@EP].

The category of matrix factorizations of $f$ over $R$, namely $MF(R,f)$; is defined to be the differential $\mathbb{Z}/2$-graded category, whose objects are pairs $(X,d)$, where $X=X^0 \oplus X^1$ is a free $\mathbb{Z}/2$-graded $R$-module of finite rank equipped with an $R$-linear map $d$ of odd degree satisfying $d^2=f.\ id_X$. Here the degree is calculated in $\mathbb{Z}/2$. Regarding to the first definition

$$d= \left( 
\begin{array}{cc}
0  &  d_0\\
d_1 &   0
\end{array} \right), \qquad d^2=f.\ id.$$

The morphisms $MF(X,X')$ are given by $\mathbb{Z}/2$-graded $R$-module maps from $X$ to $X'$ (or equivalent between the components $X^0$ and $X^1$) provided that the differential is given by

$$d(f)=d_{X'} \circ f - (-1)^{\mid f \mid} f \circ d_X.$$

Here $d_{X}$ or $d_X^{\prime}$ may be considered as the matrix given above or to be separately $d_0$ and $d_1$, and also it is evident that $d(f)^2=0$. By choosing bases for $X^0$ and $X^1$ we reach to the former definition, [@EP].

Hochster Theta Function

                      \left({m_{out}}-{m_{12}}+\frac{GM_2^2-e_2^2-2e_2(e_{in}+e_1)}{2c^2r_*}\right)+\\\\

\\\\
  & \sqrt{\left({m_{out}}-{m_{12}}+\frac{GM_2^2-e_2^2-2e_2(e_{in}+e_1)}{2c^2r_*}\right)^2-M_2^2{f_{12}}} \Bigl\};

 \end{array}$$ here and in the following we omit the coordinate dependence of $f_a$, $M_a$ etc., implicitly assuming that they have to be evaluated on $(t_*,r_*)$ where not differently indicated.

Determination of Q$'$. {#sec:DeterminationOfQ .unnumbered}
----------------------

It is possible to apply the same procedure to the region $BOD$ (i.e. after the intersection time), finding the quantity $$\label{56}
Q'\equiv \{g_{00}^{(BOD)}u^0_{OB}u^0_{OD}+g_{11}^{(BOD)}u^1_{OB}u^1_{OD}\}_{t=t^*,r=r_1=r_2=r_*}\ .$$

Now the unit tangent vectors to trajectories $OB$ and $OD$ are[^1]:

$$\begin{aligned}
    u^i_{OB}&=(u^0_{OB},u^1_{OB},u^2_{OB},u^3_{OB}) \nonumber\\
          &=\left({\frac{d\,t}{d\tau_1}},{\frac{d\,r_1}{cd\tau_1}},0,0\right)_{t\geq t_*}, \label

\[lem:g1\] Let $\xi_2=\pi^2/4$. For $\xi \in (0,\xi_2)$ one has $$\xi^{1/4}(\sin\sqrt{\xi})^{1/2}G_1\left( \sin^2{\frac{\sqrt{\xi}}{2}}\right)=Z_J(\xi),$$ where $Z_J(\xi)$ is given by .

This concludes the summary of results of [@BF Section 5.2]. Our final goal is to compute $C_Y=C_Y(u)$ and $C_J=C_J(u)$ such that $$\label{eq:cycj2}
\xi^{1/4}(\sin{\sqrt{\xi}})^{1/2}G_2(\sin^2{\sqrt{\xi}/2})=C_YZ_Y(\xi)+C_JZ_J(\xi).$$

Note that there exist $c_1,c_2$ such that $$\begin{gathered}
\label{eq:zyxi}
Z_Y(\xi)=\left(c_1G_1\left( \sin^2{\frac{\sqrt{\xi}}{2}}\right)+c_2G_2\left( \sin^2{\frac{\sqrt{\xi}}{2}}\right) \right)\times \\ \xi^{1/4}(\sin\sqrt{\xi})^{1/2} =
c_1Z_J(\xi)+\xi^{1/4}(\sin\sqrt{\xi})^{1/2}c_2G_2\left( \sin^2{\frac{\sqrt{\xi}}{2}}\right).\end{gathered}$$ The last two equalities imply $$\label{eq:CYCJ}
C_Y=\frac{1}{c_2},\quad C_J=-\frac{c_1}{c_2}.$$

\[lem:c1c2\] One has $$\begin{gathered}
2c_1=(-1)^{k+1}\sqrt{2\pi}\frac{\Gamma(k+1/4)}{\Gamma(k-1/4)}\frac{Z_Y(\xi_2)}{\xi_{2}^{1/4}}+(-1)^k\sqrt{2\pi}\times \\\frac{\Gamma(k-1/4)}{\Gamma(k+1/4)} \xi_{2

In order to illustrate this, let us permute $\psi \leftrightarrow z$ in the solution given (\[metric for sigma constant without exponential expansion\]) and (\[F generalized\]). Also, to avoid misunderstanding we change $F(t, \psi) \rightarrow H(t, z)$. Using this notation, we find that the metric

$$\label{vaccum solutions on the brane}
dS^2 = \frac{ H^{q c/(a + b)} \dot{H}^2}{H_{z}^2} dt^2 - A H^{p_{1}}dx^2 - B H^{p_{2}}dy^2 -  H^{q c/(a + b)} dz^2 \pm C H^{p_{3}}d\psi^2,$$

where $H_{z} \equiv \partial H/\partial z$ and $H = \left[l(t) + z h(t)\right]^{(a + b)/(a + b - q c)}$, is also a solution of the field equations $R_{AB} = 0$. Although (\[metric for sigma constant without exponential expansion\]) and (\[vaccum solutions on the brane\]) are diffeomorphic in $5D$, their interpretation in $4D$ is quite different. Specifically, unlike (\[metric for sigma constant without exponential expansion\]) in (\[vaccum solutions on the brane\]): (i) the extra dimension can be either spacelike or timelike, (ii) the spacetime slices $\Sigma_{\psi}$ are non-flat, and (iii) the metric of the spacetime is independent of $\psi$. As a consequence of the latter, the extrinsic curvature $K_{\mu \nu}$, defined by (\[extrinsic curvature\]), vanishes identically. Which in turn, by virtue of (\[emt on the brane in terms of K\]), implies $\tau_{\mu\nu} = 0$, i.e., the spacetime (the brane) is devoid of matter $({\cal{T}}_{\mu\nu} = 0)$ and $\Lambda_{(4)} = 0$.

Clearly, other $5D$ metrics with properties similar to (\[vaccum solutions on the brane\]) can be constructed from the solutions (\[the metric in Gaussian coordinates\])-(\[F in the synchronous coordinates\]) of section $2$ as well as from (\[F for perfect fluid\]) and (\[F, barotropic case\]) of section $3$. The conclusion here is that the spacetime part of the $5D$ Kasner

It is also possible to extend the scheme by coupling to a different hamiltonian, such that the potential energy is given by $U=U_\text{real} + \lambda U_\text{extra}$, and then integrating along $\lambda$; we find that [@Vega2008] $$A(\lambda=1) = A(\lambda=0) + \int_{0}^1 \avg{U_\text{extra}}\,{\ensuremath{\mathrm{d}}}\lambda.$$ This is known as hamiltonian thermodynamic integration [@Vega2008] and is one component of the Einstein crystal Frenkel–Ladd approach [@Frenkel1984].

The free energy of a fluid phase evaluated from the ideal gas by decreasing the pressure at constant temperature is given by [@Vega2008] $$\frac{A}{Nk_\text{B}T}=\ln(\rho \Lambda^3) - 1  + \int_0^\rho \left[ \frac{p}{k_\text{B} T\rho^2} - \frac{1}{\rho} \right] \,{\ensuremath{\mathrm{d}}}\rho,$$ where $\Lambda$ is the de Broglie thermal wavelength. It is usually beneficial to fit the entire integrand to a single polynomial to avoid diverging terms. As the density tends to zero, the integrand tends to the second virial coefficient [@Vega2008]; it is helpful to evaluate this explicitly to benchmark the simulation results.

Gibbs–Duhem integration
-----------------------

In Gibbs–Duhem integration [@Kofke1993; @*Kofke1993b; @Vega2008], we numerically integrate the Clapeyron equation, $${\ensuremath{\frac{\mathrm{d}p}{\mathrm{d}T}}} = \frac{\upDelta H}{T\upDelta V},$$ or an analogous expression, in order to obtain new coexistence points from already known coexistence points. In our simulations, we used the fourth-order Runge–Kutta algorithm to perform this integration.

Frenkel–Ladd Einstein crystal approach
--------------------------------------

The Einstein crystal approach [@Frenkel1984; @Vega2008] is a fairly involved way of calculating the free energy of a crystal from the Einstein crystal, for which the free energy is known. We direct the interested reader to Frenkel and Smit’s book (Ref. [@Frenkel2002]) and the review paper by Vega and co-

\[lem:fullorbit\] Let $m\geq m_\ell$ and $P\in A[\ell^{m}]$ be of exact order $\ell^{m}$. Then $\nicefrac{A[\ell^m]}{\mathbb{Z}[G_{\operatorname{tors}}]\cdot P}$ is cyclic of order dividing $\ell^{m_\ell-1}$. In particular, $A[\ell]$ is a simple $\mathbb{Z}[G_{\operatorname{tors}}]$-module for all but finitely many prime numbers $\ell$.

Let $P$ be of order $\ell^m$ and let $P' \in A[\ell^m]$ be such that $\{P,P'\}$ is a $\nicefrac{\mathbb{Z}}{\ell^m \mathbb{Z}}$-basis of $A[\ell^m]$. We represent the elements of $GL_2(\nicefrac{\mathbb{Z}}{\ell^m \mathbb{Z}})$ in this basis and regard $\operatorname{Gal}(K(A[\ell^m])/K)$ as a subset of $GL_2(\nicefrac{\mathbb{Z}}{\ell^m \mathbb{Z}})$.

Let $N\leq M!$ be the index of the normal core of $\operatorname{Gal}(K(A[\ell^m])/K)$ in $GL_2(\nicefrac{\mathbb{Z}}{\ell^m \mathbb{Z}})$. Then $$\sigma=\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\ 1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}^N = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\ N & 1
\end{pmatrix} \in \operatorname{Gal}(K(A[\ell^m])/K).$$ Now $\sigma(P)-P=N\cdot P' \in \mathbb{Z}[G_{\operatorname{tors}}]\cdot P$. Let $\ell^n$ be the largest $\ell$-power dividing $N$, then $\nicefrac{N}{\ell^n}\in\left(\nicefrac{\mathbb{Z}}{\ell^m\mathbb{Z}}\right)^*$ and hence $\ell^n \cdot P' \in \mathbb{Z}[G_{\operatorname{tors}}]\cdot P$. Therefore, $\nicefrac{A[\ell^m]}{\mathbb{Z}[G_{\operatorname{tors}}]\cdot P}$ is a cyclic group of order dividing $\ell^n \leq \

**Fitness in liquid culture.** The growth rates in liquid culture were determined by taking standard growth curves of cells pre-grown in exponential phase in CSM for more than 12 hours, using a Coulter counter. The relative fitness in direct competition in liquid culture was determined with a flow-cytometer-based competition assay as described in Ref. [@LangMurray09].

  : Expression of a fluorescent protein in our reference strains does not incur a fitness cost: There is no significant selective advantage in competitions of the yellow wild-type yJHK111 with the non-fluorescent wild-type yJHK102, or with the red wild-type yJHK112. Errors are standard deviations, and the number $N$ of replicates is given in parentheses.[]{data-label="tab:neutral"}

Our fitness assay does not rely on any assumptions about the exact origin of the fitness difference between the strains. The assay, however, would be more valuable if we can show that the introduction of fluorescence does not significantly affect the fitness. We therefore measured the relative fitnesses of our three reference strains, that differ only in the expression of a fluorescent protein: the non-fluorescent strain yJHK102, the yellow strain yJHK111 (constitutively expresses mCitrine), and the red strain yJHK112 (constitutively expresses mCherry). We confirmed that these strains are neutral with respect to each other, as measured using the liquid culture fitness assay and the radial plate sector assay, see table \[tab:neutral\]. This means that the expression of our fluorescent proteins does not incur a fitness cost.

Examples of radial expansions of mixes of these strains are shown in figure \[fig:neutral

Most of the measurements reported here were performed by the FM NMOR technique [@Bud2002FM]. Recent reviews of nonlinear magneto-optics of resonant vapors are given in Refs. [@Bud2002RMP; @Ale2005]. The vapor cell at room temperature was mounted within a cylindrical double-layered magnetic shield. We used a distributed-feedback (DFB) laser producing up to 10$\ $mW of cw light, tuned to the Cs D1 line (with wavelength in vacuum of $\lambda=894.6\ $nm). The laser beam was attenuated, passed through a Glan polarizer, and directed through holes in the magnetic shield through the vapor cell. The light beam was apertured to about 2$\
$mm in diameter before entering the cell. The curvature of the cell caused the transmitted light beam to diverge. This divergence was compensated by installing a 2.5$\ $cm-diameter anti-reflection coated lens with a focal length of 2.5$\ $cm at a distance of 0.15$\
$cm after the cell. The light after the lens exited the magnetic shield and was analyzed with a Wollaston polarizer and a balanced photoreceiver whose output was connected to a digital-signal-processing lock-in amplifier. The laser frequency was sinusoidally modulated by dithering the junction current, and the synchronous signal due to optical rotation was detected.

From auxiliary absorption measurements, we estimated the Cs-vapor density in the cell to be approximately $3\cdot 10^9\ $cm$^{-3}$. This density is an order of magnitude lower than the saturated density of Cs at room temperature, in our experience, a not-too-uncommon occurrence in paraffin-coated cells (the density can usually be brought closer to the saturated density by reheating the stem; however, this was not needed here, as the signals were sufficiently strong even with this low alkali-vapor density). A solenoid was installed within the innermost magnetic shield and was used to set or scan the magnetic field applied to the cell directed collinearly with the light-propagation direction (the Faraday-rotation geometry). In a typical measurement, we would tune the central frequency of the laser to a particular value near the resonance, set the modulation frequency and amplitude, and record the output of the lock-in amplifier as a function of the magnetic field.

An example of such an FM NMOR scan is shown in Fig.\[Fig\_LowPowerFMS

We simply notice that the classical Hill’s estimator is $H_n(I_d,1)$ where $I_d$ is the identity function on $\mathbb{N}\setminus \{0\}$. Let us give asymptotic normality for Double-indexed function Hill estimator.\
**(a) Extreme Limit Theorem**.\
We begin with the simple Hill’s estimator.\

\[theoHill\] For $]0, \ n] \ni k(n)\rightarrow +\infty$ such that

$$k(n)^{3/4}/\log n \rightarrow 0. \tag{K1}$$

we have, as $n\rightarrow +\infty$,

$$\sqrt{k(n)} \left(H_n-\gamma\right) \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{N}(0,\gamma^2). \label{hillSN}$$

We want to establish the random rate of convergence associated with the convergence \[hillSN\] in the part (a) of the following corollary. In the part (b), we want to share that we need any other condition on top of $k(n)/n \rightarrow 0$ to have the central limit theorem if $F^{-1}$ is reduced to

$$F_{\ast}^{-1}(1-u)=\gamma \log u - C(\gamma) \log \log(1/u), \ u \in ]0,1[, \ C(\gamma)\geq 1. \label{Freduced}$$

\[theoHillCoro\] We have the following results.\
(a) Here again $F$ is the *cdf* of the Pseudo-Lindley distribution with parameters $\theta>0$ and $\beta>0$ and the notation above. Let $k(n)/\log n\rightarrow 0$.

Let $W(1)$ is a standard Gaussian random variable. Then we have

$$\frac{\log n}{\gamma \sqrt{k(n)}} \biggr(\sqrt{k(n)}(H_n-\gamma)-\gamma W(1)\biggr) \rightarrow_{\mathbb{P}} 1,$$

\(b) If $F^{-1}$ were reduced as in Formula , we have the asymptotic normality


2.  $\operatorname{Ker}{G_{}{^{\scriptscriptstyleL,{\mathcal{V}_{}}}}}=\{0\}$,

3.  ${\@ifstar{\@proldf}{\@prolpf}}[E]{{\mathcal{M}}} \cap F=\{0\}$,

It is clear that the matrix $({\mathcal C}^{AB})$ in  is regular if and only if ${\@ifstar{\@proldf}{\@prolpf}}[E]{{\mathcal{M}}}\cap
  F=\{0\}$. Thus, the properties (1) and (3) are equivalent. Moreover, proceeding as in the proof of Theorem \[regularity\], we deduce that the properties (2) and (3) (respectively, (2) and (4)) also are equivalent.

\[mechty\] [If $L$ is a Lagrangian function of mechanical type, then, using Theorem \[regular-nonl\], we deduce (as in the case of linear constraints) that the constrained system $(L, {\mathcal{M}})$ is always regular.]{}

Lagrange-d’Alembert solutions and nonholonomic bracket

Assume that the constrained Lagrangian system $(L, {\mathcal{M}})$ is regular. Then (3) in Theorem \[regular-nonl\] is equivalent to $({\@ifstar{\@proldf}{\@prolpf}}[E]{E})|_{\mathcal{M}}\ = {\@ifstar{\@proldf}{\@prolpf}}[E]{{\mathcal{M}}} \oplus F$. Denote by $P$ and $Q$ the complementary projectors defined by this decomposition $$P_{a}: {\@ifstar{\@proldf}{\@prolpf}}[E]{E}[a] \to {\@ifstar{\@proldf}{\@prolpf}}[E]{{\mathcal{M}}}[a], \makebox[.3cm]{} Q_{a}:

Hence, we shall prove two different statements. One is that the main body of [$\kappa$-]{}indeed reduces ${\mathcal{R}}$ to the sequence ${\mathcal{S}}$ with an optimal merge cost, up to some error that we shall evaluate. The other one is that the sequence ${\mathcal{S}}$, although it might not be a border of any merge tree induced by ${\mathcal{R}}$ for an optimal stable merge policy, is still good enough that the cost penalty incurred by using ${\mathcal{S}}$ as an intermediate state is not too high.

For the sake of readability, and given a sequence of runs ${\mathcal{R}}= (R_1,\ldots,R_\rho)$, we identify below every sub-interval $X$ of $\{1,\ldots,\rho\}$ with the run obtained by merging those runs $R_k$ such that $k \in X$. Accordingly, we have $R_{\{k\}} = R_k$, and we also set $r_X = \sum_{k \in X} r_k$, and so on. Furthermore, if $X = \{x_1,\ldots,x_k\}$, we denote by ${\mathsf{mc}}_X$ the minimal merge cost of a stable merge policy that would sort the sequence $(R_{x_1},\ldots,R_{x_k})$ and merge these runs into the run $R_X$.

\[def:diff:partition\] Let $\mathbf{I} = (I_1,\ldots,I_n)$ and $\mathbf{J} = (J_1,\ldots,J_m)$ be two partitions of the set $\{1,\ldots,\rho\}$ into intervals, and such that $\mathbf{J}$ refines $\mathbf{I}$, i.e., that every interval $J_j$ is contained in some interval $I_i$.

For all $i \leqslant n$, we set $\mathsf{d}_i = \#\{j \colon J_j \subseteq I_i\}$, i.e., $\mathsf{d}_i$ is the number of intervals $I_i$ in which $J_j$ is subdivided. We say that $\mathbf{J}$ is a *$\mathsf{d}$-refinement* of $\mathbf{I}$ if $\mathsf{d}_i \leqslant \mathsf{d}$ for all $i \leqslant n$.

Finally, we call *distortion* between $\

Let $\{E_i\}$ be a MIC on $d$-dimensional Hilbert space, and assume that this MIC is equal-weight, that is, $E_i = (1/d) \rho_i$ for some rank-1 projection operators $\{\rho_i\}$. Consider the quantity $$F := \sum_{ij} \left(\delta_{ij} - \tr E_i E_j\right)^2,$$ which is the squared Frobenius distance between the MIC’s Gram matrix and the identity. If the MIC could be an orthonormal basis of the operator space, then the distance $F$ would vanish. We can split $F$ into two sums, as follows: $$F = \sum_i \left(1 - \tr E_i^2\right)^2
 + \sum_{i \neq j} \left(\tr E_i E_j\right)^2.$$ The equal-weight and rank-1 conditions let us simplify the first sum, yielding $$F = d^2 \left(1 - \frac{1}{d^2}\right)^2
 + \sum_{i \neq j} \left(\tr E_i E_j\right)^2.$$ Applying the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality to the remaining sum, we get that $$F \geq d^2 \left(1 - \frac{1}{d^2}\right)^2
 + \frac{1}{d^4 - d^2}
   \left(\sum_{i \neq j} \tr E_i E_j\right)^2,$$ with equality iff all the terms in the sum are equal, i.e., $\tr E_i
E_j$ is constant for all $i \neq j$. Because the $\{E_i\}$ must sum to the identity, $$\sum_{i \neq j} \tr E_i E_j
 = \sum_i \tr E_i (I - E_i)
 = d - 1.$$ Consequently, $$F \geq \left(d-\frac{1}{d}\right)^2
 + \frac{d-1}{d^4 - d^2},$$ with equality iff the MIC is symmetric, i.e., $\tr E_i E_j$ is constant for all $i \neq j$. The value of this constant is fixed by dividing its sum evenly across all contributions: $$\tr E

To select weak CSS sources from the FIRST catalogue we made the following steps:

1.  From the source list based on Green Bank (GB) surveys at 21 and 6 cm @wb92 we selected those sources lying within the then current limits of the FIRST survey when FIRST covered the area of declination $28\degr$ — $42\degr$, having steep spectra ($\alpha >0.5$) and being stronger than 150 mJy at 6 cm. (This flux density limit was chosen in order to produce a sample of manageable size.) The above declination limits indicate that the overlap between our sample and the B3-VLA survey based sample of F2001 (their limits are $37\degr 15\arcmin$ — $47\degr 37\arcmin$) is not large.

2.  We identified FIRST sources with those GB survey sources. We found, quite expectedly, that thanks to a dramatic difference in the resolution, the majority of sources appearing as single in the GB survey turn out to be double (or multiple) on FIRST maps and so they are represented either as compact pairs or clusters of pointlike sources in the FIRST catalogue.

3.  We rejected all such cases i.e. we selected only those sources that are single entities in the FIRST catalogue i.e. more compact than the FIRST beam (54) and surrounded by an empty field. We adopted 1 arcmin as a radius of that field. Such a procedure allows us to make sure that we deal with isolated objects and not parts of larger objects.

4.  We, again, checked whether our targets fulfill the spectrum steepness criterion: instead of GB-survey flux densities at 21 cm we used more accurate values from FIRST. We rejected candidates with flat spectra ($\alpha \leq 0.5$).

5.  We found that all already known CSS sources lying within our R.A. and declination limits have been correctly selected so far. Obviously we rejected them.

6.  We rejected the Gigahertz Peaked Spectrum (GPS) sources because — in our opinion — they constitute a separate class. The main reason for this is that GPSs are an order of magnitude more compact than CSSs and their spectra have a different shape. Our research was focused on “true” CSSs and not GPSs[^2] To this end we identified our preliminary candidates with objects listed in 365 MHz Texas catalogue [@doug

Josephson junctions are building elements of many electronic and electromagnetic devices as well as a candidate for quantum computers[@BaroneBook]. In practical applications, one usually integrates large arrays of junctions on a chip to enhance the performance, thus coherent operations in these junctions are crucial. The synchronization between junctions can be realized by coupling them to a common resonator, most frequently through electromagnetic coupling. The common resonator establishes long-range interaction between junctions, which then synchronizes them under appropriate condition. The junctions arrays have become an extremely important playground to understand the synchronization mechanism for large population of nonlinear oscillators, partially because of the relatively easy experimental realization.[@Hadley88; @Jain84; @Wiesenfeld96; @Durala99; @Filatrella00; @Grib02; @Grib06; @Filatrella07; @Madsen08].

The successful observations of coherent emission from cuprate superconductors renew the interests in understanding the synchronization of arrays of Josephson junctions [@Bae07; @Ozyuzer07; @kadowaki08; @Wang09; @Wang10; @Tsujimoto10; @Krasnov10]. Cuprate superconductors, such as $\rm{Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+\delta}}$ (BSCCO), are a natural realization of a stack of Josephson junctions of atomic thickness [@Kleiner92; @Kleiner94], known as intrinsic Josephson junctions (IJJs). Because of the large supercoducting energy gap, these build-in Josephson junctions can be operated at frequencies in the terahertz region, where the electromagnetic waves have wide applications [@Ferguson02; @Tonouchi07].

Radiation from IJJs occurs in the resistive state. Such a state is reached by increasing the bias current above the Josephson critical current and then diminishing it down to the voltage $V$ corresponding to the target frequency according to the Josephson relation $\omega=2eV/\hbar $. The resistive state is preserved down to the retrapping current below which the system undergoes transition into the zero-voltage state. Such a procedure is possible because the resistivity of IJJs is very large, i.e. junctions are strongly underdamped. Thus the hysteretic behavior allows us, in principle, to reach a quite low voltage of the order of that corresponding to the Josephson frequency ($\sim 0.1\rm{THz}$ for BSCCO

Since we have a finite number of particles, the jet volume is only partially patched by the volume occupied by such Lagrangian particles, [i.e., the volume filling factor is smaller than one]{}. [ Increasing]{} the number of particles [brings it closer]{} to one. To test the volume filling method, we produce an “image” of the jet at an observer time $t_{\rm obs}=0$ with a $90^\circ$ viewing angle, accumulating in each pixel the contributions corresponding to a laboratory frame time interval $\Delta T=2 R_{\rm b}/c$. However, instead of summing up the emissivity, we add up the length of the intersection of each particle’s volume with each pixel in the $(x_{\rm
  obs}, y_{\rm obs})$ plane (as described above). The idea behind the substitution of the emissivity by the intersection length is that, at $90^\circ$ the intersection length and the intersection volume of the particles are proportional and, thus, measuring lengths or volumes is equivalent.

Since we accumulate in every pixel all contributions in the range $[-\Delta T/2, \Delta T/2]$, the intersection length with each particle equals the size of the particle perpendicular to the LoS ($2\Delta r$). [Hence,]{} the value accumulated in a pixel ${\cal
  P}:=(x_{\rm obs}, y_{\rm obs})$, namely $L_{\rm px}$, [is]{} $$L_{\rm px} = \sum_i \frac{A_i}{A_{\rm px}} 2\Delta r\, ,
\label{eq:Lpx}$$ where $A_i$ and $A_{\rm px}$ are the area of intersection of a particle with a pixel and the pixel area, respectively. The sum in Eq. (\[eq:Lpx\]) extends over all particles that are intersected by the line of sight that departs from ${\cal P}$. In the limit $\Delta r
\rightarrow 0$ (equivalently, $N_{\rm p} \rightarrow \infty$) $A_i
\rightarrow 4(\Delta r)^2$. On the other hand, the number of particles intersected by the LoS departing from ${\cal P}$ and having a cross sectional area $A_{\rm px}$ is $N_{\rm px}= A_{\rm px}/(2\Delta
r)^2$. Therefore, we have $$\lim

Stylized facts of evaluation distributions
------------------------------------------

Figure \[fig:04-ccdfFitsLNLD\] shows the probability density functions of the distributions of the amount of likes and dislikes for items in each of the four datasets. To understand the process that generates these distributions, we fit a set of parametric distributions that provide insights into how likes and dislikes are given to items. Following the categorization of [@Mitzenmacher2004], generative mechanisms produce stylized size distributions that can be traced back to the properties of growth processes. If the appearance of likes and dislikes follows an uncorrelated process and new evaluations are independent of previous ones, likes and dislikes should follow *exponential* distributions. On the other hand, the presence of likes and dislikes can motivate further evaluations through social effects, creating multiplicative growth (also known as preferential attachment in the context of networks). In the presence of multiplicative growth, if items have similar lifespans, likes and dislikes follow *log-normal* distributions. On the other hand if multiplicative growth is combined with heterogeneous lifespans, likes and dislikes follow a *power law* distribution. This power law can be corrected by adding an exponential cutoff if finite size effects limit the growth of likes and dislikes, a case in which the distributions would be better fitted by a *truncated power law*.

We will prove that a finite group all of whose sections $S$ satisfy $\varphi(S)\neq 0$ is nilpotent. Assume that $G$ is a counterexample of minimal order. Then $G$ is a Schmidt group since all its proper subgroups satisfy the hypothesis. By [@8] (see also [@2; @7]) it follows that $G$ is a solvable group of order $p^mq^n$ (where $p$ and $q$ are different primes) with a unique Sylow $p$-subgroup $P$ and a cyclic Sylow $q$-subgroup $Q$, and hence $G$ is a semidirect product of $P$ by $Q$. Moreover, we have:

-   if $Q=\langle y\rangle$ then $y^q\in Z(G)$;

-   $Z(G)=\Phi(G)=\Phi(P)\times\langle y^q\rangle$, $G'=P$, $P'=(G')'=\Phi(P)$;

-   $|P/P'|=p^r$, where $r$ is the order of $p$ modulo $q$;

-   if $P$ is abelian, then $P$ is an elementary abelian $p$-group of order $p^r$ and $P$ is a minimal normal subgroup of $G$;

-   if $P$ is non-abelian, then $Z(P)=P'=\Phi(P)$ and $|P/Z(P)|=p^r$.

We infer that $S=G/Z(G)$ is also a Schmidt group of order $p^rq$ which can be written as semidirect product of an elementary abelian $p$-group $P_1$ of order $p^r$ by a cyclic group $Q_1$ of order $q$ (note that $S_3$ and $A_4$ are examples of such groups). Clearly, we have $$\exp(S)=pq.$$On the other hand, it is easy to see that $$L(S)=L(P_1)\cup\{Q_1^x \mid x\in S\}\cup\{S\}.$$Thus, the section $S$ does not have cyclic subgroups of order $pq$ and consequently $\varphi(S)=0$, a contradiction. This completes the proof.

In order to simplify our search algorithm (at the cost of making it overall less efficient), we shall for each rational length of $S$ look at the set of possible denominators of the angles involved in $S'$ realising said length, and at the set of denominators realising any possible rational length of $S - S'$. Then we shall obtain a list of possible denominators $\delta_a$, $\delta_b$, $\delta_c$, $\delta_d$ that $a = \frac{\nu_a}{\delta_a} \pi$, $b = \frac{\nu_b}{\delta_b} \pi$, $c = \frac{\nu_c}{\delta_c} \pi$, $d = \frac{\nu_d}{\delta_d} \pi$ may have, and choose their numerators $\nu_a$, $\nu_b$, $\nu_c$, $\nu_d$ so that $0 < a$, $b$, $c$, $d < \pi$. If any number of the form $\frac{\nu}{\delta} \pi$ equals $0$, then we assume $\delta = \infty$. Such an approach is still practically reasonable, and takes about $90$ minutes in total to run in `SageMath` [@Sage] on a MacPro 2.3 GHz Intel Core i5 Processor with 8 Mb RAM. An observation from Galois theory implies that if $S = \cos a + \cos b + \cos c + \cos d$ has rational length $1$, then the list of possible denominators of angles in $S$ is $L_0= \{ 1, 2, 3, \infty \}$.

If $S$ has rational length $2$ realised by a sub-sum $S'$, then the list of possible denominators in $S'$ is $L_1 = \{ 3, 5 \}$ as indicated by item $3$ of Theorem \[thm:cj\], while the denominators in $S - S'$ can belong either to $L_0$ or to $L_1$.

If $S$ has rational length $3$ realised by a sub-sum $S'$, then the denominators of angles in $S'$ belong either to the list $L_2 = \{ 3, 7 \}$, or to $L_3 = \{ 3, 5, 15 \}$, as indicated by items $4$, $5$ and $6

Much of the essential information content of the charge measurement is duplicated in the phonon measurement, through the production of secondary phonon populations as charges propagate through the crystal and then enter aluminum structures at the surface. These different phonon populations are produced with different initial energy distributions. In Germanium, high energy phonons exhibit high isotopic scattering rates ($\tau_{i}^{-1}~=~[36.7\times10^{-42}]\nu^4$ for Ge)[@tamura1985] meaning that they have short mean free paths and propagate diffusively ($\ell~=~[5.4~km/s]\tau_{i}~=~[1.5\times10^{44}~m/s^4]\nu^{-4}$ at long wavelengths). Only 6.1$\%$ of the top and bottom crystal surfaces is covered with phonon-absorbing aluminum (largely in the form of QETs), meaning that, per surface interaction, a phonon is far more likely to reflect off a polished Ge surface than be absorbed in a QET. A phonon’s timescale of surface absorption then is roughly proportional to its rate of surface interactions, and is therefor highly dependent on mean free path. Phonons with a mean free path on order of the detector size (ie, which propagate ballistically) are absorbed with the maximally slow decay constant of 755 $\mu$s, and higher energy phonons are absorbed with significantly faster decay constants. Phonons anharmonically decay in energy ($\tau_{a}^{-1} = [1.61\times10^{-55}]\nu^5$)[@msall1997], meaning that mean free path increases with time. This energy-dependent diffusion and decay process is typically termed “quasidiffusion”. Here we summarize the relevant characteristics of the major phonon populations in a SuperCDMS detector, emphasizing where they begin in their quasidiffusive evolution:

-   **Primary phonons** produced by the recoil event itself are initially highly energetic ($\nu > $1 THz, ie $\ell~<~\sim$ 100$\mu$m). If the event occurs far from a sensor surface, the diffusive behavior slows the arrival at the surface and lengthens the eventual mean free path, slowing the absorption rate at that surface. If the event occurs near a sensor surface, there is little delay in arrival, and the comparatively short mean free path increases a the rate of absorption at that surface.

The numbers of collected silhouette images of the crab, lion and hare were 100, 100 and 105, respectively (I bought silhouette images from Deposit Photos (https://jp.depositphotos.com/), and downloaded free images from Silhouette AC (https://www.silhouette-ac.com/index.html), Illust AC (https://www.ac-illust.com), Clipart Library (http://clipart-library.com), Silhouette Design (http://kage-design.com/)). Example images are shown in Fig. \[fig3\]. Of these 305 images, 240 images (80 images in each class) were used for training of the CNNs and 65 images were used as the test data set. The size of each image was 50$\times$50 pixels and the intensity of the images was normalized between 0 and 1 by dividing each intensity by 255.

To increase the accuracy even with the small number of images, k-fold cross validation was used. A training data set with 240 images was randomly divided into four groups (60 images per group), and four CNNs with the same structure were trained by using three groups (180 images) as training data sets and one group (60 images) as a validation data set (Fig. \[fig3\]). In each training of CNN, the group of validation data was changed. Each training was conducted up to 40 epochs, and the number of steps at one epoch to update the weights of the CNNs was set at 20 \[8\]. Within 40 epochs, weights resulting in the minimum loss function of the validation data set were conserved. Because the number of training images was not sufficient, the batch size was set at 180 and the training images were increased by rotating between -180$^{\circ}$ and +180$^{\circ}$ and by shifting up to 10% of the width and height of the images \[8\]. After trainings of the CNNs, the accuracy of the test data set was calculated from the mean probability by using the conserved weights of the four CNNs (Fig. \[fig4\]).

An image of the lunar maria is shown in Fig. \[fig4\]. The lunar maria are represented in black color and other effects such as the round shape of the moon itself and the color variations in the maria are removed because the purpose of this work was to evaluate the probability that the CNN can recognize and categorize the lunar maria pattern into the three animals.

We claim that the projection $p: \mathbb T^2 \rightarrow \mathbb S^2$ maps the semi-positive metric (\[metric2\]) to a proper Riemannian metric on $\mathbb S^2$ with induced smooth structure. Indeed, we need to check only that this works in the vicinity of the 4 fixed points.

Let us check this at the point $(0,0).$ If $x\approx \beta_2$ then $P(x)\approx c(x-\beta_2),\, c=P'(\beta_2),$ $$u_1=\int_{\beta_2}^{x_1}\frac{2dx}{\sqrt{P(x)}}\approx \int_{\beta_2}^{x_1}\frac{2dx}{\sqrt{c(x-\beta_1)}}=\frac{4}{\sqrt{c}}\sqrt{x_1-\beta_2}.$$ Thus near $(0,0)$ we have $
x_1\approx \beta_2+Cu_1^2, \,\, x_2\approx \beta_2-Cu_2^2, \,\, C=\sqrt{c}/4,
$ and thus $
x_1+x_2\approx 2\beta_2, \,\, x_1-x_2\approx C(u_1^2+u_2^2),\,\, x_1^2-x_2^2 \approx 2C\beta_2(u_1^2+u_2^2).
$

Thus locally metric (\[metric2\]) has the form $
ds^2\approx 2C\beta_2(u_1^2+u_2^2)(du_1^2+du_2^2)=2C\beta_2z\bar z dzd\bar z,
$ where we introduced complex coordinate $z=u_1+iu_2.$ The involution $\sigma$ acts by $z\to -z$, so the complex coordinate on the quotient is $w=z^2=v_1+iv_2$, in which metric takes regular form $
ds^2\approx \frac{1}{2}C\beta_2dwd\bar

Finally, let us compare the superconducting behavior for $x$=0.45, 0.5 and 0.55. Figure 12 shows the ac-susceptibility (ac-$\chi$) measured using our NQR coil. Although it is hard to determine the onset temperature of the superconductivity from ac-$\chi$, it can be seen that the mid-point of the transition increases in the order of $x$=0.55, 0.5 and 0.45. $T_c$ determined from the point at which $1/T_1$ displays a distinct drop is 0.8 K, 0.9 K and 0.94 K for $x$=0.55, 0.5 and 0.45, respectively. Figure 13 shows $1/T_1$ normalized by its value at $T_c$ plotted against the reduced temperature $T/T_c$ for $x$=0.55, 0.5 and 0.45. Just below $T_c$, $1/T_1$ shows identical behavior for all samples, but at lower temperatures strong variation is observed. In particular, below $T\sim$ 0.4 K, $1/T_1$ becomes again proportional to $T$, and the normalized value of $1/T_1$ increases in the order $x$=0.55, 0.5 and 0.45.

In this section, we provide method that accomplish $1-1/e$ approximation ratio for problem \[eq:ML\_submodular\_sample\_avg\] . In high level, we use the continuous optimization method and dependent rounding technique in [@balkanski2016learning] to obtain a solution.\

**New Ground Set:** Similar to [@balkanski2016learning], we define new ground set of size $nm+n$ which has the orginal ground set elements and element for every $(element, function)$ pair ${\mathcal{X}}^{'}=V \cup \{a_{i,j}\}_{i\in[n],j\in[m]}$.

$$\label{eq:cont reformulation}
    g(S)=\sum_{j=1}^{m} f_j(\{a_i: a_{i,j}\in S\})$$

\
\
**Continuous problem:** let us associate with each element $a_{i}$ a variable $x_i \in [0,1]$ and for each element $a_{i,j}$ a variable $x_{i,j} \in [0,1]$; then, we define the $G(x)$ as in : $$\label{eq:cont obj1}
    G(x)= \mathbb{E}_{s \sim D(x)}g(S)$$ where $D(x)$ is the following distribution:

1.  $a_i \in S \sim D(x)$ for each i independently with probability $x_i$

2.  $a_{i,j} \in S \sim D(x)$ for each i and for each j independently with probability $\frac{x_{i,j}}{x_i}$ if $a_i \in S$ and with probability 0 otherwise.

we can write the continuous version of the problem as note that the difference between this problem and two-stage submodular problem shows itself in .

In this work we focus on the non-studied before regime of global torsional Alfvén nodeless vibrations of neutron star about axis of Ferraro’s magnetic field (\[e1.10\])-(\[e1.12\]). In Section 2, the frequency spectrum of this toroidal mode is derived and compared with the frequency spectrum (\[e1.8\]) of the neutron star model with homogeneous internal magnetic field. In Section 3, the obtained spectral formula for the frequency is analyzed numerically in juxtaposition with data on QPOs during the flare of SGR 1806-20 and SGR 1900+14. Section 4 briefly accounts for the net outcome of this work. Technical details of analytic computations can be found in Appendix.

In the model under consideration a neutron star is identified with a finite spherical mass of an elastic solid, regarded as an incompressible continuous medium of uniform density $\rho$ and an infinite electrical conductivity, whose vibrations under the action of Lorentz magnetic force are governed by equations of magneto-solid-mechanics (\[e1.2\]) which can conveniently be represented in the following equivalent tensor form (e.g. Mestel 1999) $$\begin{aligned}
  \label{e2.1}
  &&\rho{\ddot u}_i=\nabla_k\, \delta M_{ik},\quad \delta M_{ik} =\frac{1}{4\pi}[B_i\,\delta B_k+B_k\,\delta B_i-(B_j\,\delta B_j)\delta_{ik}], \\
  && \delta B_i({\bf r},t)=(B_k \nabla_k)u_i-(u_k\nabla_k) B_i,\quad \nabla_i u_i=0
  \end{aligned}$$ where $\delta M_{ik}$ stands for the Maxwell’s tensor of magnetic field stresses. The energy balance in the process of vibrations is controlled by equation $$\begin{aligned}
 \label{e2.2}
 && \frac{\partial }{\partial t}\int \frac{\rho{\dot u}^2}{2}\,d{\cal V}
 =- \int \delta M_{ik}\,{\dot u}_{ik}\,d{\cal V}=-\frac{1}{8\pi

![Dependences of the total radiation energy on the length of the discharge gap obtained along to the ferrite surface (radiation detectors in positions 2 and 7 in Fig. 1a.). Inset shows the corresponding dependence obtained in the perpendicular direction \[1,2\]](FIG3.pdf){width="80mm"}

Here, $R$ = 75 $\Omega$ is the detector load resistance, $V(t)$ is the instantaneous value of the signal, measured in Volts, at time $t$, $C$ is the detector sensitivity. The duration of the radiation pulse may turn out to be significantly less than the time resolution of the recording channel ($\sim$2 ns), and the pulse duration and shape cannot be obtained by electrical measurements only. Nevertheless, since the signal spectral width (see Table \[tab:table1\]) is scarcely beyond the region of the detector spectral sensitivity (10 eV – 4 keV), relation (1) can be used to estimate the total energy incident on the detector. The value of $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} V(t)dt$ was determined as the area under the curve $V(t)$ (see Fig. 2a). During measurements, the length of the ferrite working part was varied from 1.5 cm to 7 cm by changing the lenght of the negative electrode. In several series of experiments, the length of the working part was first increased (2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 cm), and next decreased (6.5, 5.5, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, and 1 cm). At each length in each series, 2 or 3 consecutive shots were made, with the total length of the ferrite sample being constant. For estimates, the beam cross section was considered a rectangle with dimensions $s = 1$ cm (width) and $h = 0.2$ cm (height). The value of h is smaller than the transverse dimensions of the detector crystals (detector active area is of circle shape with the radius $r_{D}\approx3$ mm); consequently, the total energy transferred by the radiation pulse is

$$E = \varepsilon \frac{d}{r_{D}}.$$

We empirically validate each statement above. The first statement says that, on average, a user’s friends are better connected than he or she is, i.e., they follow more people than he or she does. To validate this statement, for each user in the dataset we count how many friends she has, i.e., how many other users she follows. Then, for each friend, we count how many other users the friend follows, and average over all friends. Top Figure \[fig:friend\_paradox\]($i$) plots the average number of friends-of-friends (ordinate axis) vs the number of friends (abscissa) a user follows for the users with fewer than 1000 friends. About 99.7% of users had fewer than 1000 friends. The line of unit slope shows equality of connectedness.

Denote the image of $[0,1]$ under $\gamma$ by $\Gamma$. From our bounds for the values of $\beta$ at $t=0$ and $t=1$ from property (P1), it follows that we can extend the union $\Gamma\cup (-\Gamma)$ to the image of a closed $C^1$-curve $\bar{\Gamma}$, by gluing arcs $R$ and $-R$ to $\Gamma$ and $-\Gamma$, such that the tangential directions at the gluing points agree, as illustrated in Figure \[fig\_counterex\_4\].

Recall that by property (P1), $\beta$ is injective. Thus, $\bar{\Gamma}$ is a simply closed curve that bounds a strictly convex, antipodally symmetric subset of ${\mathbb{R}}^2$ with non-empty interior. Hence, $\bar{\Gamma}$ defines a norm ${\|{{\mkern 2mu\cdot\mkern 2mu}}\|}$ on ${\mathbb{R}}^2$ by setting $S_{{{}^{\text{\scalebox{0.8}{$\|{{\mkern 2mu\cdot\mkern 2mu}}\|$}}}}}^{1}:=\bar{\Gamma}$. Moreover, since $\beta(t)$ is tangential to $\bar{\Gamma}$ at $\gamma(t)\in \bar{\Gamma}$ for $t\in [0,1]$, the Gauss map $G:S^1_{{{}^{\text{\scalebox{0.8}{$\|{{\mkern 2mu\cdot\mkern 2mu}}\|$}}}}}\to S^1$ of the norm ${\|{{\mkern 2mu\cdot\mkern 2mu}}\|}$ in such points is given by $$\label{eq22}
G(\gamma(t))=R_{\tfrac{\pi}{2}}\beta(t),$$ where $R_{\tfrac{\pi}{2}}$ denotes the counterclockwise rotation about the angle $\tfrac{\pi}{2}$. Recall that by property (P2), ${\mathscr{H}}^1(\beta (K))>0$. Thus, implies that ${\mathscr{H}}^1 G(\gamma(t))>0$, where $G$ denotes the Gauss map of the arc $\Gamma$ parameterized by $\gamma$. This proves Theorem \[thm\_counter\] given properties (P1) and (P2) for $\beta$.\
Thus, we are left to prove that $\beta

Numerical verification
======================

Numerical simulation is performed to test the mixing cut IMEHC for measuring two-pion Bose-Einstein correlations in reactions with $\pi \pi X$ final state particles. In the simulation, the reaction $\gamma p\to \pi^0 \pi^0 p$ with and without BEC effects is taken as an example to demonstrate the event mixing method. The event samples are generated using a ROOT [@Brun1997] utility named “TGenPhaseSpace” [@James1968]. The details of the event generation can be found elsewhere [@He2016]. Totally six $\gamma p\to \pi^0 \pi^0 p$ event samples with and without BEC effects at incident photon energies of 1.0 GeV, 1.03 GeV, 1.06 GeV, 1.09 GeV, 1.12 GeV, and 1.15 GeV respectively are generated.

Although the obtained correlation functions of the non-BEC samples have not any enhancements at $Q=0$ and have a semi-flat distribution averagely as shown in Fig. \[Fig1\] (a), they exhibit a $Q^2$ dependent pattern. Thus the quadratic function $f(Q)=N(1+αQ^2)$ is used to fit the non-BEC correlation functions. Because of the $Q^2$ dependent pattern of the non-BEC sample correlation functions has a strong association with the BEC-samples correlation function fitting, the later should be fitted by a modified Eq. (\[eqn2\]): $$C_{BEC} (Q)=N(1+\alpha Q^2)(1+\lambda_2 e^{-r_0^2 Q^2}),                                                                    
\label{eqn3}$$

The ability of the proposed mixing method to measure BEC effects is tested using the six BEC samples with input BEC parameters typically set to be $r_0=0.8$ fm and $\lambda_2=$1.0. As shown in Fig. \[Fig1\] (a), the BEC effects can be successfully observed in the obtained correlation functions using the proposed mixing method.

Let $a,b, p,q \in \Bbb C$, $q\ne 0$. Define the generalised Fibonacci sequence $\{W_n \} = \{ W_n(a,b\, ; p,q)\}$ by $W_0=a$, $W_1 = b$, $$W_n= pW_{n-1} -qW_{n-2}.\eqno(1.1)$$

Obviously the definition can be extended to negative subscripts ; that is, for $n = 1, 2, 3,\cdots, $ define $$W_{-n} = (pW_{-n+1} -W_{-n+2})/q.\eqno (1.2)$$

In the case $a=0$, $b=1$, following \[Ho\], we shall denote the sequence $\{ W_n
  (0,1\,;\, p,q)\}$ by $\{u_n\}$. Equivalently, $$u_n =  W_n(0,1\, ; p,q).\eqno(1.3)$$

Note that $u_{-n} = -q^{-n} u_n$. In this article, we will give a unified proof of various identities involving $W_n$. The alternative proof presented in this article (for Melham’s, Howard’s and Horadam’s identities) uses nothing but [*recurrence*]{} which is slightly different from the original proof.

Recurrence Relation
===================

[**Lemma 2.1.**]{} [*$ A(n) = W_{2n}$, $B(n) =W_{n}W_{n+r}$ and $C(n) = q^n$ satisfy the following recurrence relation*]{} [$$X(n+3) = (p^2-q)X(n+2) +(q^2-p^2q)X(n+1)+q^3X(n).\eqno (2.1)$$]{}

[*Proof.*]{} One sees easily that $q^n$ satisfies

We emphasize now the difference between the uncertainty captured by specifying a distribution as the neural network’s output, as discussed here, and the uncertainty in the weight distribution, as discussed in Section \[section:bnn\]. The former corresponds to the irreducible pure randomness, while the latter reflects uncertainty in parameter estimation.

Data and Model
==============

In this section, we describe the data used for our experiments and the proposed model. The dataset used and relevant code are available on GitHub.[^2] The experiments are implemented using the R programming language [@rdevelopmentcoreteamLanguageEnvironment2011] and TensorFlow [@tensorflow2015-whitepaper].

Data
----

We utilize the individual claims history simulator of [@gabrielliIndividualClaims2018] to generate data for our experiments. For each claim, we have the following static information: line of business, labor sector of the injured, accident year, accident quarter, age of the injured, part of body injured, and the reporting year. In addition, we also have 12 years of claim development information, in the form of cash flows and claims statuses (whether the claim is open or not). The generated claims history exhibit behaviors such as negative cash flows for recoveries and late reporting, which mimic realistic scenarios.

Since we only have claims data and not policy level and exposure data, we study only reported claims.

Experiment Setup
----------------

We first simulate approximately 500,000[^3] claims using the simulator, which provides us with the full development history of these claims. The claims cover accident years 1994 to 2005. Since we are concerned with reported claims, we remove claims with report date after 2005, which leaves us with N = 497,516 claims. In this paper, we assume that each claim is fully developed at development year 11 (note that in the dataset the first development year is denoted year 0). More formally, we can represent the dataset as the collection

$$\mathcal{D} = \{ (X^{(j)}, (C_i^{(j)})_{0 \leq i \leq 11}, (S_i^{(j)})_{0 \leq i \leq 11}): j\in {1,\dots, N}\},$$

where $X$, $(C_i)$, and $(S_i)$ denote the static claim features, incremental cash flow sequences, and claim status sequences, respectively, and $j$ indexes the claims.

To create the training and testing sets, we select year

In the literature, different implementations of the above ideas can be found. The minimal requirements for the updates are however nothing more than the ones shown in the Figs. \[fig:LOWA\_insert\] and  \[fig:LOWA\_kink\], combined with a move update which moves the position of the worm head forward or backward in imaginary time without changing the kinks. We will therefore only briefly mention the key ideas and refer to the relevant papers. Prokof’ev, Svistunov and Tupitsyn were the first to introduce the worm algorithm [@Prokofev1998_worm]. They formulated it for the Bose-Hubbard model in the grand-canonical ensemble in the path integral representation. Sandvik and Sylju[å]{}sen introduced worm operators for spin models in the stochastic series representation with directed loop updates [@Sandvik1999; @Syljuasen2003]. It is worth remarking that the loop algorithm was the first algorithm formulated in continuous imaginary time ([*i.e.,* ]{} free of Trotter discretization error) to overcome the critical slowing down near the second order phase transition [@Evertz1993; @Beard1996; @Evertz2003], even before the worm algorithm was invented. Pollet [*et al.*]{} tried to combine the two algorithms and formulated the worm algorithm in the path integral representation but with directed loops [@Pollet2007]. Rombouts [*et al.*]{} formulated a worm algorithm in the canonical ensemble by letting the worm head and the worm tail propagate simultaneously in imaginary time, thereby creating and annihilating a particle on different sites simultaneously [@Rombouts2006; @VanHoucke2006]. These ideas were picked up by Rousseau [*et al.*]{} in formulating algorithms with multiple worms (called stochastic Green functions) [@Rousseau2007; @Rousseau2008]. In  [@Kawashima2004] a review of world-line Monte Carlo methods up to 2003 can be found with a discussion on the loop algorithm, directed loops algorithm and the worm algorithm. Classical worm algorithms have also been formulated [@Prokofev2001; @Prokofev2009; @Alet2003]. These algorithms can, in particular, be used to efficiently simulate quantum criticality in cases when the universality class can be mapped onto a higher dimensional classical model (cf. Sec. \[sec:WIBG\_Tc\]).

The physics of the 3D Bose-Hubbard model in a nutshell

On the Backward Heat Equation
=============================

In this section, let’s consider the backward heat equation $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}=-\Delta f,$$ if we use $\tau$ to denote a variable $\tau(t)$ satisfying $\frac{\partial\tau}{\partial t}=-1$, then we shall have $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial\tau}=\Delta f.$$

Then by the same proof as in section 2, 3, 4, we directly get

Let $(M,g)$ be a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $n$ and with nonnegative Ricci curvature. Let $f$ be a positive solution to the backward heat equation (5.1); $u=-\ln f$, $\tau=\tau(t)$ with $\frac{\partial\tau}{\partial t}=-1$ and $$H=2\Delta{u}-{{\left\lvert{\nabla}{u}\right\rvert}}^2-\frac{2n}{\tau}.$$ Then for all time $\tau>0$, $$H\leq0.$$

and

Let $(M,g)$ be a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $n$ and with nonnegative Ricci curvature. Let $f$ be a positive solution to the backward heat equation (5.1); $v=-\ln f -\frac{n}{2}\ln(4\pi \tau)$, $\tau=\tau(t)$ with $\frac{\partial\tau}{\partial t}=-1$ and $$P=2\Delta{v}-{{\left\lvert{\nabla}{v}\right\rvert}}^2-\frac{2n}{\tau}.$$ Then for all time $\tau>0$, $$P\leq0.$$

Let $(M,g)$ be a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $n$ and with nonnegative Ricci curvature. Let $f$ be a positive solution to the backward heat equation (5.1);\
Let $f=e^{-u}$, $\tau=\tau(t)$ with $\frac{\partial\tau}{\partial t}=-1$ and we define $$F=\int_{M}({\tau}^2{\left\lvert{\nabla}u\right\rvert}^2-2n\tau)e^{-u}dV_{g},$$ then for all time $\tau>0$, $$F\leq0$$ and $$\frac{\partial F}{\partial t}\geq0.$$

and

Let $(M.g)$ be a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $n$ and with nonnegative Ricci

For a graph $G=(V,E)$, an “edge length assignment” is a vector $\lambda\in{\mathbb R}^E$ indexed by the edges with positive real coordinates $\lambda_e$, $e\in E$. A configuration of $(V,E,\lambda)$ is a collection $(\rho_v)_{v\in V}$ with $\rho_v\in{\mathbb R}^2$, such that for any edge $e=(u,v)$, we have $||\rho_u-\rho_v||=\lambda_e$. Two configurations $\rho,\rho'$ are equivalent if there is a direct isometry $\sigma:{\mathbb R}^2\to{\mathbb R}^2$ of the plane such that $\sigma(\rho_v)=\rho'_v$ for all $v$. If we choose two vertices $v,w\in V$ such that $\rho_v\ne\rho_w$, then there is a unique representative $\rho'$ in the equivalence class of $\rho$ such $\rho_v=(0,0)$ and $\rho_w=(0,c)$ for some $c>0$; we then say that $\rho'$ is a [*normalized*]{} configuration.

For a given graph $G=(V,E)$ with edge length assignment $\lambda$, its normalized configurations are the solutions of a system of algebraic equations of the form $$(x_a-x_b)^2+(y_a-y_b)^2 = \lambda_{ab}^2$$ for each edge $\{a,b\}\in E$, and the normalization conditions $$x_v=y_v=x_w=0, y_w>0 .$$ The number of nonzero variables is $2|V|-3$, and the number of equations is $|E|$. We leave out the inequality, because it is inessential for the dimension count. Now the CGK formula predicts that the linkage is rigid if $2|V|-3=|E|$. If this number is nonnegative, then we call $2|V|-3-|E|$ the CGK estimate for the dimension of equivalence classes of configurations. In kinematics, this dimension is called the [*mobility*]{} of the linkage.

Introduction
============

One of the most promising projects in todays high energy physics is an electron-positron linear collider, for example TESLA [@tesla]. At such a linear collider one should be able to polarize the electrons with the same technology as at the SLC to up to $80\%$. At TESLA it should also be possible to run with positrons polarized up to $60\%$ [@tesla]. With a luminosity of ${\cal L} \simeq 5 \cdot 10^{33} 
{\rm cm}^{-2} 
{\rm s}^{-1}$ at energies close to the peak of the Z-resonance TESLA could produce $10^9$ Z-bosons in about 70 days of running [@tesla]. In this scenario, often referred to as GigaZ, the measurements already performed at the electron-positron collider experiments at LEP and SLC could be redone with increased precision.

An interesting topic is the test of the CP symmetry in Z decays. There is already a number of theoretical ([@othertheo1]-[@4jetg] and references therein) and experimental [@alephtautau92]-[@thilo] studies of this subject. In the present paper we will study a flavor-diagonal Z decay where CP-violating effects within the Standard Model (SM) are estimated to be very small [@zdecay]. Thus, looking for CP violation in such Z decays means looking for new physics beyond the SM.

For a model-independent systematic analysis of CP violation in Z decays we use the effective Lagrangian approach as described in [@zdecay; @xsec]. Of particular interest are Z decays involving heavy leptons or quarks. Thus, the

On the other hand, we can also say that, although the width of the wave packet almost doesn’t increase as time passes by, even if we perfectly confine the position of center of mass in a given small region of space, at time $t=0$ s, a fraction of a second after its wave function will have acquired an infinite tail. The value of this tail will be infinitesimally small, but nevertheless different from zero. So, let us estimate this value, at a distance of $50$ km, after exactly one second of free evolution.

The body’s center of mass wave packet can be written as the product of three identical Gaussian factors: $|\psi_t({\bf x})|^2= |\psi_t(x_1)|^2 |\psi_t(x_2)|^2|\psi_t(x_3)|^2$, where: $$|\psi_t(x_i)|^2=\sqrt{2\over\pi a^2}{1\over \sqrt{1 + {4\hbar^2 t^2 \over M^2a^4}}}\exp\left[-{{2a^2\left(x_i-{\hbar k_i\over M}t \right)^2}\over a^4 + {4\hbar^2 t^2 \over M^2}}\right],\quad i=1,2,3.
\label{gaussian}$$ To evaluate $|\psi_t({\bf x})|^2$, at time $t=1$ s, we can set $k_1=k_2=k_3=0$ (the body is at rest at time $t=0$ s), $x_2=x_3=0$ m, $x_1\approx 5\times 10^4$ m, $M=10^2$ kg, and $a = 2r_0 \approx 10^{-10}$ m. This implies that $|\psi_1(x_2)|^2=|\psi_1(x_3)|^2\approx 10^{10}$, and $|\psi_1(x)|^2\approx 10^{10}\times e^{-5\times 10^{29}}$. Multiplying the probability density $|\psi_t({\bf x})|^2$ by the volume of the micro-sphere of Bohr radius in which we want the center of mass to relocate,

(See [@Mustafa]) Let $(X, G)$ be a $G$-metric space. A sequence $\{x_n \}$ is called a $G$-Cauchy sequence if for any $\varepsilon > 0$, there is $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $G (x_n , x_m , x_l ) < \varepsilon$ for all $n, m, l \geq N$, that is $G (x_n , x_m , x_l ) \to 0$ as $n, m,l \to +\infty$. We shall use interchangeably “$G$-Cauchy sequence in a $G$-metric space" or “Cauchy sequence in a $G$-metric space".

(Compare [@Mustafa Proposition 9])

In a $G$-metric space $(X,G)$, the following are equivalent

-   The sequence $(x_n) \subseteq X$ is $G$-Cauchy.

-   For each $\varepsilon >0$ there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $G(x_n,x_m,x_m)< \varepsilon$ for all $m,n\geq N$.

(Compare [@Mustafa Definition 9]) A $G$-metric space $(X,G)$ is $G$-complete if every $G$-Cauchy sequence of elements of $(X,G)$ is $G$-convergent in $(X,G)$. We shall use interchangeably “$G$-complete $G$-metric space" or “complete $G$-metric space".

\[theorem1\](See [@Mustafa]) A $G$-metric $G$ on a $G$-metric space $(X, G)$ is continuous on its three variables.

Let $(X,G)$ be a $G$-metric space. A function $T:X\to X$ is called **sequentially continuous** if for any $G$-convergent sequence $(x_n)$ with $x_n\longrightarrow x $, the sequence $(Tx_n)$ $G$-converges to $Tx$, i.e. $Tx_n \longrightarrow Tx $.

Similarly, a function $T:X_1\times X_2\times \cdots \times X_n \to X$ for $n\geq 2,$ is said to be **sequentially continuous** if for any sequences $(

Let $g$ denote the ground as well as the single bound state of the potential $U_1(\rho)$ \[Eq. (\[Un\_potentials\])\], and $c$ a low-lying odd (unbound) state of the continuum spectrum, which is normalized to the delta function. Then, $Z_{cg}(R) \equiv Z_{gc}(R) \equiv 0$ since the $g\to c$ transition is forbidden in Fig. \[Fig\_potentials\](a) ; respectively, $Z_{gg}(R) \equiv 0$ in Fig. \[Fig\_potentials\](b). The first nonzero effective potentials in Figs. \[Fig\_potentials\](a) and \[Fig\_potentials\](b) are $Z_{gg}(R)$ and $Z_{cg}(R)$, respectively, and they are plotted in Fig. \[Fig\_effective\_potentials\]. Taking into account that $E_g - \bar{E}_1 \approx E_{cm} = 1$ (a.u.) ($E_g$ being the ground state energy) is the kinetic energy of the center of mass, we may qualitatively conclude from Fig. \[Fig\_effective\_potentials\] that the center of mass needs to tunnel through the barrier \[$Z_{gg}(R)$\] in Fig. \[Fig\_potentials\](a) and flies above the barrier \[$Z_{cg}(R)$\] in Fig. \[Fig\_potentials\](b); thus, the probability of finding the particle in the first quadrant in Fig. \[Fig\_potentials\](b) prevails over the probability of tunneling in Fig. \[Fig\_potentials\](a). Finally, we note that the first nonzero effective potentials in Figs. \[Fig\_potentials\](c) and \[Fig\_potentials\](d) are of the same order; the same statement is valid in cases Figs. \[Fig\_potentials\](e) and \[Fig\_potentials\](f).

Apolarity {#apolaritySEC}
=========

In this section we will briefly recall some basic facts from [*Apolarity Theory*]{} or, in modern terms, [*Inverse Systems Theory*]{}. Comprehensive references are [@Ge], mainly Lecture 2, 6 and 8, and [@IaKa].

Consider the polynomial rings $$S=k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\mbox{ and }T=k[\partial_1,\ldots,\partial_n],$$ where $k$ denotes a field of characteristic 0, and give $S$ a $T$-module structure via differentiation, i.e. we will think of $T$ as the ring of differential operators acting on $S$. We denote this action with “$\circ$”, e.g. $\partial_j\circ
f=\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} f$ for $f\in S$.

There is a natural perfect paring between homogeneous pieces of the same degree of $S$ and $T$, namely $$\begin{array}{ccccl}
S_i & \times & T_i & \longrightarrow & k \\
f   &        & D   &                 & D\circ f
\end{array},$$ is a perfect pairing for all $i$; in particular, $S_i$ and $T_i$ are dual to each other. Given subspaces, $$V\subseteq S_i\mbox{ and } W\subseteq T_i$$ we denote by $$V^\perp\subseteq T_i\mbox{ and } W^\perp\subseteq S_i$$ their orthogonal with respect to this pairing; notice, e.g., that $\dim_k V + \dim_k V^\perp =\dim_k S_i=\dim_k T_i$.

Given a form $f\in S_d$, the ideal $$f^\perp=\{D\in T : D\circ f=0\}$$ is a homogeneous ideal of $T$ and it is called the [*orthogonal*]{} ideal of $f$.



We now investigate the structure of the rational points on each individual line, starting with a line $L({{\underline{\mathrm{c}}}})$, where ${{\underline{\mathrm{c}}}}$ is primitive.

\[lem:Diomain\] Let $c_1,c_2,r\in \scrO $ satisfying $\gcd(c_1,c_2,r)=1$. Then we have the following equality of residues modulo $r$: $$\{{\underline{\mathrm{a}}}\bmod{r}: \gcd({\underline{\mathrm{a}}},r)=1,{{\underline{\mathrm{c}}}}\cdot{\underline{\mathrm{a}}}\equiv 0\bmod{r}, |{\underline{\mathrm{a}}}|<|r|\}=\{a{{\underline{\mathrm{c}}}}^\bot\bmod{r}: |a|<|r|, \gcd(a,r)=1\},$$ where ${{\underline{\mathrm{c}}}}^\bot=(-c_2,c_1)^t$.

We will assume that $r={\varpi}^k$, for some prime ${\varpi}$. Without loss of generality, we can assume that ${\varpi}\nmid c_1$. Clearly, modulo $r$, the left hand side is equal to $$\{y(-c_1^{-1}c_2,1):\gcd(y,r)=1, y\bmod{r}\}=\{yc_1(-c_1^{-1}c_2,1):\gcd(y,r)=1, y\bmod{r}\}.$$ In general, if $r={\varpi}_1^{k_1}...{\varpi}_m^{k_m}$ is a prime decomposition of $r$ into co-prime prime powers, then our previous analysis shows that ${{\underline{\mathrm{c}}}}\cdot {\underline{\mathrm{a}}}\equiv 0\bmod{r}$ would necessarily imply that for each $1\leq i\leq m$, there exists $b_i$ such that ${\varpi}_i\nmid b_i$ and ${\underline{\mathrm{a}}}\equiv b_i{{\underline{\mathrm{c}}}}^\perp \bmod{{\varpi}_i^{k_i}}$ . An application of the Chinese remainder theorem will finish the proof of the lemma.

As a direct corollary of Lemma \[lem:Diomain\], we get

Documenting hadron states with predominantly gluonic degrees of freedom, i.e. glueballs, has been a challenging and somewhat elusive pursuit. Even though such states are consistent with quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and predicted by both lattice simulations [@bali; @sexton; @morningstar; @lucini] and gluonic models [@ssjc; @flsc], clear experimental evidence is lacking. The purpose of this letter is to motivate additional experimental investigations by providing estimates, based upon VMD, of tensor glueball photoproduction observables and also to detail a possible decay signature for hadronic states with a significant gluonic component. The latter entails comparable $VV'$ hadronic widths, with the largest branch to $\omega
\phi$ that promptly goes to $3 \pi K \bar{K}$, and somewhat suppressed $\omega \gamma$ and $\phi \gamma$ radiative decays relative to $\rho \gamma$. As discussed below, this decay signature is not expected for hadrons with a predominantly quark structure. These results are essentially model-independent since they follow directly from the general principles of VMD, which has been found to agree with more fundamental QCD based meson radiative calculations [@scpm], and the flavor independence of quark-gluonic couplings.

Consider the radiative decay $f_2 \rightarrow V(k') \gamma(k)$ of a neutral tensor hadron with arbitrary quark, gluon structure and mass $M_f$. Here $k$, $k'$ are the momenta of the photon and vector meson with mass $M_V$ ($k'^2 = M_V^2$). The most general, gauge invariant $f_2V
\gamma$ vertex is  [@ren; @ol] $$\begin{aligned}

For this reason, we must ensure that different “sampleable” policies get reward from different states. As a first step, we make a couple of definitions to say which states provide reward to which policies. The concepts of \[def:value-support\] are illustrated in \[fig:value-support\].

A CRMDP $\mu$ is *unichain* if any stationary policy $\pi:\S\to\Delta\A$ induces a stationary distribution $d_\pi$ on $\S$ that is independent of the initial state $s_0$.

\[def:value-support\] In a unichain CRMDP, let the *asymptotic value contribution* of $s$ to $\pi$ be $\vc^\pi(s)=d_\pi(s)\orf(s)$. We say that a set $\S^\delta_i$ is *$\delta$-value supporting* a policy $\pi_i$ if $$\forall s\in\S^\delta_i\colon \vc^{\pi_i}(s)\geq \delta/|\S^\delta_i|.$$

We are now ready to define a general $\delta$-Quantilising agent. The definition is for theoretical purposes only. It is unsuitable for practical implementation both because of the extreme data and memory requirements of Step 1, and because of the computational complexity of Step 2. Finding a practical approximation is left for future research.

\[def:gen-quant\] In a unichain CRMDP,

When only phase modulation is used, it is not possible to cluster 4 points with equal distance to the original point. As a result this constellation is not expected to perform as well as the QAM schemes. The results shown in Fig. \[psk\_error\_v\_blatancy\] and Fig. \[psk\_error\_v\_quality\] confirm this to be the case.

While $\beta = 1.0$ corresponds to a standard 16-PSK constellation, some secret symbols are spread very far from their corresponding legacy symbols. Hence, very high blatancy interferes with the cover much more than in either of the QAM schemes. Fig. \[psk\_error\_v\_blatancy\] shows that this is the case even for the relatively high signal quality of 25 dB. Here there is a relatively small range of feasible blatancy, roughly 0.5 to 0.7. Because of this, tuning would be more difficult with this level of signal quality, especially in varying conditions, though an automatic solution would be able to provide a reliable channel. The same quality, 25 dB, is shown here to facilitate direct comparison with the other constellations, but realistically a higher SNR would be required for good performance with 4x4-PSK. As can be seen in Fig. \[psk\_error\_v\_quality\], at around 28 dB near-perfect performance is possible with $\beta = 0.6$.

While the effects of blatancy manipulation here are considerably more sporadic and unpredictable, the signal does show a predicable improvement in error rate as quality increases. With higher signal quality the range of feasible blatancies would be wider, making manual or automatic tuning simpler.

The 4x4-PSK constellation results in a signal that is both more obvious and less robust than either QAM arrangement. However, these results show that constellation-based steganography is possible in a context where only phase modulation is possible.

Stealth
=======

Due to noise, symbol points as decoded by a receiver differ from the ideal constellation. The stealth of each scheme can thus be visualised as a scatter plot of the received points. Such a plot for a stealthy signal looks like a noisy legacy constellation, but the secret constellation is visible for a less stealthy signal. Because a transmission is composed of many thousands of symbols, a histogram is shown on each axis to better illustrate their distribution. This plot is

Introduction
============

The minimization of the Mumford-Shah functional has been introduced in the framework of image analysis as a simple and yet powerful variational method for image-segmentation problems (see, [[*e.g.*]{}, ]{}[@AuKo; @MSreview; @MoSo; @VeCha]. In this field, a main task consists in detecting relevant object contours of (possibly distorted) digital images. Representing a gray-scale image on a domain $D\subset {\mathbb{R}}^{d}$ as a function $g:D\to[0,1]$ encoding at each point of $D$ the gray-level of the image, a “cartoon" version of $g$ is obtained by minimizing in the pair $(u,K)$ the functional $$\int_{D\setminus K}|\nabla u|^{2}{\,\mathrm{d}x}+\beta\,\mathcal{H}^{d-1}(K)+\gamma\int_{D}|u-g|^2{\,\mathrm{d}x}.$$ In this setting $K\subset D$ is a piece-wise regular and relatively closed set with finite $(d-1)$-dimensional Hausdorff measure $\mathcal{H}^{d-1}$, the function $u$ belongs to $C^{1}(D\setminus K)$ and $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are nonnegative parameters. Loosely speaking, the minimization of the above functional results in a pair $(u,K)$ where $u$ is smooth and close to the input image $g$ outside a set $K$ whose ${\mathcal{H}^{d-1}}$-measure has to be as small as possible. In this sense $K$ may be interpreted as the set of contours of the “cartoon” image $u$, or in other words the set of relevant object contours of $g$. Besides being a simple model for image segmentation (in this case the relevant space dimension is $d=2$), the Mumford-Shah functional has applications also in higher dimensions. The case $d=3$ is particularly important for its mechanical interpretation, as the functional coincides with the Griffith’s fracture energy in the anti-plane case (see [@BFM]).

A weaker formulation of the problem was proposed in [@AmDeG] and led to the introduction of the space $SBV$ of special functions of bounded variation on which the Mumford-Shah functional is defined as $$\label{eq:introMS}
M\!S(u)=\int

Some practical guidance
-----------------------

From our analysis, we see that the value of $\lambda$ affects the coverage rates of the Monte Carlo CIs. This is likely due to the rate at which convergence of the MM estimates to their true values occur. A higher value of $\lambda$, relative to the other parameter values, leads to stronger mixing of the process and faster convergence. This lends better justification for Monte Carlo CIs. While one can rescale the temporal and spatial units of our data to some degree in order to achieve higher $\lambda$ estimates, this leads to a reduction in the area covered by our data and is in conflict with the increasing domain asymptotics underlying some theoretical properties of our estimators.\
One possible way to check if good coverage can be obtained is to calculate coverage proxies based on the empirical distribution of the MM estimates from the fitted model. For example, if we want to compute a proxy for the $95\%$ confidence interval coverage of the Monte Carlo CI for $\theta$, we can define $\theta_{L}$, $\theta_{M}$ and $\theta_{U}$ to be the $2.5^{\text{th}}$ quantile, median and $97.5^{\text{th}}$ quantile of its MM estimates from fitted model simulations. The initial MM estimate used to fit the model, that is the true parameter value of the fitted model, is denoted by $\theta_{E}$. A schematic for these terms is given in Figure \[fig:coverageproxy\].\
We work under the assumption that further simulations using a MM estimate along the range represented by the horizontal line would lead to estimates which have a similar distribution and relation to the true value as the one outlined by $\theta_{L}$, $\theta_{M}$, $\theta_{U}$ and $\theta_{E}$. In Figure \[fig:coverageproxy\], the filled black dots represent the leftmost and rightmost points for which $\theta_{E}$ lies within a 95% CI. Thus, they represent the extreme values that contribute to the calculation of the coverage. With this in mind, a simple coverage proxy can be calculated via: $$CP = ECDF(\theta_{E} + (\theta_{M} - \theta_{L})) - ECDF(\theta_{E} - (\theta_{U} - \theta_{M})),$$ where $ECDF$ is the empirical cumulative distribution function of the MM estimates.\
Table \[table:CoverageProxy\] shows the results when we apply this proxy to Choles

The key to defining a rudimentary $n$-graph suitable to our purposes is to follow the topological maxim, [*‘The boundary of a boundary is zero’*]{}. This principle, so phrased by John Archibald Wheeler [@CW; @MTW], has limitless applications to physics, from Kirchoff’s laws in electrical circuits to the Bianchi identities in general relativity. It is also the topological foundation of Maxwell’s equations themselves, so it is perhaps not so surprising that it plays a foundational role in a precise formulation of lattice electromagnetism.

For us, spacetime will be a **cell complex** $M$, which we define as follows. First of all, $M$ consists of a list of sets $$X_0, X_1, X_2 \ldots , X_k, \ldots$$ where we call $X_k=X_k(M)$ the set of [[****]{}$k$-cells]{} in $M$. Now intuitively, the boundary of a $k$-cell should be a “sum” of $(k-1)$-cells. To formalize such sums, for each $k$ we let $C_k = C_k(M)$ be the free abelian group on the set $X_k$. In other words, $C_k$ just consists of all formal linear combinations of $k$-cells, with integer coefficients. We call the elements of $C_k$ the [[****]{}$k$-chains]{} in $M$. We then hypothesize **boundary maps** $\partial_k{\colon}C_k\rightarrow C_{k-1}$ and require that these be linear over ${\mathbb{Z}}$. If we let $\partial_0{\colon}C_0\to 0$ be the unique map from $C_0$ to the trivial group, then the boundary maps fit together like this: $$0 \buildrel \partial_{0} \over \longleftarrow
C_{0} \buildrel \partial_{1} \over \longleftarrow
C_{1} \buildrel \partial_{2} \over \longleftarrow
C_{2} \buildrel \partial_{3} \over \longleftarrow 
\cdots\buildrel \partial_{k} \over \longleftarrow
C_{k} \buildrel \partial_{k+1} \over \longleftarrow 
\cdots.$$

We will say that the cell

We compute the light curves in [*UBVRI*]{} bands using our code STELLA, which incorporates implicit hydrodynamics coupled to a time-dependent multi-group non-equilibrium radiative transfer (Blinnikov et al., 1998). The specific model employed here was Model 13C of Woosley et al. (1994). This model was derived from a 13 M$_{\odot}$ main sequence star that lost most of its hydrogen envelope to a nearby companion. The main parameters of the model are: total mass 3.8 M$_{\odot}$, radius 600 R$_{\odot}$, mass of $^{56}$Ni 0.11 M$_{\odot}$, explosion energy $1.5 \times 10^{51}$ erg. The chemical composition is shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 7 gives the resulting light curves, and Fig. 8 presents the light curves for the first 50 days past explosion.

The model light curves give a very good fit to the observed maximum, concerning both the luminosity and the shape. The differences are on the rising branch, where the computed early-time peak is brighter than observed, and on the tail, especially for the $U$ and $B$ bands. We consider the agreement to be quite satisfactory, but we continue the search for models which will give better fits. The results and more detailed discussion of the properties of the models and their impact on the possible evolution of the progenitor will be published in a subsequent paper.

Suppose $G$ is disconnected. Without loss of generality, we can order the vertices such that $V_1 = \{1, \ldots, k'\}$ and $V_2 = \{k' + 1, \ldots, k\}$. Suppose $(x_1, \ldots, x_k) \in U$ has minimum energy. Then for all $y \in {\mathbf{R}}^d \setminus \{0\}$ we have $$\begin{gathered}
f(x_1 + y, \ldots, x_{k'} + y, x_{k'} - y, \ldots, x_k - y) \\
= f(x_1, \ldots, x_k)
+ \beta \sum_{i = 1}^{k'} \sum_{j = k' + 1}^k \left( \frac{w_i \, w_j}{\|2 \, y + x_i - x_j\|^{\delta}} - \frac{w_i \, w_j}{\|x_i - x_j\|^{\delta}} \right).\end{gathered}$$ This equation holds because all hyperedges $e_j \in E$ are either completely contained in $V_1$ or completely contained in $V_2$, such that all $x_i$ with $i \in e_j$ are either translated by $+y$ or $-y$, respectively. This ensures that for all hyperedges $e_j \in E$ and vertices $i \in e_j$, the difference $x_i - z_j$ remains the same, which in turn leaves the first term of unchanged. For the second term of , we find that the difference $x_i - x_j$ only changes if $i \in V_1$ and $j \in V_2$, or vice versa.

For all $1 \leq i \leq k'$, $k' < j \leq k$, we have $$\lim_{r \rightarrow \infty} \frac{w_i \, w_j}{\|2 \, (r \, y) + x_i - x_j\|^{\delta}} 
= \lim_{r \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{|r|^{\delta}} \, \frac{w_i \, w_j}{\|2 \, y + (x_i - x_j)/r\|^{\delta}}

Transition-based Dependency Parsing:

:   The most challenging case we evaluate is that of a transition-based system, such as a transition based parser with LSTM-based feature-extraction [@dyer2015stacklstm; @dyer2016rnng; @kiperwasser2016eftreelstm] and exploration-based training [@ballesteros16exploration; @goldberg13dynamic; @bengio15scheduled]. Here, a sequence is encoded using an LSTM (or a bi-LSTM), followed by a series of predictions. Each prediction based on a subset of the encoded vectors, and the vectors that participate in each prediction, as well as the loss, are determined by the outcomes of the previous predictions. Here, batching is harder yet as the nature of the computation interleaves sampling from the model and training, and requires calling <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Forward</span> at each step, leaving the automatic-batcher very little room to play with. However, with only a small change to the computation, we can run $b$ different parsers “in parallel”, and potentially share the computation across the different systems in a given time-step. Concretely, we use a modified version of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bist</span> parser [@kiperwasser2016bilstmparser].

For completeness and standardization of notation, we review the general properties of two dimensional rotors and follow with a discussion of the slave particle representation that bears their name[@rotor-florens-mott].

A rotor in two dimensions is an object that possesses only angular momentum, prototypically of the form $H \propto L^2$ where $L$ is the angular momentum operator about some axis, say the $\hat{z}$ axis. We classify states by the eigenstates of the $L$ operator, $L {\left|n \right>} = n {\left|n \right>}$ where $n$ is an integer. Raising and lowering operators are defined as $${{U}^{\dagger}} {\left|n \right>}  =  {\left|n+1 \right>},   \hspace{30pt}  U  {\left|n \right>}  =  {\left|n-1 \right>},$$ where $U$ is a unitary operator. From this definition it is simple to show that $L$ and $U$ satisfy the commutation relations, $$\left[ L,U \right]      =  U,   \hspace{30pt} \left[ L,{{U}^{\dagger}} \right]  =  -{{U}^{\dagger}}.$$ Since $U$ is unitary it can be written as $U = \exp(-i\theta)$ where ${{\theta}^{\dagger}} = \theta$ and one can show that this implies the canonical commutation relation $[\theta,L] = i$, showing that $L$ and $\theta$ are canonically conjugate variables.

To use these rotors as a slave-particle we associate the local electron basis with the product of the states of slave fermion and the states of an $O(2)$ rotor, $$\begin{aligned}
  {\left|0 \right>}        & = & {\left|0 \right>}_f {\left|+1 \right>}_{\theta} ,\\
  {\left|{\uparrow}\right>}      & = & {\left|{\uparrow}\right>}_f{\left|0 \right>}_{\theta} ,\\
  {\left|{\downarrow}\right>}    & = & {\left|{\downarrow}\right>}_f{\left|0 \right>}_{\theta} ,  \\
  {\left|{\uparrow}{\downarrow}\right>} & = & {\left|{\uparrow

Results for the spectral evolution for initially monochromatic UCN of 70 cm energy, with and without gravity, are shown in Fig. 2. Results of scaled extrapolation of the neutron lifetime however indicated an effect of less than 0.5 sec on the change in the neutron lifetime. Figure 3 shows typical data that was used in this extrapolation. Numerous tests for effects of initial spectrum, bottle emptying procedure, and source loading, were performed. It might be surprising that such a large effect on the UCN spectrum does not lead to a large correction, but insofar as the gravity correction follows the scaling law as used in [@mampe], the effect should not contribute. Indeed, shown in Fig. 4 are the results for storage at time/mfp scaled calculations. It can be seen that the effects of gravity are negligible, in that there is a less than 1% difference in the spectra, and the majority of the spectrum remains with $\pm 10$ cm of the initial energy of 70 cm. Reasonable agreement with the corrections given in [@mampe] was obtained. In addition, the effects of the surface wave was determined by adjusting $f$ for the cases with and without surface wave to give approximately the same loss rate.

With that said, it was not possible to fully model the experiment described in [@mampe] with the available information. This study would be better done in regard to the experiment described in [@aruz], which appears as more complicated, so the simple electrical models used here are not applicable. However, there are enough experimental details that exist in Ph.D. dissertations and published papers to allow construction of a reasonable model of the apparatus described in [@aruz].

Introduction
============

In the recent years, deformations of $\mathbb{R}^3$ for which the algebra of coordinates forms a $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ Lie algebra have received some interest. This was in particular related either to developments in $3$-d gravity, in particular viewing $\mathbb{R}^3$ as the dual algebra of the relativity group [@ritals1; @ritals2], or to constructions of analytic formulas for the star-products [@fedele-vitale] defining these deformations as well as investigations of their structural properties [@lagraa; @selene; @KV-15; @q-grav] (see also [@galuccio; @fedele]). Field theories built on these noncommutative (quantum) spaces have been shown to have a perturbative quantum behaviour different from the one of field theories built on Moyal spaces, at least regarding renormalizability as well as UV/IR mixing [@vitwal; @vit-kust; @wal-16]. For earlier works on noncommutative field theories (NCFT) on Moyal spaces, see e.g [@Grosse:2003aj-pc; @Blaschke:2009c] and references therein.\
The purpose of this paper is to select salient features developed in our recent works [@jpw-16; @tp-jcw17] on quantum spaces with $\frak{su}(2)$ noncommutativity, hereafter denoted generically by $\mathbb{R}^3_\theta$ (see below). It appears that these latter can be modelled conveniently by exploiting a family of $SO(3)$-equivariant differential $^*$-representations as we will show in a while. It turns out that the use of differential representations [@polydiff-alg; @VK; @KV-15] may prove useful in the construction of star-products whenever the noncommutativity is of a Lie algebra type such as the case considered here. Consistency of the construction definitely requires that one works with $^*$-representations. Note that a similar construction can also be applied to the kappa-Minkowski spaces which are related to (the universal enveloping algebra of) a solvable Lie algebra. For constructions of star-products within kappa-Minkowski spaces, see e.g [@cosmogol4].\
The characterization of the related quantization maps defining the quantum spaces $\mathbb{R}^3_\theta$ can be achieved from a natural combination of the polar decomposition

The measurement of reactions (\[ddalfaKK\]) and (\[ddalfaf0\]) with cross sections in the sub-nb range are possible at the ANKE spectrometer. Using a cluster-jet target with Hydrogen as target material luminosities of $\sim 2.7\cdot10^{31}\ 
\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ have been achieved [@Fedorets_QNP2002]. Assuming that comparable luminosities can be reached with Deuterium, about 10–40 ($\mathrm{^4He}\, K^+ K^-$) events can be detected within one week of beam time (based on the experience of the previous $a_0^+$ beam times). The pions from reaction (\[ddalfaf0\]) have broader angular distributions and, thus, the acceptance of ANKE is about one order of magnitude smaller which is partially compensated by the larger cross section.

It is planned that within a few years ANKE will be equipped with a frozen-pellet target [@pellet] and a large-acceptance photon detector [@photon]. Since the achievable luminostities then will be roughly one order of magnitude higher, the isospin-violating process (\[dd\]) can be investigated by detecting the decay photons $\pi^0\rightarrow2\gamma$ and $\eta\rightarrow2\gamma$ in coincidence with the $\mathrm{^4He}$. The latter will be again identified and momentum reconstructed with ANKE. Based on our cross section estimate (\[csest\]) we conclude that a few weeks of beam time will be sufficient to collect several 100 events.

\[prop:largescale\] Suppose that a rational function $F$ satisfies the [*summability condition*]{} with an exponent $$\alpha~<~\fr{p}{\mmax+p}~.$$ Then for any $p$-conformal measure $\nu$ with no atoms at critical points $\nu(J\setminus \Jls )=0$.

For every $x\in J$ and every $k\in \N$, we use the inductive procedure of Section \[sec:stop\] to decompose the sequence $x,\dots, F^k(x)$ of preimages of $F^{k}(x)$ into blocks of either $211\dots113$ or $2$. The procedure is stopped at the first occurrence of type $2$ block, which might be of arbitrary length. In particular, it might be of length zero which means that a block of type $2$ does not occur and the sequence ends with type $1$.

Denote by ${\cal E}_{x}$ the set of all codes obtained for $x$. Points in $\Jls $ are precisely those for which we get infinitely many different type $2$ sequences. Hence, if $x\in J\setminus \Jls $, then $x$ is a terminal point of an infinite number of sequences $2111\dots113$ with only a finite choice of type $2$ blocks. Let $k(x)$ be the minimal number for which infinitely many sequences from ${\cal E}_{x}$ have the same type $2$ block of length $k(x)$. Denote $X_k:=\brs{x:k(x)=k}$ and observe that the sets $\{X_{k}:k=0,1,\dots\}$ form a countable partition of $J\setminus \Jls$. If $\nu$ has no atoms at critical points and $F^{k}(X)$ is measurable then $$\nu(F^kX)=0\iff \nu(X)=0\iff\nu(F^{-k}X)=0.$$ Since $F^k(X_k)\subset X_0$ and consequently $J\setminus \Jls\subset\cup_k F^{-k}(X_0)$, it is sufficient to prove that $\nu(X_0)=0$. Without loss of generality we can exclude from $X_0$ all preimages of the critical points since they are of zero $\nu$ measure. Every point $x\

Our results are consistent with work of Drugan and Nguyen [@dn18], who proved that the entropy of the Angenent torus is less than $2$, and with the work of Chopp [@c94], who numerically computed a graph of the Angenent torus cross-section using level set methods but did not provide its length. There are many directions in which to continue this work; see Section \[sec:futurework\].

Motivation: mean curvature flow
===============================

Mean curvature flow describes the evolution of a surface in an ambient manifold via the negative gradient flow of area. It describes, for example, the evolution of soap films. For the purposes of this exposition, we will restrict our attention to hypersurfaces $\Sigma\subset\mathbb R^{n+1}$. See the survey paper [@cmp15] for a more detailed treatment.

The *mean curvature* $H$ at a point $x$ on a surface $\Sigma\subset\mathbb R^{n+1}$ is the trace of the second fundamental form at $x$. Equivalently, the mean curvature is the sum of the principal curvatures of $\Sigma$ at $x$.

Note that in this convention we do not divide the sum of the principal curvatures by $n$ when computing the mean curvature, so it is more a curvature sum than a curvature mean. The sign convention for $H$ is such that the mean curvature of the sphere is positive.

A family of surfaces $\Sigma_t\subset\mathbb R^{n+1}$ is said to evolve by *mean curvature flow* if the points $x(t)\in\Sigma_t$ move with speed $H$ in the inward normal direction.

For closed surfaces, this flow will develop a singularity in finite time. For example, a round sphere of radius $r$ will shrink to a point in $\frac{r^2}{2n}$ units of time. The sphere is an example of a surface which evolves under mean curvature flow by dilations. Informally, one could call any such a surface a self-shrinker, but in the literature and in this article we fix the location of the singularity in space and time and use the term *self-shrinker* to refer to a surface that evolves under mean curvature by dilations about the origin and shrinks to a point after one unit of time.

A family of surfaces $\Sigma_t\subset\mathbb R^{n

The resulting set of coupled equations can be solved numerically with a finite element method [@Diddens2017b; @diddens2017evaporating; @Tan2017a]. We restrict ourselves to axial symmetry. Since the evolution of the contact angle is determined by microscopic interactions at the contact line, it cannot be predicted by the model. Instead, the experimentally measured evolution of the contact angle was imposed throughout the simulation, see Fig. \[fig:parameters\_10\]A.

In Fig. \[fig:10per\], these snapshots of the simulation for the droplet consisting of an initial $10 \%$ 1,2-hexanediol are depicted. While initially a considerable Marangoni flow is present and the profile of the evaporation rate resembles the case of a pure water droplet, the situation drastically changes at later times: The Marangoni flow ceases due to the nearly constant surface tension at lower water concentrations. Towards the end of the evaporation process, the evaporation rate suddenly decreases once the water concentration $Y_{\text{w}}$ falls below a threshold of about $10 \%$. Since this transition sets in near the contact line, the profile of the evaporation rate shows a remarkable deviation from the case of a

As with the planetary atmospheres of solar system planets, clouds are expected to play major roles in the vertical structure, chemistry, and reflected and emitted spectra of extrasolar planets. That said, the most extensive experience to date with clouds outside of the solar system has been with the brown dwarfs. The presence of refractory clouds in L dwarfs and sulphide and salt clouds in late T dwarfs has been well established and a number of methods have been developed to model these clouds.

Compared to cloud modeling approaches within the solar system or particularly on Earth, exoplanet cloud models are still in their infancy. In many cases arbitrary clouds are employed that specify a range of plausible cloud properties that are usually sufficient to explore parameter space. More sophisticated efforts attempt to derive particle sizes, composition, and number density as a function of height through the atmosphere from a given set of assumptions will be needed once higher resolution, broad wavelength spectral data become available.

As of the time of this chapter’s writing the best evidence for clouds in extrasolar planet atmospheres lies in the spectra of the planets orbiting the nearby A star HR 8799. Planets b, c, and d each have red near-infrared colors that are best explained by global refractory cloud decks that have persisted to lower effective temperatures than in higher mass field brown dwarfs. This persistence of clouds to lower effective temperatures for lower gravity objects continues a trend that has already been recognized among brown dwarfs.

Among the transiting planets there is convincing evidence for high altitude clouds--or perhaps a photochemical haze--in the atmosphere of HD 189733b. The transit spectra of this planet lacks the deep absorption bands expected for a clear atmosphere of absorbing gas but rather exhibits a smoothly varying absorption profile likely caused by small grain scattering. A second planet, GJ 1214b also has a transit spectrum lacking absorption features. In this case the spectrum may be attributable either to a small atmospheric scale height resulting from a high mean molecular weight composition or from clouds.

These early detections are like distant clouds seen at sunset presaging a coming storm. The GPI, SPHERE, and many other direct imaging planet searches are expected to discover dozens of young, self-luminous extrasolar giant planets over the coming decade (*Oppenheimer & Hinkley*, 2009; *Traub & Oppenheimer,* 2010). Many of these planets will exist in the effective temperature range in which clouds shape their emergent spectra. Meanwhile continued studies of transiting planets, particularly by the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope

Additionally, we may wish for the defect theory to preserve a certain symmetry of the bulk. Let $(\sigma^0, \sigma^1)$ be worldsheet coordinates in which $D$ is described locally as the set of points with $\sigma^1 = 0$. In these coordinates, we say that a gluing condition classically preserves a symmetry of the bulk if and only if the 1- component of the associated Noëther current glues continuously across $D$, thereby ensuring the existence of a conserved Noëther charge in the composite theory. (The quantum theory may develop an anomaly, but we will confine our discussion to the classical problem.) This being satisfied, the symmetry variation will automatically be among the allowed variations.

For instance, conservation of the worldsheet energy $H$ requires that the off-diagonal components of the stress-energy tensors glue continuously: $$T^{\, 1}_{\;\;\; 0} - {\widehat T}^{\,1}_{\;\;\; 0} = 0$$ at points of $D$. Defects satisfying this condition are said to be *conformal defects* [@Bachas:2001vj].

If, in addition, the defect gluing condition ensures that the diagonal components of the stress-energy tensor glue continuously: $$T^{\, 1}_{\;\;\; 1} - {\widehat T}^{\,1}_{\;\;\; 1} = 0$$ then worldsheet momentum $P$ is also a conserved charge. Defects satisfying this condition are called *topological defects* [@Fuchs:2007tx], due to the fact that the location of $D$ on the worldsheet can be deformed smoothly without affecting the values of correlators (so long as it does not cross through the location of a local operator insertion).

In subsequent sections, we will write down an action, vary the action, and then systematically analyze what gluing conditions set $(\delta S)_D$ minimally and ensure continuous gluing across $D$ of the 1-components of relevant Noëther currents.

Topological defects of the bosonic sigma model {#sec:bosonic}
==============================================

To begin, we analyze topological defects of the bosonic sigma model.

Let us fix notation. As above, let $(\sigma^0, \sigma^1)$ be worldsheet coordinates in which the defect line $D$ is given locally by $\sigma^1 = 0$, and the worldsheet metric is taken to be flat, with signature (-, +). Let $\

Suppose $0 \le i < k < \ell < j \le n.$ Then since $\text{Hom}_{\Bbbk Q_\epsilon}(X^\epsilon_{k,\ell}, X^\epsilon_{i,j}) = 0, \text{Ext}^1_{\Bbbk Q_\epsilon}(X^\epsilon_{k,\ell}, X^\epsilon_{i,j}) = 0$, we have by Lemma \[nested\] $ii)$ and $iv)$ that either $\epsilon_k =\epsilon_\ell = +$ or $\epsilon_k = \epsilon_\ell = -$. However, as $\operatorname{\mathrm{Hom}}_{\Bbbk Q_\epsilon}(X^\epsilon_{i,j},X^\epsilon_{k,\ell}) \neq 0$ or $\operatorname{\mathrm{Ext}}^1_{\Bbbk Q_\epsilon}(X^\epsilon_{i,j},X^\epsilon_{k,\ell}) \neq 0$, Lemma \[nested\] $i)$ and $iii)$ we have that $\epsilon_k = -$ and $\epsilon_\ell = +$ or $\epsilon_k = +$ and $\epsilon_\ell = -.$ This is a contradiction. Thus, $i,j,k,\ell$ do not satisfy $0 \le i < k < \ell < j \le n,$ and by an analogous argument, they also do not satisfy $0 \le k < i < j < \ell \le n.$

We conclude that $\Phi_{\epsilon}(U)$ and $\Phi_{\epsilon}(V)$ share an endpoint. Thus we have that one of the following holds where we forget the previous roles played by $i,j,k$:

$\begin{array}{rll}
a) & X^\epsilon_{k,j}= U \text{ and } X^\epsilon_{i,k}= V \text{ for some } 0 \le i < k < j \le n,\\

c) & X^\epsilon_{i,j}= U \text{ and } X^\epsilon_{i,k} = V \text{ for some } 0 \le i < j \le n \text{ and } 0 \le i < k \le n,\\

We found no counterparts to Ch1 within $9''$ from its position in the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS; Cutri et al. 2003) or Digital Sky Survey (DSS2)[^4] catalogs up to the limiting magnitudes $K_s=15.4$, $H=16$, $J=17.5$, $R=19$, and $B=21$. However, since the interstellar extinction towards the inner Galactic buldge is very large ($A_{V}\simeq18$ in the direction of Ch1 \[$l=8\fdg 429$, $b=-0\fdg018$\]; Schultheis et al. 1999), the limits are not very restrictive. We also examined the publically available data from the [*Spitzer*]{} GLIMPSE-II survey[^5] covering the vicinity of HESS J1804 (see the 8 $\mu$m IRAC image in Fig. 7, [*top*]{}) but found no IR sources within $10''$ from the Ch1 position, down to limiting fluxes of 5 and 6 $\mu$Jy at 4.5 and 8 $~\mu$m, respectively.

The closest match to Ch1 in radio catalogs was found in the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) catalog (Condon et al. 1998). The catalog position of the relatively faint ($27.6\pm3.8$ mJy) radio source, NVSS J180434–214025, is offset by $32''$ from the Ch1 position, less than the NVSS beam size ($45''$ FWHM). However, the apparently extended NVSS source (linear size $\sim 1\farcm5$) looks like a part of a larger ($\sim4'$ in diameter) diffuse structure, barely discernible in the NVSS image. Since the image of NVSS J180434$-$214025 shows some artificial structures, we cannot consider it as a true radio counterpart of Ch1 until it is confirmed by deeper observations.

The optical/NIR source nearest to Ch2 is located $\sim28''$ away from the best-fit X-ray centroid (see Fig. 7). Having the magnitudes $B=14.54$, $V=13.30$, $R=12.19$, $J=8.64$, $H=8.05$, and $K=7.67$, and

The comparison of the AMR observed in the disk with simple chemical evolution models suggests that the LMC is most likely losing some of its gas. This is in agreement with the work by @nidever07 which suggests that the main contribution to the Magellanic Stream comes from the LMC instead of from the SMC as it was believed until now [e.g. @putman03]. Alternatively, the LMC could be an almost closed-box system with small gas exchanges ($\alpha$=0.2, $\lambda$=0.05). This could be in agreement with the models by @bekki07 which suggest that the LMC has received metal-poor gas from the SMC in the last 2 Gyr. In our field we observed some stars with a low metallicity to which we assign an age younger than 2 Gyr. However, the uncertainty in the age determination is large.

We have also obtained the AMR of the LMC bar from the data by @c05. The bar AMR differs from the one of the disk in the last 5 Gyr: while in the disk the metallicity has increased in this time, in the bar it has remained approximately constant. This feature is best reproduced by models combination of outflow and a relatively large infall of pristine gas. Models with a smaller yield, but with an infall of previously enriched gas also reproduce the observed bar AMR. This would be in agreement with the prediction that a typical bar instability pushes the gas of the disk towards the center [@sellwood93], so the infall gas is expected to be previously pre-enrichment by the disk chemical evolution. This would be also the case in the scenario suggested by @bekki05, in which the bar would have formed from disk material as a consequence of tidal interactions between the LMC, the SMC and the Milky Way about 5 Gyr ago, the moment when the bar AMR differs from that of the disk. Also, a bar is expected to destroy any metallicity gradient within a certain radius, as it is observed.

@gshpz04 derived the LMC surface brightness profile using deep resolved star photometry of the four fields in the current spectroscopic study, and found that it remains exponential to a radius of 8 ($\simeq$ 7 kpc), with no evidence of disk truncation. Combining this information with that on the deep CMD of the outermost field, which contains a large fraction of intermediate-age stars, they concluded that the LMC disk extends (and dominates over a possible halo)

We now propose a theoretical dive by using the structure observed in the digitised dive as a guideline. In the idealised dive the athlete takes off with shape ${\boldsymbol{\alpha}}_\mathit{max}$ and immediately transitions into pike position specified by shape ${\boldsymbol{\alpha}}_\mathit{min}$. The athlete maintains pike without oscillations, then reverts back into the original shape ${\boldsymbol{\alpha}}_\mathit{max}$ to complete the dive. It appears obvious that this process will yield the maximal amount of somersault. However, as we will show, this is only true when the transition from ${\boldsymbol{\alpha}}_\mathit{max}$ to ${\boldsymbol{\alpha}}_\mathit{min}$ is instantaneous, which is of course unrealistic. When a maximum speed of shape change is imposed we will show that the amount of somersault can be increased slightly by using a different manoeuvre. The explanation behind this surprising observation is the geometric phase. We cap $|\dot{\alpha}_2| = 11.0194$ (arms) and $|\dot{\alpha}_4| = 11.1230$ (legs) when the limbs move at maximum speed, so that the transition from ${\boldsymbol{\alpha}}_\mathit{max}$ to ${\boldsymbol{\alpha}}_\mathit{min}$ (and vice versa) takes precisely a quarter second. Moving the limbs at maximum speed into and out of pike position maximises the time spent in pike, but there is no contribution to the amount of somersault from the geometric phase. We know the geometric phase is zero because there is no area enclosed by the loop $C$, as illustrated in Figure \[fig:fastest\]. The loop $C$ appears to be a line (and hence has no enclosed area) because the motions into pike and back into the layout position are happening in exactly the same way. The essential idea is to break this symmetry by making the shape change into pike and the shape change back into the layout position different.

![Here $\{s_\mathit{in}, s_\mathit{out}\}=\{0.9818, 0.3158\}$, so the transition from ${\boldsymbol{\alpha}}_f= (-0.3867, -3.0910)$ to ${\boldsymbol{\alpha}}_\mathit{min}$ takes $0.0046$ seconds, and from ${\boldsymbol{\alpha}}_\mathit{min}$ to ${\boldsymbol{\alpha}}_b=(-2.2717, -\pi)$ takes $0.1711$ seconds.

Significance
------------

The significance of each deviation in the H1 $\Sigma \pt$ and invariant mass comparison is evaluated using pseudo-data. The method determines the probability, $\hat{\rm P}$, to observe a region with a p-value less than the smallest p-value seen in data. Calculating this $\hat{\rm P}$ allows for the comparison of deviations across different final state categories. Fig. \[fig:H1\_phat\_a\] shows the $-\log_{10} \hat{\rm P}$ distribution for the invariant mass comparison using $e^-p$ data, while Fig. \[fig:H1\_phat\_b\] shows the $-\log_{10} \hat{\rm P}$ distribution for the $\Sigma \pt$ comparison using $e^+p$ data. Note that a $5\sigma$ discrepancy would correspond to a value of $-\log_{10} \hat{\rm P}$ between $5$ and $6$. No such significant discrepancies between data and SM expectations are observed. The largest deviation is in the $\mu j \nu$ final state category.

\

CONCLUSIONS
===========

The CDF and H1 general searches for new physics have probed large datasets for indications of new physics in population and kinematic distributions, using a large number of final states. These searches provide broad views of the high-$\pt$ data samples and demonstrate understanding of the detectors and SM simulation. They do not rule out all sources of new physics, thus leaving open the possibility for future discoveries.

The processing of extra background data as described above might turn out to become unpractical, due to e.g. data volume. In such a case one might consider using the remaining data of the off source locations of the actual time windows. Such a method we call “off source on time”.\
The performance of the “off source on time” method obviously depends on various detector conditions, which may limit the feasibility of such a background determination. To overcome these possible limitations, one could also envisage using the actual observed time profile and randomise the entries in time. By performing several randomisations, a representation of the corresponding background is obtained. This method we call “time shuffling”. It should be noted, however, that in the case of a large signal contribution the time shuffling method will underestimate the significance of the signal.

In view of the above, we will use the “on source off time” method in our toy model studies by generating 25 different background samples and performing our analysis procedure for each of them.\
In the case of the situation reflected by Fig. \[fig:tott1\] this yields $\bar{\psi}_{bkg}=692.04$ dB and $s_{bkg}=21.19$ dB, which is seen to be in excellent agreement with the actual background value corresponding to Fig. \[fig:bkgt1\].\
Comparison of the actually observed $\psi$ value of 713.38 dB with the reconstructed background values immediately shows that no significant signal is observed.\
However, evaluation of the data corresponding to Fig. \[fig:tott2\] yields $\psi=218.78$ dB with background values $\bar{\psi}_{bkg}=99.62$ dB and $s_{bkg}=23.98$ dB. Here a statistically significant signal is obtained.

For a uniform background and large statistics, the Bayesian $\psi$ observable can be approximated by the frequentist $\chi^{2}$ statistic, as indicated in eqs. -. This implies that the statistical significance for deviation from a uniform background distribution can be expressed in terms of a standard deviation $\sigma$ by comparison of the actually observed $\psi$ value of the stacked time profile with the corresponding $\bar{\psi}_{bkg}$ and $s_{bkg}$ background values. This is illustrated in Fig. \[fig:psidist\] for a sample of 250 different background samples according to the situation reflected in Fig.

Firstly, in Fig. \[fig:weights\], the curves of two dynamic weights corresponding to two representative facial attributes (i.e., “MouthOpen” and “Young”) during the training stage are given. We can observe that the changes of the dynamic weights corresponding to the two attributes are unstable. This is mainly because the proposed weighting scheme dynamically assigns the weight to each attribute according to the rate of the attribute loss changes (see Eq. (4)). In other words, when the loss of an attribute significantly drops, a large weight will be assigned to this attribute (since the learning process of this attribute does not converge). Therefore, the dynamic weights reflect the learning rates of different attributes, which may significantly vary. However, note that the losses of these two attributes keep decreasing and converge stably (see Fig. 5).

Secondly, in Fig. \[fig:adaptivethresholding\], the curves of adaptive thresholds corresponding to the ten randomly-chosen facial attributes during the training stage are given. We can observe that the changes of thresholds are stable. This is mainly due to the fact that the difference between the number of false positive and that of false negative is used to adjust the threshold. As the iteration goes, the difference becomes more stable.

Comparison with State-of-the-art FAC Methods
--------------------------------------------

In this subsection, we compare the performance of the proposed DMM-CNN method with several state-of-the-art FAC methods, including (1) PANDA [@b11], which uses part-based models to extract features and SVMs as classifiers; (2) LNets+ANet [@b27], which cascades two localization networks and one attribute network, and uses one SVM classifier for each attribute; (3) MOON [@b19], a novel mixed objective optimization network which addresses the multi-label imbalance problem; (4) NSA (with the median rule) [@b14], which uses segment-based methods for FAC; (5) MCNN-AUX [@b20], which divides 40 attributes into nine groups according to attribute locations; (6) MCFA [@b18], our previous work which exploits the inherent dependencies between FAC and auxiliary tasks (face detection and FLD). Note that the accuracy obtained by MOON is not given on the LFWA dataset, since MOON does not report the results on LFWA. (7) GNAS [@Huang

If a knot $K$ in thin position countains a thin level, then it is not mp-small. \[1\]

Thus, for an mp-small knot $K$, thin position must equal bridge position. In [@rs] (Theorem 4.1), a converse of Theorem \[1\] is given in the case that $K$ is the connect sum of two non-trivial knots.

Let $K$ be a connected sum of non-trivial knots, $K = K_1 \# K_2$. Then any thin position for $K$ is not bridge position for K. \[3\]

The following was also shown in [@rs]:

Let $K= \#_{i=1}^n K_i$ be a connected sum of mp-small knots. If K is in thin position, then there is an ordering of the summands $K_{i_1},
K_{i_2},\ldots ,K_{i_n}$ and a collection of leveled decomposing annuli $A_{i_1}, A_{i_2},\ldots ,A_{i_n-1}$ so that the thin levels of the presentation are precisely the annuli $\{ A_{i_j} \}$ occurring in order, where the annulus $A_{i_j}$ separates the connected sum $K_{i_1} \# K_{i_2} \#\ldots \# K_{i_j}$ from the connected sum $K_{i_j+1}
\#\ldots \# K_{i_n}$. \[rs2\]

Scharlemann–Schultens [@ss] describe a method for reimbedding a knot $K$ so that a height function on $K$ would be preserved.

Suppose $p: S^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the standard height function. Let $K \subset S^3$ be a knot that lies inside a standard unknotted torus $H \subset S^3$. Let $f: H \rightarrow S^3$ be a possibly knotted embedding of $H$ in $S^3$. Then there is a reimbedding $f^{\prime}: H \rightarrow S^3$ so that

1.  $pf^{\prime} = pf$, i.e. the reimbedding preserves height

2.  $S^3 - f^{\prime}(H)$ is a solid

The next theorem, which is the main result of this subsection, implies that no analogue of Theorem 2 can hold true if the Frobenius norm there is replaced by the nuclear norm, and it also shows that Theorem 3 cannot hold true if $R^+(k)$ is replaced by $R(k)$, that is, if the ‘quantum state constraint’ is relaxed. More precisely, we show that if a confidence set $C_n$ is required to have coverage over the maximal model $R(k_1)$, then the worst case expected nuclear norm diameter of $C_n$ over arbitrary sub-models $R(k_0), k_0=o(k_1),$ depends on the maximal model dimension $k_1$ and does not improve as $k_0 \downarrow 1$. The proof of Theorem \[main\] is based on Part 2) of Theorem \[signalthm\] and lower bound techniques for adaptive confidence sets from [@HN11; @BN13].

\[main\] Let $k_1 \to \infty$ such that $k_1=o(d)$ as $\min(n,d)\to \infty$. Suppose that for any $0<\alpha<1/3$ the confidence set $C_n=C_n(Y, \mathcal X, \alpha)$ is asymptotically honest over the maximal model $R(k_1)$, that is, it satisfies $$\label{cov2}
\liminf_{\min (n,d) \to \infty} \inf_{\theta \in R(k_1)}\mathbb P_\theta (\theta \in C_n) \ge 1-\alpha.$$ Then for every $k_0 =o(k_1)$ and some constant $c>0$ depending on $\alpha$, we have $$\label{adap}
\sup_{\theta \in R(k_0)} \mathbb E_\theta |C_n|_* \ge c \sqrt{\frac{k_1 d}{n}}$$ for every $\min(n,d)$ large enough. In particular no confidence set exists that is honest over all of $\mathbb M_d$ and that adapts in nuclear norm to any model $R(k_0), k_0 =o(\sqrt d)$.

For notational simplicity we have lower bounded the *expected diameter* $|C_n|_*$ in (\[adap\]), but the proof actually contains a stronger ‘in probability

Among all the aforementioned PSGs design, shift-register-based PSG (SR-PSG) has a better performance in terms of both the timing and hardware complexity. For length $n$ polar code decoder, it consists of $n$ registers and some other simple combination logic. Along with the estimation of each $\hat{u}_i$, the registers perform shift calculation and the partial sums can be obtained from their corresponding register. Its architecture is illustrated in Fig. \[SR\_PSG\]. This architecture is built according to the following rule: $$\label{SR_PSG_e}
  \left
  \{
   \begin{array}{l}
   R_0~\Leftarrow~\hat{u}_i\cdot c_{i,0} \\
   R_k~\Leftarrow~R_{k-1}\oplus (\hat{u}_i\cdot c_{i,k})  ,~if~k \geqslant 0 \\
   \end{array}
  \right.$$ where $\cdot$ and $\oplus$ stand for $and$ and $exclusive$-$or$ operation, respectively. In Fig. \[SR\_PSG\], $R_k$ means the $k$th register, $\hat{u}_i$ means the $i$th estimated bit. $\beta_{i,j}$ means the $j$th partial sum in stage $i$. $c_{i,k}$ means the $i$th row and $k$th column in the generate matrix $G$. The matrix generation unit is able to generate $c_{i,k}$ with very simple logic. The SC decoder consists of many basic computation parts called processing unit (PU). Each partial sum needs to be feed into the corresponding PU. The shift register based architecture can guarantee that all partial sum required by a PU are all generated in the same register, which can avoid any extra routing logic in the circuit.

Such architecture is able to receive the estimated bit and update the corresponding partial sum by every valid cycle, which is highly consistent with SC decoding processing. However, this architecture is not suitable for constituent codes based SC decoder since some partial sums are obtained directly instead of calculating from estimated bits. Thus, a PSG for constituent codes based SC decoder should have the capability to generate the new partial sums from either the directly got intermediate partial sums or the estimated bits, and to maintain the coherence of them.

Despite these successes, coupled cluster is not without its drawbacks. Coupled cluster is systematically improvable, at least in principle, by increasing the excitation level included in the CC wavefunction ansatz. Doing so makes the conventional CC equations vastly more complicated and hence computational demanding. As a result, treating higher truncation levels is possibly only in specialist codes[@MRCC]. Conventional implementations of coupled cluster also rely heavily upon dense linear algebra, which does not scale well with increasing numbers of processors on parallel or heterogeneous computer architectures, though recent work in linear algebra and tensor libraries are making impressive progress[@Agullo2009; @Solomonik2014].

One avenue for improving the computational efficiency of coupled cluster is to exploit the nearsighted nature of electron correlation and use local approximations[@FlockeBartlett_04JCP; @Ziokowski2010; @RiplingerNeese_13JCP; @RiplingerNeese_13JCP2]. Another approach, of increasing use in quantum chemistry and the broader electronic structure community, is to use stochastic methods; these have proven to provide low-scaling algorithms for electronic structure methods and typically exhibit excellent scaling with increasing processor count[@Foulkes2001; @Thom2007; @Willow2012; @Willow2013; @Baer2013]. Local and stochastic methods may also be easily combined via a localisation transformation of the mean-field single-particle orbitals.[^1].

The full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) method[@BoothAlavi_09JCP; @ClelandAlavi_12JCTC] has been a major development in quantum chemistry. By sampling the action of the Hamiltonian, FCIQMC has been able to calculate exact properties for quantum systems inaccessible to conventional diagonalisation techniques[@BoothAlavi_09JCP; @ShepherdAlavi_12PRB; @Overy2014; @Blunt2015; @Blunt2017]. The computational advantage of FCIQMC is largely through a representation of the FCI wavefunction which is significantly more compact than the full wavefunction, though still scaling factorially with the size of the Hilbert space sampled.

One of us (AJWT) subsequently used a similar approach to formulate a Monte Carlo approach to coupled cluster theory (CCMC)[@Thom_10PRL], inheriting the benefits of more compact storage, and now scaling with the polynomial size of the truncated CC space. The initiator approximation can substantially improve the stochastic sampling of the

To see that $I^2 \neq I$ for $I$ proper, we can use the following.

If $P$ is a commutative unital ring with no zero divisors and $I$ is a proper ideal which is finitely generated, then $I^2
\neq I$.

[[*Proof.* ]{}]{}Assume that $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ are generators of $I$ and $I^2 = I$. Then $x_i = \sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}x_j$ for some $a_{ij}
\in I$, so that $\sum_{j=1}^n b_{ij}x_j = 0$ where $b_{ij} =
\delta_{ij} -a_{ij}$. Setting $B = \left(b_{ij}\right)$, Cramer’s Rule gives $x_i \det B = 0$ whence $\det B = 0$. But $\det B \in \{1\} + I$ so $\det B \neq 0$. $\blacktriangledown$

Thus ${P({{\mathcal O}})}$ is not essentially simple.

The last part of this proof provides a converse to Proposition \[es\] when $P = {P({{\mathcal O}})}$. In particular, we conclude that ${P({{\mathcal O}})}$ is simple if and only if ${{\mathcal O}}$ is semisimple.

One can also see explicitly that ${P({{\mathcal O}})}$ is not essentially simple when ${{\mathcal O}}$ is nilpotent as follows. Since a nilpotent orbit is conical [@Br], $I({{\mathcal O}})$ is a homogeneous ideal. As a consequence, the notion of homogeneous polynomial makes sense in $P({{\mathcal O}})$. Let $P_k({{\mathcal O}})$ denote the subspace consisting of all homogeneous polynomials of degree $k$. By virtue of the commutation relations of ${{\mathfrak g}}$, $$\{P_k({{\mathcal O}}),P_l({{\mathcal O}})\} \subset
P_{k+l-1}({{\mathcal O}}),$$ whence each $P_{(k)}({{\mathcal O}}) = \oplus_{\ell \geq k}P_\ell({{\mathcal O}})$ for $k \geq 1$ is a proper Poisson ideal of ${P({{\mathcal O}})}$.

Computation of the correlation and response spectra from data
-------------------------------------------------------------

To determine the velocity correlation spectrum, we do the following: (a) sample the unperturbed trajectory $x(t)$ at a temporal resolution $\delta t$ for a duration $T_{sp}$ ($\gg \tau_s$); (b) compute the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) $\tilde{x}(\omega)$ of $x(t)$, from which the velocity correlation spectrum $\omega^2|\tilde{x}(\omega)|^2 $ is constructed; (c) following the proposal in [@berg2004power], perform local average of the spectrum to suppress noise (known as data compression).

To determine the velocity response spectrum at selected frequencies $\{\omega_k\}$ simultaneously, we do the following: (a) sample the trajectory $x(t)$ perturbed by a linear combination of periodic driving forces $h=\sum_k h_k\exp(i\omega_k t)$, at a temporal resolution $\delta t$ for a duration $T_{sp}$ ($\gg \tau_s$); (b) compute the DFT $\tilde{x}(\omega)$ of the perturbed trajectory $x(t)$; (c) at each $\omega_k$, calculate the response $\tilde{R}_x(\omega_k)=\tilde{x}(\omega_k)/h_k$, and thus the velocity response $\tilde{R}_{\dot{x}}(\omega_k)=-i\omega_k \tilde{R}_x(\omega_k)$.

Below we examine in some detail fluctuations of the spectra constructed through the above procedure when a single long trajectory is used in computation. This will allow us to devise suitable averaging procedures to suppress noise in the data without significantly hampering its information content.

### Correlation spectrum

The discussion below follows main ideas of the power spectrum analysis presented in Ref. [@berg2004power].

For a general stochastic trajectory $x(t)$ sampled at resolution $\delta t$ and for duration $T_{sp}=N_{sp}\delta t$, we introduce the following DFT, $$\tilde{x}(\omega_k)=\frac{\sqrt{\delta t}}{\sqrt{N_{sp}}}\sum_{j=1}^{N_{sp}} x(j\delta t)\exp(-i\omega_k j \delta t) ,
\label{eq:renormalization}$$ where $\omega_k=2\

We have studied collective excitations of interacting bosons in a lattice at zero temperature within the framework of the [*gapless*]{} and [*conserving*]{} time-dependent Gutzwiller approximation. The excitation modes are calculated within the framework of the linear-response theory considering small perturbation of the many-body ground state. We demonstrated that the lowest-energy excitation of the SF has a phonon-like dispersion relation and derived an analytical expression for the sound velocity in terms of compressibility and the condensate density which coincides with the hydrodynamic relation.

We have studied the response of the lattice Bose gas in the Bragg scattering process which provides an experimental tool to observe the excitations. It is demonstrated that the susceptibility function satisfies the f-sum rule in the whole parameter region. Calculations of the transition amplitudes show that within the Gutzwiller approximation the MI does not respond to the perturbation caused by the Bragg potential. In the SF phase, we show that only three lowest excitation branches have significant transition amplitudes, the others being too small to be observed in a real experiment. The absence of response in the MI phase is a limitation of the Gutzwiller approximation and can be corrected in the next leading order in the inverse of the coordination number which would take into account the possibility of a particle-hole pair creation [@Navez; @Huber].

Finally, we have performed simulations of the sound-wave propagation solving numerically the Gutzwiller equations. The calculations show that sound waves can be created only in the SF phase and the corresponding velocity is in a good agreement with the results of the linear-response theory.

\[Der\]Derivation of Eq. (\[c\_s\])
===================================

In order to work out the sound velocity $c_s^0$, we consider the limit of small $|{\mathbf{k}}|$ and look for the lowest energy solution of Eq. (\[evpexc\]) as an expansion with respect to ${\mathbf{k}}$: $$\begin{aligned}

As can be seen in Fig. \[fig\_HK\_cpv\] (left panel), HK has the potential to exclude CP conservation ($\delta_{CP} = 0$) for the normal mass ordering, with a significance larger than $5\sigma$ after 10 years of data-taking. With enough time, HK will also reach a large sensitivity for the determination of the correct neutrino mass ordering (depending on the value of $\delta_{CP}$ (right panel of Fig. \[fig\_HK\_cpv\]).

However, HK has a rich scientific program which goes beyond the study od neutrino oscillations, including the search of nucleon decays, neutrinos emitted by supernova and from other astrophysical sources (dark matter annihilation, gamma ray burst jets, and pulsar winds) [@Abe:2018uyc].

Comparison of series (\[dec1b\]) and (\[dec1c\]), that the factors at addenda of these series differ, especially second and third term of a series. Just, these addenda also give corrections to the effective theory of heavy quarks. If we let’s assume, that the parameter $\Lambda _{QCD}=a\beta $ with $a=\sqrt{2}$, the first terms of series practically coincides for two variants $$f_{nonrel}\approx \sqrt{N_c}\beta \sqrt{W}(0.60-0.47 W^2+0.55 W^4),
\label{de1ca}$$ but the second and third terms nevertheless essentially differ. Practically we compare two approaches of an evaluation of relativistic corrections for the effective theory of heavy quarks: the first approach follows from an exact solution of a problem with a consequent passage to the limit of heavy quarks; the second approach is based on an approximate solution of a problem; In the second approach, and such approach, as we see requires cutting relative momentum by magnitude $\Lambda _{QCD}$ in a quark model of a meson, relativistic corrections has the smaller value just because of cutting. Such divergence can be reduced by introduction of a parameter $\mu $ , which $\gg \Lambda _{QCD}$. However, it can be defined a value only using exact calculation. Therefore use of exact expressions for observable magnitudies is represented preferable to us, as, the numerical integration both approximate relations, and exact expressions has an identical order of complexity.

Consider then a general action of real fields $\phi_i(x)$ (which could be the components of a field with arbitrary spin properties) in arbitrary dimensions: $${\mathcal{S}}= \int {\mathrm{d}}^nx \; {\mathcal{L}}\left[x^\mu, \phi_i(x), \partial_\mu \phi_i(x)\right] \:.

Introduction
============

Medical imaging is the field in which radiation is used for imaging the body of the diseased patient. For this purpose, many such systems has been developed to serve the man kind. X-Ray radiography, Computed Tomography (CT), Ultrasonography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Nuclear Medicine Imaging and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) are some techniques generally used in medical imaging. Out of these, PET is widely used for the staging, restaging, drug and therapy response of the patients diagnosed with cancer.

PET enables us to get morphological/functional imaging of bio-distribution of positron emitting radionuclide or radiopharmaceutical introduced purposely within the body of the patient/animal. Current PET detection technique involves co-incidence detection technique to correlate the two annihilation photons emitted in the almost exactly opposite direction detected by a ring type scintillation-based detection system \[1\].

PET involves a technique to get information of position of annihilation event of positronium decaying to number of photons (can decay to more than 2 photon). Position information of the events helps in constrcuting an image of the distribution of positron emitting radionuclide in the body of patient\[1\].

To reconstruct the raw data in an informative PET image, one needs to investigate exactly the true events (paired photons) from the random, scattred and multiple events \[2\].

False coincidences introduce noise and contrast lost in the reconstructed image and also enhance the chances to misinterpretation. PET systems involve the two windows for the selection of true events which are enegy window and timing window. At present, time and energy windowing, which are applied over the primary coincidence data, discard all multiple events, as well as a considerable fraction of unscattered coincidence events due to the relatively poor energy resolution of current detectors \[2\].

Besides these parameters for the selection of true coincidence, there is an other parameter which, possiblly can accuratly measure the true coincidence. And that parameters enables us to introduced another selection window (which we are calling as the 3rd EYE) based on quantum entanglement of the two annihilation photons emitted by para-positronium.

    Observe that we have two independent groups of black vertices and two independent groups of white vertices (of course the colors are interchangeable), and in the ordering induced by the diagonal all vertices of one color are followed by all vertices of the other. Then in the ordering there is first the three vertices of the first black group $B_1$, then the other black group $B_2$, then a white group $W_1$ and then the other white group $W_2$. Note that by symetry the situation is fully equivalent to exchanging the role of $B_1$ and $B_2$, and/or that of $W_1$ and $W_2$ in the ordering. If follows that there exists $i\in B_1$, $j \in B_2$, $k \in W_1,$ $l \in W_2$, such that $(i,k)\in E,$ $(j,l)\in E$ and $(k,l)\notin E$. (See for example the diamonds on Figure \[fig:L=4\_groups\].) Then the graph is not diagonal because the crossing condition is violated, and therefore we obtain a contradiction.

In principle, the form of this dependence can be predicted in a low-energy effective field theory combining heavy-baryon chiral perturbation theory for the proton [@Jenkins:1991ne; @Jenkins:1990jv] with heavy-hadron chiral perturbation theory [@Yan:1992gz; @Cho:1992cf] for the $\Lambda_Q$. However, there are a number of issues that limit the usefulness of this approach for our work. One limitation is that chiral perturbation theory breaks down for momenta $|\mathbf{p'}|$ comparable to or larger than the chiral symmetry breaking scale. Another limitation is that the effective theory also needs to include the $\Sigma_Q$ and $\Delta$ baryons in the chiral loops, which is expected to lead to additional unknown low-energy constants associated with the matching of the $Q \to u$ current to the $\Sigma_Q \to p$, $\Lambda_Q \to \Delta$, and $\Sigma_Q \to \Delta$ currents in the effective theory. Finally, some of the data sets used here are partially quenched (with valence-quark masses lighter than the sea-quark masses), which further increases the complexity of the effective theory. As in Ref. [@Detmold:2012vy], we therefore use a simple model that successfully describes the dependence of the form factors on $E_N$, $m_{u,d}$, and $a$, at the present level of uncertainty. It is given by $$\begin{aligned}
 F_\pm^{i,n} &=& \frac{Y_\pm}{(X_\pm^i+E_N^{i,n}-m_N^i)^2}\cdot [1 + d_\pm (a^i E_N^{i,n})^2], \label{eq:dipole}\end{aligned}$$ where the position of the pole depends on the pion mass, $$X_\pm^i = X_\pm + c_\pm \cdot \left[ (m_\pi^i)^

As an initial state we consider an “odd” pure state |= |10+ e\^[i]{} |01 ($0<\beta<\pi/2$), which is relevant for experiments with the phase qubits. [@ste06] Since the parameter $\alpha$ corresponds to $z$-rotation of one of the qubits, while decoherence as well as values of $C$ and $S_+$ are insensitive to such rotation, all results of our model have either trivial or no dependence on $\alpha$. The evolution of the state (\[2.5\]) due to local decoherence ${\cal L}$ can be calculated analytically, and at time $t$ the non-vanishing elements of the two-qubit density matrix $\rho$ are && \_[11]{}(t)=(1-g\_a) h\_b g\_b \^2 + h\_ag\_a(1-g\_b)\^2 ,\
&& \_[22]{}(t)=(1-g\_a) (1-h\_b g\_b) \^2 + h\_ag\_a g\_b \^2 ,\
&& \_[33]{}(t) = g\_a h\_bg\_b \^2 +(1-h\_ag\_a)(1-g\_b)\^2,\
&& \_[44]{}(t) = g\_a (1-h\_bg\_b) \^2 +(1-h\_ag\_a) g\_b \^2 ,\
&& \_[32]{}(t)= \_[23]{}\^\*(t)= (-t/T\_2\^a-t/T\_2\^b) e\^[i]{} (2)/2 , where $g_{a,b}$ are defined below Eq. (\[5.8-m\]), and $\rho_{ij}$ subscripts $i,j=1,2,3,4$ correspond to the basis $\{|11\rangle,
|10\rangle, |01\rangle,|00\rangle\}$. These equations become very simple at zero temperature because then $h_a=h_b=0$. Notice that the dephasing times $T_2^{a,b}$ enter Eqs. only through the combination $1/T_2^a+1/T_2^b$ (this is not so for a general initial state), so that the two-qubit dephasing can be characterized by one parameter $T_2\equiv 2/(1/T_2^a+1/T_

abstract: 'Convolution operation is indispensable in studying analog optical and digital signal processing. Equally important is the correlation operation. The time domain community often teaches convolution and correlation only with one dimensional time signals. That does not clearly demonstrate the effect of convolution and correlation between two signals. Instead if we consider two dimensional spatial signals, the convolution and correlation operations can be very clearly explained. In this paper, we propose a lecture demonstration of convolution and correlation between two spatial signals using the Fourier transform tool. Both simulation and optical experiments are possible using a variety of object transparencies. The demonstration experiments help to clearly explain the similarity and the difference between convolution and correlation operations. This method of teaching using simulation and hands-on experiments can stimulate the curiosity of the students. The feedback of the students, in my class teaching, has been quite encouraging.'

title: Teaching the concept of convolution and correlation using Fourier transform
---

Motivation
==========

In the under graduate programs of electrical, electronics and communication engineering, convolution and correlation are taught in many courses, such as signals and systems, digital signal processing and communication theory. The electronics or the time domain community treat the subject of convolution and correlation mainly with respect to one-dimensional time domain signals. On the other hand, the optics and photonics community teach convolution and correlation with respect to two-dimensional spatial signals. It is observed that the subject can be better appreciated if examples from two-dimensional spatial signals are considered.

Introduction {#sec:background}
============

Convolution is a mathematical method of combining two signals to form a third signal. The characteristics of a linear system is completely specified by the impulse response of the system and the mathematics of convolution [@DSP_book_Smith]. It is well-known that the output of a linear time (or space) invariant system can be expressed as a convolution between the input signal and the system impulse response function.

Convolution is the basis for many signal processing techniques. As for example digital filters are synthesized by designing appropriate impulse response functions. Targets are detected on the radar by analyzing the measured impulse responses. In long distance telephone communication, echo suppression is achieved by creating impulse responses those cancel out the impulse responses of the reverber

1.  For each $i\in F$ there exists a subset $M_i\subseteq \mathcal{B}_{X_i}$ satisfying $$\mathcal{B}_{Z_i} = \left\{ x_i \in \mathcal{B}_{X_i} : \|x_i -m_i\|\leq 1 \hbox{ for all } m_i \in M_i \right\};$$

2.  $\|x - (a_i)_{i\in F}\|, \|y - (b_i)_{i\in F}\| <\varepsilon$ [(]{}we obviously regard $\displaystyle \bigoplus_{i\in F}^{\ell_{\infty}} Z_i$ as a closed subspace of $X$[)]{};

3.  The closed unit ball of the space $\displaystyle \bigoplus_{i\in F}^{\ell_{\infty}} Z_i$ satisfies the strong Mankiewicz property.

Then every convex body $K\subset X$ satisfies the strong Mankiewicz property.

By [@MoriOza2018 Lemma 4] it suffices to prove that the closed unit ball of $X$ satisfies the strong Mankiewicz property. To this end let $\Delta :\mathcal{B}_{X}\to L$ be a surjective isometry, where $L$ is a convex subset in a normed space $Y$. We shall show that $\Delta$ is affine.

Let us take $x,y\in \mathcal{B}_{X}$ and $t\in (0,1)$. Fix an arbitrary $\varepsilon >0.$ It follows from our hypotheses that there exist a finite set $F\subseteq I$, closed subspaces $Z_i\subseteq X_i$ and elements $a_i,b_i\in \mathcal{B}_{Z_i}$ ($i\in F$) such that the closed unit ball of the space $\displaystyle Z= \bigoplus_{i\in F}^{\ell_{\infty}} Z_i$ satisfies the strong Mankiewicz property, $\|x - (a_i)_{i\in F}\| <\varepsilon$ and $\|y - (b_i)_{i\in F}\| <\varepsilon$.

We also know the existence of subsets $M_i\subseteq \mathcal{B}_{X_i}$ ($i\in I$) satisfying $(1)$. Let $M\subseteq X$ denote the set given by $$

In addition to the interest raised by the exotic ground state of the Shastry-Sutherland model, the presence of several magnetization plateaux in SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ has attracted significant attention. Distinct 1/8, 1/4, and 1/3 plateaux have been reported early on in the magnetization process [@Kage99; @Onizuka00]. More recently, additional plateaux between 1/8 and 1/4 have been observed [@Sebastian08; @Takigawa12], and evidence in favor of the presence of the long predicted 1/2 plateau has been provided by magnetostriction measurements [@Jaime12]. However, the entire 1/2 plateau phase has not been unveiled in Ref.  because of the technical upper limit of the magnetic field at 100.75 T.

The 1/2 plateau has been predicted to be less stable than the 1/3 plateau and to disappear for large $J'/J$ [@MT00PRB]. In fact, according to Ref. , the length of the 1/2 plateau is less than half that of the 1/3 plateau, although the 1/2 plateau can be expected to be quite stable considering the checkerboard pattern of the triplet excitation suggested by the boson picture. Hence, the experimental determination of the stability range of the 1/2 plateau is of particular interest in itself, and also important for checking the validity of the theoretical model. Moreover, in addition to the 1/2 plateau, exotic high-field spin states have been predicted such as supersolid phases between the 1/3 and 1/2 plateaux and above the 1/2 plateau [@MT00PRB; @lou12]. The quantum spin state realized when the density of triplets becomes very high has not been uncovered yet.

In the present work, we have investigated the spin states of SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ by magnetization measurements in high magnetic fields up to 118 T. A clear 1/2 magnetization plateau phase has been observed in the field range from 84 to 108 T, and at the upper critical field, a sharp magnetization increase suggests a first-order phase transition.

which translates to $$\begin{aligned}

  \biggr] \ .
\label{gamm20}\end{aligned}$$ Finally, we shall require the renormalized relaxation vertex to one-loop order, $$\begin{aligned}

  \right) \biggr] \ ,
\label{gamm13}\end{aligned}$$ evaluated at equal incoming external wave vectors and frequencies ${\underline k} = (q,\omega)$.

Critical dynamics of the relaxational models
--------------------------------------------

We may now proceed with the perturbative renormalization of the purely relaxational models A and B, generalizing the methods outlined in Chap. 3 to the dynamical action (\[resfab\]). The quadratic UV divergence (near the upper critical dimension $d_c = 4$) in (\[gamm11\]) is taken care of by an appropriate [*additive renormalization*]{}; since we are concerned with near-equilibrium kinetics here, and $\chi(q,\omega = 0) = \chi(q)$, the result is precisely the $T

The theorem will follow from this Claim by descending induction on $\delta$.

We now proceed to the proof of the Claim. The case $\delta=d$ has already been discussed, so we will work under the hypothesis $d>\delta\ge d'$. Assuming by contradiction that the Claim is false we first construct an infinite descending filtration $F=F^0\supset F^1 \supset F^2 \supset F^3 \supset...$ such that $F^n_{{\mathbb{D}}^*}= F_{{\mathbb{D}}^*}$ and $F^n_0$ not $(d,\delta)$-semistable for every $n\in{\mathbb{N}}$, as follows: supposing that $F^n$ has already been constructed, let $B^n\subset F_0^n$ be the maximal $(d,\delta)$-destabilizing subsheaf of $F_0^n$, let $G^n:=F_0^n/B^n$ and let $F^{n+1}$ be the kernel of the composition $F^n\to F_0^n\to G^n$. These sheaves are related through two exact sequences $$\label{seq:1}
0\to B^n\to F_0^n\to G^n\to 0$$ $$\label{seq:2}
0\to G^n\to F_0^{n+1}\to B^n\to 0.$$ To explain the second we will tensorize over $\cO_{\mathbb{D}}$ the exact sequence $0\to F^{n+1}\to F^{n}\to G^n\to 0$ by $0\to \gm\to \cO_{\mathbb{D}}\to\cO_{\mathbb{D}}/\gm\to0$, where $\gm$ is the ideal sheaf of the origin in ${\mathbb{D}}$, to get the following commutative diagram with exact rows and columns. $$\label{diagr:snake}

Further research
----------------

It is worth to look at the way the fix in the revision is identified. Boa-provided function `isfixingrevision` is based only on the commit message text analysis. We assume this function is not ideal and integrating Boa API with outside software, such as bug tracking systems, can be a better solution to determine existing bugs in code revisions.

The data used for building prediction models in our study has big disproportions. Applying different filters and criteria (more mature projects, different languages and so on) could provide better data set for analysis, with more fixing revisions.

An interesting path of further research are process metrics [@Madeyski15SQJ; @Madeyski11], which reflect changes over time and are becoming the crucial ingredients of software defect prediction models.

Conclusions
===========

Overall, the goal of the research, as described with research questions — implementation of software metrics in Boa and collecting data sets from a large number of projects, e.g., for the sake of prediction models —has been achieved. We were able to implement some of the classic software engineering metrics using Boa, we presented some Boa-specific metrics, and we made an attempt to create a defect prediction model with the data we gathered. This proves that Boa can be a useful tool for data mining analysis in this particular field, as well as for creating sophisticated queries regarding its data sets. However, Boa is still a new framework that comes with a few disadvantages, and some of the metrics and operations were impossible to implement at the moment. In the following sections, the challenges met and our solutions are presented.

Challenges {#subsection:challenges}
----------

Boa uses visitor pattern—one of Boa’s greatest strengths—which sometimes might provide unexpected results if queries are not written properly.

### Local and nested classes

One of the first issues we encountered creating Boa queries was a different size of output jobs. For our metrics, we gathered all classes from all projects. Therefore, for the same data set, all queries should return the same number of rows. As it turned out, the difference was caused by the behaviour of the visitor pattern, used by Boa. When source code contains a local class (class defined inside one of the methods) or a nested class (

Let $M$ be a $3$-manifold. If $\pi=\pi_1(M)$ has one end then $H_2(\widetilde{M},\partial\widetilde{M};\mathbb{Z})=
H^1(M;\mathbb{Z}[\pi])=0$, by Poincaré duality. Hence $H_1(\partial\widetilde{M};\mathbb{Z})=0$. If $\partial{M}$ is a union of aspherical surfaces it follows that $H_2(\partial\widetilde{M};\mathbb{Z})=0$. Hence $H_*(\widetilde{M};\mathbb{Z})=0$ for $*>0$ and so $M$ is aspherical. If moreover $\partial{M}$ is nonempty $M$ retracts onto a finite 2-complex. The group $\Pi=\overline{H^2(M;\mathbb{Z}[\pi])}$ is free abelian since ${H^2}(M;\mathbb{Z}[\pi])\cong
{H_1}(\widetilde{M},\partial\widetilde{M};\mathbb{Z})$ is the kernel of the augmentation $H_0(\partial\widetilde{M};\mathbb{Z})\to{H_0}(\widetilde{M};\mathbb{Z})$.

Since $H^s(\pi;\mathbb{Z}[\pi])=0$ for $s\not=2$ and $H^2(\pi;\mathbb{Z}[\pi])$ is torsion-free $\pi$ is a 2-dimensional duality group [@Bi].

The class of groups covered by this lemma includes all $PD_2$-groups, classical knot groups and solvable $HNN$ extensions $Z*_m$ other than $Z$. Whether every finitely presentable group $\pi$ of cohomological dimension 2 has a finite 2-dimensional $K(\pi,1)$-complex and is semistable at infinity remain open questions.

Let $\pi=Z*_m$, $w=1$ and $\Pi=E^2\mathbb{Z}$. Then $\Pi\odot_\pi\Pi$ is torsion-free.

The group $\pi=Z*_m$ has a one-relator presentation $\langle{a,t}\mid{ta=a^mt}\rangle$ and is also a semidirect product $Z[\frac1m]\rtimes{Z}$. Let $R=\mathbb{Z}[\pi]$ and $

If $F$ is any circled domain in $\mathbb{C}^{m}$, what can be said about the Bergman kernel of $$\widehat{\Omega}_{F}=\left\{  \left(  z,Z\right)  \in\Omega\times
\mathbb{C}^{m}\mid Z\in\left(  p(z)\right)  ^{1/2}F\right\}  ,$$ for example when $\Omega$ is a bounded symmetric domain, $p=N_{\Omega
}(z,z)^{\mu}$ and $F$ another bounded symmetric domain?

For some families $\left\{  F\right\}  $ other than the family $\left\{
B_{m}\right\}  $ of Hermitian balls, is it possible to define an analogous of the virtual Bergman kernel $\mathcal{L}_{\Omega,p}$ and obtain an analogous of Theorem \[TH1\]?

It would also be interesting to replace the weighted Bergman space $H(\Omega,p)$ by more general Hilbert spaces of holomorphic functions; for example, when $\Omega$ is a bounded symmetric domain, the spaces with reproducing kernel $N(z,z)^{\mu}$, where $\mu$ is in the Berezin-Wallach set of $\Omega$ (see [@FarautKoranyi1990]).

In this extended abstract, our main goal is to develop multi class classifier. We generally use the terminology “multinomial classification or multi-class classification” when we have a classification problem for classifying observations or instances into one of three or more classes.

The main theory behind quantum inspired multi-class classification is as follows: The choice among the $N$ hypotheses, which the $k^{th}$ asserts “The system has the density operator $\rho_k$,” in which $k =1, 2, 3, ....., N$ can be based on the result of the measurement of $N$ commuting operators $P_1, P_2, ...., P_N$, making a resolution of identity operator $1$:

$$P_1+P_2+ ....+P_N = 1$$

Our problem is getting the set of projectors so that the choice among the $N$ hypothesis can be made with the minimum average cost. It will assist in the event of Quantum Detection Theory, in constructing and estimating the best receiver for the communications system. In this, messages are coded into an alphabets of 3 or more symbols, and a distinct signal is transmitted for each.

Assume $\xi_k$ is the prior probability of the hypothesis $H_k$, and $K_{ij}$ is the

In Tables \[tab:decay1\] and \[tab:decay2\] we show integrated values for $\Gamma(R\to PV\gamma)$ and also rates of $\Gamma(R\to PV\gamma)$ with respect to $\Gamma(D^*_{(s)}\to D_{(s)}\gamma)$. In the case of the decays of the resonance into $D^{*0}\bar{D}^0\gamma$, $D^{*+}_s D^-_s\gamma$, $D^{*0}\bar{D}^0\pi^0$ and $D^{*+}_s D^-_s\pi^0$, we compute $g_{PV\gamma}$ in Eq. (\[eq:radwidth\]) taking $\Gamma(D^{*0})<2.1$ MeV and $\Gamma(D^{*+}_s)<1.

From now on, we will assume that $G={\mathbb{Z}}/r_1{\mathbb{Z}}\times\dots\times{\mathbb{Z}}/r_n{\mathbb{Z}}$ such that $r_j|r_{j+1}$ and $q\equiv1 {\ (\text{mod}\ r_n)}$. Under these assumptions we can apply Kummer theory (Chap.14 Proposition 37 of [@DF]) to find $F_j\in{\mathbb{F}}_q[X]$, $r_j^{th}$-power free for $j=1,\dots,n$ such that $$K(C) = K\left(\sqrt[r_1]{F_1(X)},\dots,\sqrt[r_n]{F_n(X)}\right).$$

Let $${\mathcal{H}}^*_{G,g} = \{C\in{\mathcal{H}}_{G,g} : F_j \mbox{ is monic}\}$$ $${\mathcal{H}}^*_{G,g}(\vec{k},E) = \{C \in {\mathcal{H}}_{G,g}(\vec{k},E): F_j \mbox{ is monic}\}.$$ We call curves in ${\mathcal{H}}^*_{G,g}$ *monic*.

Now for each $F_j$, it’s leading coefficient can be chosen from any of the equivalence classes of ${\mathbb{F}}_q^*/({\mathbb{F}}_q^*)^{r_j}$ to give a different extension (and thus curve). Therefore we see that $|{\mathcal{H}}_{G,g}| = |G||{\mathcal{H}}^*_{G,g}|$ and $|{\mathcal{H}}_{G,g}(\vec{k},E)| = |G||{\mathcal{H}}_{G,g}(\vec{k},E)|$. Therefore, we will work with ${\mathcal{H}}^*_{G,g}$ and ${\mathcal{H}}^*_{G,g}(\vec{k},E)$ from now on.

Now, define $${\mathcal{R}}= [0,\dots,r_1-1]\times\dots\times[0,\dots,r_n-1]\setminus\{(0,\dots,0)\}$$ to be set of integer valued vectors denoted as $\vec{\alpha}=(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n)$ such that not all of them are

If the boundary of $K$ is suitably smooth, it is possible to define surface integrals and traces at the boundary of functions in the Sobolev spaces $W^{1,2}_{\alpha}(K, \mu)$. Then we prove that the traces of the functions in $\oo{W}^{1,2}_{\alpha} (K,\mu)$ vanish. Therefore, the Dirichlet boundary condition in is satisfied in the sense of the trace, and $T^{K}_{\alpha}(t)\varphi $ has null trace at the boundary for every $t>0$ and $\varphi\in L^2(K,\mu)$.

Surface integrals for gaussian measures in Hilbert spaces are not a straightforward extension of the finite dimensional theory. To our knowledge the best reference is [@Bo §6.10], where the Malliavin theory is presented. It deals with level surfaces of smooth functions $g$ in a more general context than ours, since Souslin spaces $X$ are considered instead of Hilbert spaces. A part of the theory may be simplified in our Hilbert setting, and moreover some of the smoothness assumptions on $g$ can be weakened. Therefore, we end the paper with an appendix describing surface measures for level surfaces of suitably regular functions $g:H\mapsto {{\mathbb R}}$.

Several related important problems remain open, even for bounded $K$ with smooth boundary. Among them:

-   While in finite dimensions $\varphi = R(\lambda, L^{K}_{\alpha})f$ is a strong solution to and it belongs to $W^{2,2}(K,\mu)$ under reasonable assumptions on the boundary $\partial K$ ([@LMP]), in infinite dimensions we do not know whether $\varphi$ possesses second order derivatives in $L^2(K,\mu)$, even if $K$ is the closed unit ball. In fact, even in the case $\alpha =1$, the estimates found in [@DPGZ; @Tal] are very bad both near the boundary and near $t=0$, and it is not clear how to use them to get informations on the resolvent.

-   We do not know whether $T^{K}_{\alpha}(t)$ is strong Feller in $K$ (i.e., it maps $B_b(K)$, the space of the bounded Borel functions in $K$, to $C_b(K)$). This problem is open even for $K = \{ x\in H:\; |x

In a recent Letter [@Nitta], Bergsten et al. have studied the resistance oscillations with gate voltage $V_g$ and magnetic field $B$ in arrays of semiconductor rings, and interpreted the oscillatory $B$-dependence as Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak oscillations and oscillatory $V_g$-dependence as the time reversal Aharonov-Casher (AC) effect. This comment shows (i) that authors [@Nitta] incorrectly identified AAS effect as a source of resistance oscillations with $B$, (ii) that spin relaxation in \[1\] is strong enough to destroy oscillatory effects of spin origin, e.g., AC effect, and (iii) the oscillations in [@Nitta] are caused by changes in carrier density and the Fermi energy by gate, and are unrelated to spin.

AAS effect is the $h/2e$ oscillations of conductance with $B$ in disordered diffusive rings. Oscillations occur because the intereference of the two electron trajectories passing the whole ring clock- and counterclockwise survives disorder averaging in conditions of diffusive regime $l \ll L_{\phi},L$, where $l$ is the mean free path, $L_{\phi}$ is the phase breaking length, and $L$ is the circumference of the ring.

The mean free path in samples [@Nitta] is $l\sim1.5{-}2\,\mu{m}$. From the ratio of h/2e and h/4e signal amplitudes [@Nitta], $L_{\phi}$ is between 2.8 and 3.5 $\mu{m}$. (Note that $h/2e$ signal is due to interference of clockwise and counterclockwise paths, with magnitude defined by $\exp(-2L/L_{\phi})$, and $h/4e$ oscillations are due to interference of paths going twice clockwise and twice counterclockwise, defined by $\exp(-4L/L_{\phi})$. The calculation of $L_{\phi}$ in [@Nitta] misses a factor of two.). Thus, samples [@Nitta] are not in diffusive regime relevant to AAS oscillations, but are in the quasi-ballistic regime $l \lesssim L$. Then $h/2e$ oscillations are defined not only by interference of time-reversed paths, but also e.g., by the interference of the amplitude of propagation through the right arm clockwise and the amplitude of propagation via the

We remark that we have assumed $X$ is a projective (but not necessarily fine-grained) observable, i.e., a PVM. To generalize to the case where $X$ is a POVM, simply replace $S$ on the right side with a Naimark extension ${\mathbf{S}}$, i.e., an enlargement of the system’s Hilbert space that allows $X$ to be thought of as a projective observable. Such an extension can be found for any POVM.

Now let us consider the analog of for other entropies. Consider the generic conditional entropy $H_K(A|B)$ introduced in Sect. \[sct5.2\], based on a generic relative entropy $D_K$. In [@ColesColbeckYuZwolak2012PRL], it was shown that, because of Properties \[a\] and \[b\], $H_K$ is guaranteed to have a *dual* entropy $H_{{\widehat{K}}}$ that is well-defined by $$\label{eqn51}
H_{{\widehat{K}}}(A|B):=-H_K(A|C),$$ where $\rho_{ABC}$ is a purification of $\rho_{AB}$. Again let us apply this duality to ${\tilde{\rho}}_{M_XSE}$ to obtain $H_{{\widehat{K}}}(M_X|E)_{{\tilde{\rho}}}=-H_K(M_X|S)_{{\tilde{\rho}}}$, invoke the standard definition for uncertainty with quantum memory $H_{{\widehat{K}}}(X|E)_{\rho} := H_{{\widehat{K}}}(M_X|E)_{{\tilde{\rho}}}$, and combine this with Theorem \[thm2\] to find: $$\begin{aligned}
\label{eqn52}
H_{{\widehat{K}}}(X|E)= {\mathbb{E}}_K^{M_X| S}=  {\Delta}_K^{\overrightarrow{M_X|S}}={\Delta}_K^{\overrightarrow{S|M_X}}= {\Delta}_K^{\overleftrightarrow{M_X|S}}.\end{aligned}$$ This gives a fairly general connection between an observable’s uncertainty and the quantum correlations created upon its measurement, e.g., applicable when the correlation measures are based on any of the relative entropies in –. For example, because the min- and max-entropies are dual to each other [@KonRenSch09], implies

In fact, according to the expressions on curvature of the space of linear elements (x,y,y’) connected with equation (1) $$\Omega^1_2=a[\omega^2 \wedge \omega^2_1]\,,\quad

Irreversible dynamics
=====================

We now introduce a set of preferred coordinates $\{\, | \xi
\rangle\}$, cf. [@Zeh; @Zurek]. These are the relevant degrees of freedom coupled to the neutron probe. The density matrix needed in (\[a5\]) is then the *reduced* one in the space spanned by these states, and it is obtained by tracing out the (huge number of the) remaining degrees of freedom belonging to the “environment” of the microscopic scattering system (e.g. a proton and its adjacent particles). To simplify notations, we denote this reduced density matrix by $\rho$ too.

In the *subspace* spanned by the preferred coordinates (also denoted ’pointer basis’), we assume the relevant density matrix to obey a Lindblad-type equation of the form [@Lindblad; @Stig1] $$\partial _t\rho =-i\left[ H,\rho \right] +\mathcal{R}\rho \equiv \mathcal{L}%
\rho  \label{b1}$$ with the formal solution $$\rho (t)=e^{\mathcal{L}t}\rho (0).$$

 Let us look at a time-dependent expectation value $$\langle A(t)\rangle \equiv Tr\left( \rho (t)A\right) =Tr\left( e^{\mathcal{L}%
t}\rho (0)A\right) =Tr\left( \rho (0)e^{\mathcal{L}^{\dagger
}t}A\right) \  ,$$ where we define $\mathcal{L}^{\dagger }$ by setting $$Tr\left( \left( \mathcal{L}X\right) Y\right) =Tr\left( X\left( \mathcal{L}%
^{\dagger }Y\right) \right) \  .$$ Thus we obtain a Lindblad time evolution for the operators too by writing $$\partial _tA(t)=\mathcal{L}^{\dagger }A(t).$$ This form was actually the original Lindblad result. Note that this works as long as $\mathcal{L}$ does not depend on time. For time-dependent generators of the evolution, a somewhat more elaborate scheme is needed.

Now we find that we may use this formalism to calculate correlation functions like the one in (\[a6\]). We write $$\langle A(t)B\rangle =Tr\left[ \rho (0)\left

with $x_{1}(t_{0}) = x_{10},\,\,\,x_{2}(t_{0}) = x_{20},\,\,\,0
\leq t_{0} \leq t$, where, $$\begin{aligned}
a_{1} & = & 10,\,\,\,a_{2} = 10\,,\\
h_{1}({{ \mbox{\boldmath $x$} }}) & = & B_{11}\nu_{1}(x_{1}) +
B_{12}\nu_{2}(x_{2}) =-3x_{1} + x_{2} - \tanh(3x_{1})\,,\\
h_{2}({{ \mbox{\boldmath $x$} }}) & = & B_{21}\nu_{1}(x_{1}) +
B_{22}\nu_{2}(x_{2}) = x_{1} - x_{2} + \frac{1}{5}\tanh(3x_{2})\,.\end{aligned}$$ In the form of system (\[noinput2\]), system (\[c4e6\]) can be written as $$\begin{aligned}
\left[\begin{array}{c} x_{1}'(t)\\
x_{2}'(t)
\end{array}
\right] = \left(\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
-10 & 0 \\
0 & -10
\end{array}
\right] +\ \left[
\begin{array}{cc}
-3 - \tau(x_{1}(t)) & 1\\
1 & -1 + \displaystyle\frac{1}{5}\tau(x_{2}(t))
\end{array}\right]\right)\left[
\begin{array}{c}
x_{1}\\
x_{2}
\end{array}
\right]\,,\end{aligned}$$ where for $i = 1,2,$ we define $$\tau(x_{i}(t)) = \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\displaystyle \frac{\tanh(3x_{i})}{x_{i}} & \mbox{$x_{i} \neq 0$}\,,\\
3 & \mbox{$x_{i} = 0$}\,,
\end{array}
\right.$$ noting that $ 0 < \tau(x_{i}) \leq

Let $M$ be a non-minimal local surface in $\mathbb{E}^{4}$. Then the normal transport surface $\widetilde{M}_{H}$ of $M$ in $\mathbb{E}^{4}$ is parallel if and only if the mean curvature vector $\overrightarrow{H}$ of $M$ is parallel in the normal bundle.

Let $M$ be a non-flat local surface in $\mathbb{E}^{4}$ and $\widetilde{M}_{K}$ its normal transport surface. If $\widetilde{M}_{K}$ is a parallel surface of $M$ in $\mathbb{E}^{4}$ then by Theorem 3 $\widetilde{M}_{K}$ has vanishing normal curvature. Furthermore, by the use of (\[5.7.\*\]) we get $$\begin{aligned}
\left( K_{1}\right) _{u}K_{1}+\left( K_{2}\right) _{u}K_{2} &=&0, \\
\left( K_{1}\right) _{v}K_{1}+\left( K_{2}\right) _{v}K_{2} &=&0.\end{aligned}$$Thus, we conclude that $K=\sum \limits_{\alpha =1}^{2}K_{\alpha
}^{2}$ is a constant function, i.e., $M$ has constant Gauss curvature. Thus, we have proved the following result.

Let $M$ be a non-flat local surface in $\mathbb{E}^{4}$. Then the normal transport surface $\widetilde{M}_{K}$ of $M$ in $\mathbb{E}^{4}$ is parallel if and only if the Gaussian curvature of $M$ is a non-zero constant.

Evolute Surfaces in $\mathbb{E}^{4}$
------------------------------------

The normal transport surface $\widetilde{M}$ of $M$ is called evolute surface of $M$ in $\mathbb{E}^{4}$ if the equality $$\left \langle \widetilde{x}_{u_{i}},x_{u_{j}}\right \rangle =0,\text{ }1\leq
i,j\leq 2,  \label{6.1}$$holds for all $x_{u_{j}}\in T_{p}M$ .

Observe that, The tangent $2$-planes at a point $p\in M$ and at the corresponding point $\varphi (p)\in \widetilde{M}$ are mutually orthogonal,

We are interested in the propagation of waves in a waveguide with a bounded penetrable obstacle (Figure \[figsetting\]). We assume that the waveguide coincides with the region ${\Omega}:=\{(x,y)\in{\mathbb{R}}^2\,|\,0<y<1\}$ and that the propagation of waves is governed by the Helmholtz equation with Neumann boundary conditions $$\label{PbInitial}
\begin{array}{|rcll}
\Delta u + k^2\gamma u & = & 0 & \mbox{ in }{\Omega}\\[3pt]
 \partial_y u & = & 0  & \mbox{ on }y=0\mbox{ and }y=1.
\end{array}$$ Here $u$ can represent for instance the acoustic pressure in a compressible fluid, or the transverse component of the displacement field in an elastic solid, or one component of the electromagnetic field in a dielectric medium. $\Delta$ denotes the $\mbox{2D}$ Laplace operator. Moreover $k$ is the wavenumber such that $k={\omega}/c$ where $c$ denotes the waves velocity and ${\omega}$ is the angular frequency, corresponding to a time harmonic dependence in $e^{-i{\omega}t}$. We assume that $\gamma$ is a positive and bounded function such that $\gamma=1$ for $|x|\ge L$ where $L>0$ is given. In other words, the obstacle is located in the region ${\Omega}_L:=\{(x,y)\in{\Omega}\,|\,|x|<L\}$.\
Pick $k\in(N\pi;(N+1)\pi)$, with $N\in{\mathbb{N}}:=\{0,1,\dots\}$. For $n\in{\mathbb{N}}$, set $\beta_n=\sqrt{k^2-n^

In this section, we introduce notation for lattices, Voronoi domains, and Delaunay triangulations.

#### Lattices.

Depending on the context, we interpret an element of ${{\ifmmode{{\mathbb R}}\else{\mbox{\({\mathbb R}\)}}\fi}}^2$ as a point or a vector in the plane. Vectors $a, b \in {{\ifmmode{{\mathbb R}}\else{\mbox{\({\mathbb R}\)}}\fi}}^2$ are *linearly independent* if $\alpha a + \beta b = 0$ implies $\alpha = \beta = 0$. A *lattice* is defined by two linearly independent vectors, $a, b \in {{\ifmmode{{\mathbb R}}\else{\mbox{\({\mathbb R}\)}}\fi}}^2$, and consists of all integer combinations of these vectors: $$\begin{aligned}
  L(a,b)  &=  \{ ia + jb \mid i, j \in {{\ifmmode{{\mathbb Z}}\else{\mbox{\({\mathbb Z}\)}}\fi}}\} .\end{aligned}$$ Its *fundamental domain* is the parallelogram of points $\alpha a + \beta b$ with real numbers $0 \leq \alpha, \beta \leq 1$. Writing ${{\ifmmode{\|{a}\|}\else{\mbox{\(\|{a}\|\)}}\fi}}$ for the length of the vector and $\gamma$ for the angle between $a$ and $b$, the area of the fundamental domain is $\det L(a,b) = {{\ifmmode{\|{a}\|}\else{\mbox{\(\|{a}\|\)}}\fi}} {{\ifmmode{\|{b}\|}\else{\mbox{\(\|{b}\|\)}}\fi}} \sin(\gamma)$. The same lattice is generated by different pairs of vectors, and we will see shortly that at least one of these pairs defines a non-obtuse triangle. We will be more specific about this condition shortly, as it is instrumental in our proof of the optimality of the regular hexagonal grid.

#### Voronoi domain.

Given a lattice $L$, the *Voronoi domain* of a point $p \in L$ is the set of points for which $p$ is the closest: $$\begin{aligned}
  V(p)  &=  \{ x \in {{\ifmmode{{\mathbb

We now state a result on mutual contiguity of measures.

\[prop:norcont\](Janson’s second moment method): Let $\mathbb{P}_n$ and $\mathbb{Q}_n$ be two sequences of probability measures such that for each $n$, both are defined on the common $\sigma$-algebra $(\Omega_n, \mathcal{F}_n)$. Suppose that for each $i\geq 1$, $W_{n,i}$ are random variables defined on $(\Omega_n,\mathcal{F}_n)$. Then the probability measures $\mathbb{P}_n$ and $\mathbb{Q}_n$ are asymptotically mutually contiguous if the following conditions hold simultaneously:

(i) $\mathbb{Q}_n$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\mathbb{P}_n$ for each $n$;

(ii) The likelihood ratio statistic $Y_n = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbb{Q}_n}{\mathrm{d}\mathbb{P}_n}$ satisfies $$\label{eq:lr-square}

(iii) For any fixed $k\ge 1$, one has $\left( W_{n,1},\ldots, W_{n,k} \right)|\mathbb{P}_{n} \stackrel{d}{\to} \left(Z_{1}, \ldots, Z_{k}\right) $ and $\left( W_{n,1},\ldots, W_{n,k} \right)|\mathbb{Q}_{n} \stackrel{d}{\to} \left(Z'_{1}, \ldots, Z'_{k}\right)$. Further $Z_{i}\sim N(0,\sigma_{i}^{2})$ and $Z'_{i} \sim N(\mu_{i},\sigma_{i}^{2})$ are sequences of independent random variables.

Ideally, by using this approach it is possible to obtain a superposition containing one fourth of the “closest” states to a goal configuration by applying a single iteration of Grover’s algorithm. Additionally, we can further expand on the results of Expression \[eq:unitaryOperatorWithExtendedHeuristicV1\] in order to contemplate different sections of a probability distribution. For instance, we can choose to obtain in a single iteration of Grover’s algorithm the states which lie between heuristic values $(F^{-1}(0.5) - F^{-1}(0.25))$. Similarly, we could also choose to obtain the states belonging to $(F^{-1}(0.75) - F^{-1}(0.5))$ or $(F^{-1}(1) - F^{-1}(0.75))$. More generally, let $a$ and $b$ denote two probabilities values such that $b - a = 0.25$, then it is possible to determine if a given heuristic value belongs to the range $[F^{-1}(a), F^{-1}(b)]$. This strategy for selecting $25\%$ of the search space is presented in the unitary operator shown in Expression \[eq:unitaryOperatorWithExtendedHeuristicV2\],

We prove the assertion by induction on $n$. For $n=1$, $t=a \in V$. So, $\Delta(a)=0$ and the assertion is true.

For $n>1$, we consider two cases. First, if $t$ is an irreducible, then $t=t'\circ a_n$, where $t'$ is a tree of degree $(n-1)$, with vertices $a_1,\ldots,a_{n-1}$. In this case, note that $t'=t_{\{a_1,\ldots,a_{n-1}\}}$ and the vertices $a_1,\ldots,a_{n-1}$ preserve the order that they originally had in $t$. Moreover, if $1\leq k \leq l \leq n-1$, then $t'_{\{a_k,a_{k+1},\ldots,a_l\}}=t_{\{a_k,a_{k+1},\ldots,a_l\}}$.

By definition of coproduct $\Delta$ and by a recursive argument, we have that $$\begin{array}{rcl}
\Delta(t) & = & \Delta(t'\circ a_n) \\
          & = & \Delta(t')\circ a_n+t'\circ \Delta(a_n)+t'\otimes a_n\\
          & = & \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{n-2}t'_{\{a_1,\ldots,a_i\}}\otimes t'_{\{a_{i+1},\ldots,a_{n-1}\}}\circ a_n+t'\otimes a_n  \\

Leading order dilepton production rate {#prod_rate}
--------------------------------------

The relation between the dilepton emission rate and thermal expectation values of electromagnetic current correlation function $$\label{current}
W^{\mu\nu}=\int d^4x \, e^{-iq\cdot x}\langle J^{\mu}(x)J^{\nu}(0)\rangle,$$ is well described in refs. [@W; @Weldon:1990iw; @book]. Here we briefly summarize the main results for the specific case of a $q \bar{q} \rightarrow e^+e^- $ process, shown in figure \[feyLO\].

![LO Feynmann diagram for the thermal dilepton production from the QGP.[]{data-label="feyLO"}](photon_LO)

The number of dileptons produced per unit volume and emitted at a given total momentum $P=(p^0,p^i)$ can be expressed trough the dilepton rate $R$: $$\frac{d N^{\ell \bar \ell}(x,P)}{d^4x d^4P}=\frac{dR(x,P)}{d^4 P},$$ which in turn can be calculated form the quark current correlator $W^{\mu\nu}(P)$ as: $$\begin{aligned}
\frac{dR^{\ell \bar \ell}}{d^{4}P}&=&\sum_{i=1}^{n_f} Q_i^2\frac{\alpha_e^2}{24\pi^3P^2}\left(1+\frac{2m^2}{P^2}\right)\left(1-\frac{4m^2}{P^2}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\\&&\quad\quad\times\, \theta \left(P^2-4m^2 \right)W_{\mu}^{\mu}(P).\notag\end{aligned}$$ where $m$ is the mass of the emitted leptons and $Q_i,\, i=1,...,n_f$ the charges of the $n_f$ massless quarks present in the plasma. The strong coupling only enters in the quark current correlator $W^{\mu\nu}(P)$, which is calculated below at leading order but which receives large higher order corrections. If we restrict to leading order and to the case where the lepton mass is negligible compared to the invariant mass $M=\sqrt{P^2}\gg m$, which is

Stellar populations contain the histories of evolution of the baryonic components of galaxies. Accessing this information is complicated by the presence of multiple stellar population components projected along each sightline, effects of interstellar dust on observed spectral energy distributions, and the relatively low brightnesses of outer regions of galaxies relative to the sky. Multi-band UV through near-IR ($\sim$200–1100nm) measurements from space are required to derive extinction corrected stellar SEDs with sufficient precision to distinguish differences in metallicity and age. Unraveling the star formation histories of nearby galaxies (and spatial variations therein) *in detail* requires one to resolve individual stars to ${\mbox{\rlap{\hbox{\lower3pt\hbox{\ensuremath{\sim}}}}\raise2pt\hbox{\ensuremath{>}}}}$1mag below the Tip of the RGB (TRGB). Although [*HST*]{} would in theory be capable of accessing the TRGB out to $\sim$12Mpc, in practice *very* few studies have been able to push beyond 7Mpc because of [*HST*]{}’s limited aperture (exposure times comparable to those in the Deep and Ultradeep Fields would be required). A particularly novel opportunity enabled by a larger aperture and similar or higher resolution would be to resolve red K-giant stars within star streams known to exist within the Virgo Cluster in the form of structure in the diffuse intra-cluster light. This would allow unraveling for the first time the 3D structure, kinematics and galaxy assembly history within the Virgo Cluster. *Space-based wide-field high-resolution optical–near-IR imaging would open up a new window of discovery space that remains inaccessible to or exceedingly inefficient with next-generation giant ground-based telescopes*.

Previous space-based UV–near-IR imaging facilities, however, emphasized either low spatial resolution and wide fields (, [*GALEX*]{}; strictly UV, minimal filter set \[$n$=2\]) or high resolution and small fields (, [*HST*]{}). For a study of both the resolved stellar populations *and* its dependence on the global structure and evolution of nearby galaxies, one would need to combine:\

-   a large field of view (FoV) that is well-matched to the angular sizes of nearby galaxies and their satellite systems;

-   sensitivity to detect at ${\mbox{\rlap{\hbox{\lower3pt\hbox{\ensuremath{\sim}}}}\raise2pt\hbox{\ensuremath{>}}}}$5$\sigma$ individual RGB stars to ${\

Thus, the B-S equation can be rewritten as: $$\renewcommand\theequation{A.5}
\chi _P(q)=S_1(p_1)\eta (q_{P_{\perp}})S_2(p_2),$$ where $$\eta (q_{P^\mu _{\perp}})=\int\frac{d^3k_{P_\perp}}{(2\pi )^3}V(k^\mu _{P_\perp}, q^\mu _{P_\perp})\varphi (k^\mu _{P_\perp}).$$

The full Salpeter equation takes the form: $$\renewcommand\theequation{A.6}
\begin{aligned}
\left(M-\omega _{1p}-\omega _{2p}\right)\varphi ^{++}(q_{P_\perp})&=\Lambda^+_1(P_{1p_{\perp}}) \eta (q_{P_{\perp}}) \Lambda_2^+ (P_{2p_{\perp}}),\\

In order to do the numerical integral, we need the explicit form of integral kernel. In this work, we choose the Cornell potential, which was widely used in this interaction. The Cornell potential is the sum of a linear scalar interaction and a vector interaction.

There are two main reasons why getting an exact solution to a classical field theory is an important step beyond. A classical solution may give a clever understanding of the physics underlying the theory itself and secondly, but not less important, one can build a quantum field theory out of such a solution using perturbation theory. Indeed, somewhat striking may happen already at a classical level for a classical field theory. A very blatant example of this is given by spontaneous breaking of symmetry. We see, already at the classical level, a non trivial behavior of the theory that has as an important side effect mass generation for all other coupled fields.

Generally speaking, we do not have many of such exact solutions. What we do most of times is perturbation theory starting from the solutions of the free theory that, being linear, is straightforwardly solved. For a lot of interesting cases our ability is just limited by the fact that we have to cope with non-linear equations whose solutions are rarely known.

Recently, we published a paper where we were able the obtain both the spectrum and the Feynman propagator in the infrared of a scalar theory [@fra1]. Our aim here is to reconsider this theory in the classical limit to obtain the unexpected results that the behavior of the exact classical solution is the same of the quantum field theory in the infrared we derived giving in this way a consistent mathematical support to our previous conclusions.

So, we start by writing down the action for the theory we aim to solve. One has $$S = \int d^4x\left[\frac{1}{2}(\partial\phi)^2-\frac{\lambda}{4}\phi^4\right].$$ We just note that for this theory holds conformal invariance having no mass term and does not have any dimensional parameter being $\lambda$, the coupling, adimensional. So, Euler-Lagrange equation reduces in this case to the equation of motion $$\label{eq:phi}
    \ddot\phi-\Delta_2\phi+\lambda\phi^3=0.$$ We can write down immediately an exact solution of this equation being given by $$\label{eq:phis}
    \phi(x)=\mu\left(\frac{2}{\lambda}\right)^{\frac{1}{4}}{\rm sn}(p\cdot x+\theta,i)$$ being ${\rm sn}$ the Jacobi snoidal function, $\mu$ and $\theta$ two integration constants. The first has the dimension of a mass while the other, being just a phase, is ad

abstract: 'A classical result (often credited to Y. Medvedev) states that every language recognized by a finite automaton is the homomorphic image of a local language, over a much larger so-called local alphabet, namely the alphabet of the edges of the transition graph. Local languages are characterized by the value $k=2$ of the sliding window width in the McNaughton and Papert’s infinite hierarchy of strictly locally testable languages ($k$-slt). We generalize Medvedev’s result in a new direction, studying the relationship between the width and the alphabetic ratio telling how much larger the local alphabet is. We prove that every regular language is the image of a $k$-slt language on an alphabet of doubled size, where the width logarithmically depends on the automaton size, and we exhibit regular languages for which any smaller alphabetic ratio is insufficient. More generally, we express the trade-off between alphabetic ratio and width as a mathematical relation derived from a careful encoding of the states. At last we mention some directions for theoretical development and application.'

Conclusion {#SectConclusion}
==========

We have generalized Medvedev’s homomorphic characterization of regular languages: instead of using as generator a local language over a large alphabet, which depends on the complexity of the regular language, we can use a strictly locally testable language over a smaller alphabet that does not depend on complexity, but just on the source alphabet. We have proved that the smallest alphabet one can use in the generator is the double of the alphabet of the regular language; thus, for instance, four symbols suffice to homomorphically generate any regular binary language.

In the main proof we have offered a specific and fairly optimized construction of the strictly locally testable language, for which we have derived the relationship between the width, the alphabetic ratio, and the complexity of the regular language. In our opinion, the construction should be of its own interest, as a new technique for simulating a NFA by means of a larger, yet strictly locally testable, machine. Our encoding is asymptotically optimal with respect to language complexity, and remains very close to the theoretical optimum for finite values of complexity.

These conditions, which roughly mean that the transformation is expanding in some (topologically) large region of $M$ but may admit contracting behavior in the complement, are satisfied a large class of local diffeomorphisms obtained by a local bifurcation of an expanding transformation.

We will denote by $\phi: M \to \mathbb R$ an ${\alpha}$-Hölder continuous potential with small oscillation, in the sense that it satisfies

-   $\sup\phi-\inf\phi < \log \deg(f) - \log q$.

and condition (H3b) stated at the beginning of Subsection \[subsec.spectral.gap\]. These conditions are clearly satisfied by an open class of potentials containing the constant ones. Note that (H1), (H2) and (H3a) are the assumptions in [@OV07].

Equilibrium states and conformal measures
-----------------------------------------

Given a continuous transformation $f:M\to M$ and a continuous potential $\phi:M \to \mathbb R$, an invariant probability measure $\mu$ is an *equilibrium state* for $f$ with respect to $\phi$ if it attains the supremum $${P_{{\operatorname{top}}}}(f,\phi)
    = \sup\Big\{h_\eta(f)+\int \phi\,d\eta :  \eta \; \text{is $f$-invariant}\Big\}$$ given by the variational principle for the pressure (see e.g. [@Wa82]). The *Ruelle-Perron-Frobenius operator* ${\mathcal{L}}_\phi$ is the linear operator that acts in the space $C(M)$ of continuous functions by $${\mathcal{L}}_\phi g (x)= \sum_{f(y)=x} e^{\phi(y)} g(y).$$ The action of the dual operator ${\mathcal{L}}_\phi^*$ on the space $\mathcal
M (M)$ of probability measures is given by $\int g \,d{\mathcal{L}}^*_\phi
\nu= \int {\mathcal{L}}_\phi g\, d\nu$ for every $g \in C(M)$. We say that a measure $\nu$ is *conformal* if there exists a strictly positive function $J_\nu f$ (Jacobian of $\nu$ with

We study the popular model used in the studies of influence estimation and maximization, the discrete-time Independent Cascade model [@kempe2003maximizing]. An instance of the IC model is defined on a graph $G=(V,E)$ with $V$ and $E \subseteq V \times V$ denoting the set of nodes and pairwise edges, respectively. At any time, a node $i$ can be in either inactive or active state. A node $i$ activated at a time $t$ has a single chance to activate its neighbor $j$ at the subsequent time $t+1$ with probability $b_{ij}$ associated with the edge $(i,j) \in E$. Each realization of this diffusion process can be interpreted in terms of a live-edge graph [@kempe2003maximizing] defined on the set of nodes $V$ and described by a set of binary random variables $\mathbf{d} = \{ d_{ij} \}_{(i,j) \in E}$ associated with edges in the graph. Each edge $(i,j) \in E$ is declared *live* randomly with probability $b_{ij}$ (in which case we set $d_{ij} = 1$), and *blocked* otherwise (and thus characterized by $d_{ij} = 0$). Given the *seeds*, i.e. a set $S$ of active nodes at initial time $t=0$, the set of eventually influenced nodes is given by the set of nodes that are connected to nodes in $S$ via the live edges. We will say that node $i$ is *reachable* from node $j$ in time $t$ on graph $G$ if there exists a path connecting $i$ and $j$ such that $d_{ij} = 1$ along all edges of this path and its length is smaller or equal to $t$. Additionally, for the reasons that will become clear later, in the definition of reachable nodes we exclude paths that traverse the same edge multiple times.

Another model that has been considered in the context of influence estimation and maximization is the Linear Threshold model [@granovetter1978threshold], where to each node $i$ is associated a certain activation threshold $\theta_i \in [0,1]$, and $i$ activates if the following condition is satisfied: $\sum_{j \in \partial i} b_{ji} x_{j} \geq

The model assumes that the coupling between the concentrations of the biochemical species is realized through nonlinear reaction terms, appearing in the perforated domain and at the boundary of the inclusions, as well. In particular, the coupling phenomenon at the boundary of the inclusions is described by imposing different nonlinear flux conditions for the three concentration fields. The nonlinear functions appearing in these flux conditions depend on the concentrations of the three species and are properly scaled, depending on the processes occurring at the membranes of the cellular organelles. The nonlinearities of our model were inspired by kinetics corresponding to multi-species enzyme catalyzed reactions, which are generalizations of the classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics to multi-species reactions. A rigorous mathematical model for such processes is analyzed in [@Gahn]$\div$[@Gahn3], but with a different scaling and taking into account more complex phenomena.\
The main mathematical difficulties behind our study come from the strong coupling between the equations governing the evolution of the concentrations of the biochemical species and, also, from the particular scaling of the nonlinear boundary terms. As a matter of fact, the novelty of our paper consists exactly in the special coupling and scaling of the boundary terms. The form of the nonlinearities arising at the microscale and this non-standard coupling lead, at the macroscale, to the appearance of additional source or sink terms and of a non-standard diffusion matrix, which is not constant (see Theorem \[teounf\] and Corollary \[teohom\]). Hence, we show that some fast reactions occurring, at the microscale, on the boundaries of $S^\varepsilon$ (see the second equation in system ) could lead, at the macroscale, to a cross - diffusion system (see for this terminology the recent papers [@JP] and [@J]).\
The metabolic pathway which our system better fits is the fatty acid activation on the outer mitochondrial membrane (see [@Enz]). Such a reactive system involves three metabolites, a fatty acid, the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the coenzyme A (CoA), which can diffuse in the cytosol and can also react on the mitochondrial membrane with different rate, with ATP being the slowest one. They can react in the cytosol thanks to the enzyme acyl coa - synthetase present on the outer mitochondrial membrane. Since this metabolic pathway is strongly ATP-dependent, the concentration of ATP itself limits the mithocondrial availability of fatty acid and CoA. This aspect could well explain why, in our limit problem, the effective diffusion matrices of the fastest metabolites

Few-electron gate-defined quantum dots[@hanson] are exploited for single spin manipulation that allows for realization of single-qubit quantum gates.[@loss] While the desired spin rotation involves a single spin as a carrier of quantum information, multielectron systems provide a feasible environment for readout of the controlled spin. Strong spin-orbit (SO) coupling that is present in InSb and InAs nanowires [@fasth; @pfund] allows for electrical spin rotations[@nowack] that are performed by electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR)[@golovach] which excludes the need for introduction of local magnetic field gradients[@laird; @koppens] or usage of hyperfine interaction.[@osika] The readout of the spin is realized via spin to charge conversion that relies on the Pauli spin blockade.[@ono] The single electron current $(1,0)\rightarrow(1,1)\rightarrow(2,0)\rightarrow(1,0)$ \[the numbers in the brackets correspond to the number of electrons in a particular dot\] is blocked at the transition from $(1,1)$ triplet to $(2,0)$ singlet. Rotation of one of the spins of electrons constituting the $(1,1)$ triplet unblocks the current which serves as a proof for the coherent spin control. On the other hand strong SO coupling leads to unavoidable spin relaxation which results in a spontaneous lifting of the Pauli blockade when one of the $(1,1)$ triplets is close in energy to the $(2,0)$ singlet.[@nowak2014]

EDSR lifting of the current blockade is observed already for two electrons bound in the double dot, which indeed is the case for many of the experiments.[@nadj-perge; @nadj2012; @schroer; @frolov] However some of the experimentally studied devices consist an even number $N$ of electrons greater than two.[@berg; @petersson; @stehlik] In this case the system is biased such the Pauli blockade is between $(N-1,1)$ and $(N,0)$ states. It is assumed that such configuration is equivalent to the two-electron system.[@rossella] This approximation resembles the well established concept in chemistry, that the valence electrons are responsible for creation of bonds and the rest in the deep levels can be treated as the frozen core.[@fc] This assumption seems questionable for quantum dots in which the single-electron shells are separated by much smaller energies than for the Coulomb potential, nevertheless this problem

: Suppose $T^*=\underset{T}{\arg\min}(\mathcal{L_{ATS}})$ on validation set $\mathcal{V}$. Therefore, $S_{y=k}(x,T^*)$ approaches $Q(y=k|x)$ for $k=1,\ldots,K$ and consequently $S_{y}(x,T^*)$ approaches toward $Q(y|x)$ which means $\mathcal{L_{ATS}}$ is a calibration measure.

#### Proof

: The samples in subset $M_k$ are supposed to be generated from $Q(x,y=k)$ distribution. Based on Gibbs inequality (refer to Eq. (1)) minimizing negative log of likelihood function on $M_k$ samples leads that likelihood function to approach $Q(y=k|x)$. In $M_k$ there are two groups of samples. The samples which are originally generated from $Q(x,y=k)$ distribution and have the true label $y_i = k$ and the samples which are borrowed from other distributions as the surrogate samples for $Q(x,y=k)$ and their true labels are $y_i\not=k$. These two groups of samples have different probability weights. Therefore, to converge to $Q(y=k|x)$, the loss function should differ based on the type of the samples. $\mathcal{L_{ATS}}$ is defined as:

$
\begin{aligned}
   \mathcal{L_{ATS}} &= \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{(x_i,y_i) \in M_k}\\
           & -\log \left ( \frac{S_{y=k}(x_i,T)(1-S_{y = y_i}(x_i,T))}{S_{y\not=k}(x_i,T)} \right ) \\
    \text{where} & \quad  T^* = \operatorname*{arg\,min}_{T}(\mathcal{L_{ATS}}) 
    \quad \quad \text{s.t:}\quad T > 0
\end{aligned}
$

which can be analyzed for two cases:

-   **Case I**: In this case, the samples are $(x_i,y_i=k)$ which means they are generated directly from $Q(x,y=k)$. The likelihood function

[**Theorem 2:**]{} [*[@Pico04] If the deterministic part $S_0$ of the MSR-action (\[msr\]) is Galilei-invariant such that (\[Barg\]) holds true, then*]{} $$\begin{aligned}
R(t,s) &=& R_0^{(2)}(t,s) \\
C(t,s) &=& \frac{a_0}{2}\int\!{\rm d}\vec{r}\; 
R_0^{(3)}(t,s,0;\vec{r}) + T \int\!{\rm d}u{\rm d}\vec{r}\;
R_0^{(3)}(t,s,u;\vec{r})\end{aligned}$$ [*where the two-point function $R_0^{(2)}(t,s)=\langle\phi(t,\vec{y})\widetilde{\phi}(s,\vec{y})\rangle_0$ and the three-point function $R_0^{(3)}(t,s,u;\vec{r})=\langle \phi(t,\vec{y})\phi(s,\vec{y})
\widetilde{\phi}^2(u,\vec{r}+\vec{y})\rangle_0$ are fixed by the deterministic part $S_0$.*]{}

To see this, one merely has to include the noise term $S_b[\widetilde{\phi}]$ into the average, viz. $R=\langle\phi\widetilde{\phi}\rangle=
\langle\phi\widetilde{\phi}e^{-S_b[\widetilde{\phi}]}\rangle_0
=\langle\phi\widetilde{\phi}\rangle_0$ because of the Bargman superselection rule (\[Barg\]). $C(t,s)$ is found similarly. q.e.d.

Consequently, given the Galilei-invariance of the deterministic part, one can find the contributions of both the thermal and the initial noise. Remarkably, the response function is noise-independent, whereas the correlator vanishes in the absence of noise.

Finally, we have to address the question whether the deterministic part of the Langevin equation (\[lang\]) can be Galilei-invariant. At first sight, the answer seems to be negative, since a well-known mathematical fact [@Fush93] states that the non-linear Schrödinger equation $$\left(2m{\rm i}\partial_t - \Delta \right)\phi

Let $x_0$ be a $q$-rational number, i.e., $$x_0=x^{(1)} _0=\Delta^{q} _{\alpha_1\alpha_2...\alpha_{m-1}\alpha_m 000...}=\Delta^{q} _{\alpha_1\alpha_2...\alpha_{m-1}[\alpha_m-1] [q-1][q-1][q-1]...}=x^{(2)} _0.$$ Then there exist positive integers $k^{*}$ and $k_0$ such that $$y_1=g\left(x^{(1)} _0\right)=\Delta^{g(x)} _{\alpha_{n_1}\alpha_{n_2}...\alpha_{n_{k^{*}}}...\alpha_{n_{k_0}}000...},$$ $$y_2=g\left(x^{(2)} _0\right)=\Delta^{g(x)} _{\alpha_{n_1}\alpha_{n_2}...\alpha_{n_{k^{*}-1}}[\alpha_{n_{k^{*}}}-1]\alpha_{n_{k^{*}+1}}...\alpha_{n_{k_0}}[q-1][q-1][q-1]...}.$$ Here $n_{k^{*}}=m$, $n_{k^{*}}\le n_{k_0}$, and $k_0$ is a number such that $\alpha_{n_{k_0}}\in\{\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_{m-1}, \alpha_m\}$ and ${k_0}$ is the maximum position of any number from $\{1,2,\dots , m\}$ in the sequence $(n_k)$.

Let us consider a fact (Section 2 in [@Symon2019] and the paper [@Salem1943], since such expansion of numbers is an analytic representation the Salem function) that a representation $\Delta^{g(x)} _{\alpha_{1}\alpha_{2}...\alpha_{k}...}$ is the following whenever the conditions $(n_k)=(k)$ and $p_j>0$ for all $j=\overline{0,q-1}$, where $k=1,2, \dots $, hold: $$\label{eq: Pq}
[0,1]\ni x=\Delta^{P_q} _{\alpha_{1}\alpha_{2}...\alpha_{k}...}=\

We begin this section by describing the methods that we implemented, then we briefly discuss the training procedure, and finally report the results.

Methods Compared
----------------

We included seven methods in our experiments. One classic generative model (Naive Bayes), one classic discriminative model (Logistic Regression), one widely used neural network model (fasttext), and four models based on the state-of-the-art model Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). Below we briefly describe each one.

***NB*.** We included the Naive Bayes classifier. We incorporated the MALLET implementation [@mallet] of this classifier, and used the tweet unigrams and bigrams as features.

***LR*.** We included the Logistic Regression as the discriminative counterpart of Naive Bayes. We incorporated the MALLET implementation, and again used the tweet unigrams and bigrams as features.

***Fasttext*.** We included the neural model introduced in [@fasttext]. This model is a shallow wide network, capable of updating the input word embeddings during the training. We used the pretrained word2vec vectors [@word2vec] as input features. The learning rate was empirically set to 0.5, and the window size was set to 2.

***BERT-BASE*.** We included the state-of-the-art model introduced in [@bert]. This model is based on a multi-layer transformer encoder [@transformer]. We used the pre-trained base variant, followed by one layer fully connected network. We applied the default model settings recommended in [@bert]. We used the pytorch implementation of BERT introduced in [@bert-impl].

***BERT-Twitter*.** Since our classification problem is defined on social media posts, we can expect that a model specifically exposed to the social media language model (through the Masked Language model task) would perform better than regularly pre-trained ones. Thus, we used a corpus of 35 million tweets collected between 2018 and 2019 through the Twitter streaming API to further pre-train *BERT-BASE*. We set the maximum window size to 160 and batch-size to 32–the rest of the settings were set to the default values, as suggested in [@bert]–and pre-trained this model for 4.5 million steps–about 5 epochs.

***BERT-Corona*.** We hypothesized that if a model is already familiar

The temperature dependence of the magnetic scattering, along with the corresponding magnetization measurements performed on a sample from the same batch using a Quantum Design Magnetic Properties Measurement System, are shown in Fig. \[fig3\]. The magnetic order parameter was measured at the ($\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{9}{2}$) peak position as the sample temperature was increased during a temperature scan in the absence of the polarization analyzer. These data were supplemented by measurements of the integrated intensity of the ($\frac{1}{2}$ -$\frac{1}{2}$ $\frac{13}{2}$) magnetic Bragg peak at selected temperatures and with polarization analysis. The line in Fig. \[fig3\](b) describes a fit to the integrated intensity data using a power law of the form $I\,\sim\,(1-\frac{T}{T_N})^{2\beta}$ yielding $T_N$ = 8.52$\pm$0.05K and $\beta$ = 0.33$\pm$0.02. The close proximity of $T_N$ determined from our scattering measurements and the peak in d\[($M/H$)T\]/d$T$ (Ref.) at $T$ = 8.6K, again confirms the magnetic origin of the Bragg scattering with a propagation vector of $\textbf{q}_m$ = ($\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{1}{2}$). Systematic $M$ versus $H$ measurements (not shown) demonstrate in addition that no spontaneous ferromagnetic moment is present.

Full and dashed lines represent calculations for selected magnetic moment directions in a single magnetic domain, and for intensity from equally populated domains averaged over the three possible symmetry-equivalent magnetic moment orientations, respectively.[]{data-label="fig4"}](fig4 "fig:"){width="0.88\linewidth"}\

Having established the nature of the magnetic ordering in GdBiPt, we now describe our attempt to determine the direction of the ordered magnetic moment. The angular dependence of the resonant magnetic intensity $I(\psi)$ for the incident $\sigma$-polarized beam depends upon the component of the magnetic moment along the scattered beam direction and

The general solution of the infinite system is provided by the implicit *generalized hodograph* formula [@17] $$\label{3.22}
x+\sum_{n\in \mathbb{Z}-\{0\}}\Lambda^i_n({{\boldsymbol{R}}})\, x_n=\Gamma^i({{\boldsymbol{R}}}),
\quad i=1,\ldots,N,$$ where the functions $\Gamma^i$ are the general solution of the linear system $$\label{3.23}
\frac{D_j \Gamma^i}{\Gamma^j-\Gamma^i}=
\frac{1}{f^j-f^i},\quad i\neq j.$$ By introducing the potential function $\Phi({{\boldsymbol{R}}})$ $$\Gamma^i=D_i\Phi,\quad i=1,\ldots,N,$$ the system reduces to the Laplace type form $$\label{3.24}
(f^i-f^j)D_iD_j\Phi=D_i\Phi-D_j\Phi,\quad i\neq j,$$ the general solution of which depends on $N$ arbitrary functions of one variable.

In particular it is immediate to deduce [@16] that the generating function provides a one-parameter family of solutions of . Thus we can produce important solutions of from linear superpositions of $G(\lambda,{{\boldsymbol{R}}})$. For example $$\begin{aligned}
\Lambda^i_n&=D_i\Phi,\;\; \Phi:=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\gamma_{\infty}}
\lambda^n G(\lambda,{{\boldsymbol{R}}}){\operatorname{d}}\lambda,\quad n\geq 0,\\
\Lambda^i_{-n}&=D_i\Phi,\;\; \Phi:=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\gamma_0}
\lambda^{-n} G(\lambda,{{\boldsymbol{R}}}){\operatorname{d}}\lambda,\quad n> 0.\end{aligned}$$ Furthermore, in several important cases the general solution of can be written in terms of $G(\lambda,{{\boldsymbol{R}}})$.

[**Examples** ]{}

If we set $$f^i(R^i)=\frac{R^i}{n},\quad n=1,2,\ldots,$$ then the generating function (non normalized as $\lambda\rightarrow\infty$) is $$G(\lambda,{{\boldsymbol{R}}})=\

Now, choose $x\in X$ and set $x_n=T^nx$ $(n\in{\mathbb{N}})$. Since $T$ is assumed to be asymptotically regular, we have $d(x_n,x_{n+1})\to0$. Hence, holds, for any two subsequences $\{x_{p_i}\}$ and $\{x_{q_i}\}$. By Theorem \[thm:main\], the sequence $\{T^nx\}$ is Cauchy and, since $X$ is complete, it converges to some point $z\in X$. Since $T$ is sequentially continuous, we have $Tz=z$.

Let ${\cal M}_l$ denote the set of probability measures on the Borel-measurable subsets of ${{\mathbb R}}^l$. Then a pseudometric $d:{{\cal M}}_l \times {{\cal M}}_l\rightarrow {{\mathbb R}}^+_0$ is called ‘well-behaved’ if the distance between $P_Z$ and $\hat{P}_{Z_1(\omega'),\dots,Z_k(\omega')}$ converges in probability to zero uniformly over all i.i.d. sequences. More precisely, for every $\epsilon,\delta>0$ there is a $k_0$ such that for all $k\geq k_0$ $$P_{\Omega'} \left\{ d(P_Z,\hat{P}_{Z_1(\omega'),\dots,Z_k(\omega')}) \geq \epsilon \right\} \leq \delta,$$ holds for all sequences $Z_1,Z_2,\dots$ and probability spaces $(\Omega',\Sigma',P_{\Omega'})$.

For distributions $Q,R$ on ${{\mathbb R}}$ with cumulative distribution functions $F_Q$ and $F_R$, respectively, $d(Q,R):=\|F_Q-F_R\|_\infty$ provides a simple example of a well-behaved distance since $$\|F_{\hat{Q}_k} -F_Q\|_\infty \geq \epsilon,$$ occurs with probability at most $2e^{-2k \epsilon^2}$ due to Massart’s formulation [@Massart90] of the Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowith (DKW) inequality. Another example is given by $d(Q,R):=\sup_B |Q(B)-R(B)|$ where $B$ runs over some set of sets whose indicator functions have finite VC-dimension. This follows from Vapnik and Chervonenkis’ uniform bound on the deviation of empirical frequencies of events from the corresponding probabilities [@vapnik98]. Using Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) one can construct a further example: the so-called kernel mean embedding [@smola2007] represents distributions as vectors in a Hilbert space. Then the Hilbert space distance is a well-behaved metric. This follows easily from the uniform consistency result in [@gretton2006 Theorem 4] for the empirical estimator of this distance[^2].

Fix $t \ge 2t_0+2$. The upper density of a packing $\mathscr{Z}$ of $\hspace{2pt} \mathbb{R}^3$ by $t$-cylinders satisfies the inequality

$$\rho^+(\mathscr{Z}) \le \frac{t}{\frac{\sqrt{12}}{\pi}(t-2-2t_0) + (2t_0)+\frac{4}{3}}.$$

Assume there exists a packing by $t$-cylinders exceeding the stated bound. Then Lemma \[nestdensity\] gives a packing of capped $(t-2)$-cylinders with density greater than

$$\left(\frac{ t - \frac{2}{3} }{t}\right)\cdot \left(\frac{t}{\frac{\sqrt{12}}{\pi}(t-2-2t_0) + (2t_0)+\frac{4}{3}}\right) =  \left(\frac{t-2+\frac{4}{3}}{\frac{\sqrt{12}}{\pi}(t-2-2t_0) + (2t_0)+\frac{4}{3}}\right).$$

This contradicts the density bound of Theorem \[main\] for capped $(t-2)$-cylinders.

Set Up {#setup}
======

For the remainder of the paper, fix the notation $\mathscr{C}^*$ to be the restriction of $\mathscr{C}$ to $B(R-2/\sqrt{3})$, indexed by $I^*$. To bound the density $\rho(\mathscr{C}^*,R-2/\sqrt{3},R)$ for a fixed packing $\mathscr{C}$ and a fixed $R \ge 2/\sqrt{3}$, decompose $B(R)$ into regions $D_i$ with disjoint interiors such that $C_i \subseteq D_i$ for all $i$ in $I^*$. For such a packing $\mathscr{C}^*$ with fixed $R$, define the *Dirichlet cell* $D_i$ of a capped $t$-cylinder $C_i$ to be the set of points in $B(R)$ no further from the axis $a_i$ of $C_i$ than from any other axis $a_j$ of $C_j$.

For any point $x$ on axis $a_i$, define a plane $

This defines a measure-preserving transformation (mapping $\theta$ to $\eta$) which has a Bernoulli factor. When is it Bernoulli? The $M/M/1$ queue corresponds to the special case where $\T=\{-1,1\}$, $1-\kappa\{-1\}=\kappa\{1\}=q<1/2$ and $f_{\theta}(x)=\max\{x+\theta,0\}$. Examples of iterated random functions where Theorem \[burke2\] applies can be found in [@dyson] and [@oc03]. Further examples which arise from taking products of random matrices, and for which the invariant measure is known explicitly, are discussed in the paper [@mtw]; note however that not all of these are reversible.

Profiles across filaments {#sect:proffilament}
=========================

![Location of the regions used to measure the thermal properties across the filaments, displayed on a 0.3 to 1 keV image. Each of the 80 regions is $1\times27.3$ arcsec in size.[]{data-label="fig:filamentregions"}](fig15.jpg.eps){width="\columnwidth"}

To investigate the thermal structure of the X-ray filaments associated with the H$\alpha$ nebula in detail, we extracted spectra from small $1 \times 27.3$ arcsec boxes in a profile across the filament (the regions we used are shown in Fig. \[fig:filamentregions\]). We created background spectra, responses, ancillary responses, and out of time background spectra for each region.

![Emission measure profiles across the filaments in the different temperature components. The top panel shows an unsharp-masked 0.5-7 keV X-ray image rotated so that the bins lie across it.

The final panels show the best fitting absorbing Hydrogen column density and the metallicity of thermal components.[]{data-label="fig:filamentmulti"}](fig16.jpg.eps){width="\columnwidth"}

Multiphase model
----------------

Our first model was to fit the spectra with a multiphase model consisting of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">apec</span> thermal components at fixed temperatures of 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 keV. The normalisations were allowed to vary and the metallicities of each of the components were tied together. They were absorbed with a <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">phabs</span> photoelectric absorber which was allowed to vary. We assume each component has the same metallicity as we cannot measure them independently. The measurement is likely to be driven by the cooler components as they are line-dominated. The model is similar to that used to produce figure 12 in [@FabianPer06], mapping the multiphase gas. We show the emission measure of each temperature component in Fig. \[fig:filamentmulti\], with the absorbing column

Proof of Theorem \[mainth2\]
----------------------------

Let us turn to implementing the proof of Theorem \[mainth2\]. The basic process to prove it is the same of which we made use in the case of Theorem \[mainth1\]. Hence, in the following, we omit some middle steps which are already written down in the previous subsection.

Firstly, as for the path from to , we take Ramanujan’s summation formula to re-xpress the left-hand side of as $$\begin{aligned}
 \label{proof3} &
\frac{1}{2}

{}_1\psi_1 \left( \alpha \beta; \frac{\gamma}{\alpha}; q, \frac{\gamma w}{\alpha q^{1/2}} \right)
-

{}_1\psi_1 \left( \frac{1}{\beta}; \beta^2 \gamma; q, \frac{\gamma w}{\alpha q^{1/2}} \right)
\right\} \notag \\ &=
\frac{1}{2}
\frac{\left( \frac{\gamma}{\alpha^2 \beta}; q^2 \right)_\infty}{\left( \alpha^2 \beta^2; q^2 \right)_\infty}

\frac{\left( q, q; q^2 \right)_\infty}{\left( \frac{\gamma w}{\alpha q^{1/2}}, \frac{q^{1/2}}{\alpha \beta w}; q^2 \right)_\infty} \notag \\ &\hspace{1em} \times

The weak rigidty in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ can be similarly defined as the weak rigidity in [@park2017rigidity]. Consider formations in [Fig. ]{}\[Fig:ExTetrahedron\]. The first formation is defined by 3 edge lengths and 3 subtended angles while the second formation is defined by 6 edge lengths. The first formation can be transformed to the second formation with the law of cosines as stated in Section \[Sec:weakRigidity\].

\[Def:weakRigidity\] A framework $(\mathcal{G},{\mathbf}{p})$ is [weakly rigid]{} in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ if there exists a neighborhood $\mathcal{B}_{{\mathbf}{p}} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{3n}$ of ${\mathbf}{p}$ such that each framework $(\mathcal{G},{\mathbf}{q})$, ${\mathbf}{q} \in \mathcal{B}_{{\mathbf}{p}}$, strongly equivalent to $(\mathcal{G},{\mathbf}{p})$ is congruent to $(\mathcal{G},{\mathbf}{p})$.

We examine weak rigidity from rigidity matrix. First, the [rigidity function]{} $F_D: \mathbb{R}^{dn} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{m}$ of $(\mathcal{G},{\mathbf}{p})$ is defined as $$F_D({\mathbf}{p})\equiv[...,\norm{{\mathbf}{p}_{ij}}^2,...]^\top_{(i,j) \in \mathcal{E}} \in 
\mathbb{R}^{m}.$$ The [rigidity matrix]{} then is defined as the Jacobian of the rigidity function: $$\label{rigidity_D_matrix}
R_D({\mathbf}{p})=\frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial F_D({\mathbf}{p})}{\partial {\mathbf}{p}} \in 
\mathbb{R}^{m \times dn}.$$

\[Lemma:rankConditionForIR\] A framework $(\mathcal{G},{\mathbf}{p})$ in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with $n \ge 3$ is infinitesimally rigid in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ if and only if the rank of the rigidity matrix of $(\mathcal{G},{\mathbf}{p})$ is $3n - 6$.

Consider a graph $\bar{\mathcal{G}}$, $\bar{\mathcal{G}} = (\bar{\mathcal{V}},\bar{\mathcal{E}},\bar{\mathcal{A}})$, induced from $\mathcal

Eqs. (\[wtq\],\[wtg\]) are the main results of our paper. They are derived from the angular momentum density in QCD with the Lorentz symmetry argument for the transverse polarization decomposition for nucleon state. They provide an intuitive picture for the nucleon transverse polarization from the quarks and gluons.

Comparing with Leader’s transverse spin sum rule derived recently [@Leader:2011cr], we found that his result is frame dependent. As we discussed before, this frame dependence arises from the non-commutativity of the transverse AM and longitudinal boost. Therefore, a frame-independent parton picture does not exist for the transverse AM but rather the Pauli-Lubanski spin vector. Comparing with Burkardt’s result [@Burkardt:2005hp], our derivation here dispenses with the wave-packet construction and is valid for any residual momentum of the nucleon in IMF, not just the rest frame.

Summary
=======

In conclusion, we have examined the transverse spin structure for the nucleon by a detailed study of the angular momentum density tensor. By constructing transverse polarization through the Lorentz-covariant Pauli-Lubanski vector, we derived a sum rule that satisfies the boost invariance, and is consistent with the GPD spin sum rule derived early. We find that the leading contribution to the the transverse AM has a simple partonic AM density interpretation.

2.  find the constants of motion from equation (\[const\]),

3.  solve equation (\[int\]) for $i$ (initial sign of $\Re$ in equation (\[int\]) is negative for $\pi/2 < \phi_e < 3\pi/2$ and positive otherwise),

4.  find $g_{\rm eff}$ from equation (\[g\]),

5.  increment an element of the transfer function table corresponding to $a$, $r_e$, $\cos i$, $g_{\rm eff}$ and $\cos \theta_e$.

In order to compute and tabulate the transfer function we have calculated trajectories of $10^9$ photons. The disc is axially symmetric and emission from a given point of the disc is also axially symmetric. Therefore, integration over $\phi_e$ for trajectories starting at a given point of the disc and observed at a given angle $i$ and collected at all angles $\phi_o$ is equivalent to integration over all trajectories starting at a given radius $r_e$, which are observed at a given angle $i$ and any particular $\phi_o$.

Transformation of the photon number intensity {#app:intensity_transformation}
=============================================

As pointed out in Section \[sec:model\], application of the photon transfer function requires transformation of the photon number intensity between the reference frames of the distant observer (the Boyer-Lindquist coordinate frame) and the observer co-rotating with the disc. The latter one is represented by the covariant tetrad (we show only the components used below): $$\begin{aligned}

20 news headlines were created in the format of Twitter, consisting of a picture, source, header, and a short description (see Figure \[fig:design\]). 10 verified fake news headlines, and 10 verified real news headlines were chosen from “politifact.com”, which is a well-known third-party fact-checking website. Proposed machine learning warning is attached to the bottom of the fake news. Figure \[fig:design\] gives a depiction of the warning design.

The selected news were released from January to March in 2019, and the topic of news was limited to politics because political news is one type of the most popular news that most individuals read every day, so most of the people have the certain sense to judge its credibility without professional knowledge.

![Warning sign design. A piece of fake news is at the top. A warning sign which indicates that the above news is disputed by a machine learning algorithm is at the bottom.[]{data-label="fig:design"}](design.png){width="45.00000%"}

### Procedure

Participants completed a demographic questionnaire that asked for age, gender. Then we asked participants completed additional questions about their social media experience, interest in politics, factors that impact their decisions.

20 news headlines with and without warnings were shown to a participant along with the questions, respectively. 20 news were presented one at a time in a randomized order. The participants were asked to judge the accuracy and decide their willingness to share the news on a 5-point Likert scale, respectively (1 means “Very inaccurate” or “I would never share news like this one”, 5 means “Very accurate” or “I would love to share news like this one”). Each participant was compensated for \$0.5 for the completion of the task.

### Measures

Among the 100 MTurk workers, there were 68 male, 30 female. 2 people chose not to disclose. Participants came from different age groups, with 18.0% between 18 to 25 years, 35.0% between 26 to 30 years, 20.0% between 31 to 35 years, 11.0% between 36 to 45 years, 11.0% between 46 to 55 years and 5.0% above 55 years.

The social media experience was ranked into five degrees from 1 to 5 based on the frequency of browsing the web in a week: “Extremely likely (Everyday)”, “Very likely (Several times a week)”, “Moderately likely (Once

\[obs1.2\] Every $p$-dominating set of a graph contains all vertices of degree at most $p-1$.

Clearly, addition of some extra edges to a graph could result in decrease of its domination number. In 1990, Kok and Mynhardt [@km90] first investigated this problem and proposed the concept of the reinforcement number. The [*reinforcement number*]{} $r(G)$ of a graph $G$ is defined as the smallest number of edges whose addition to $G$ results in a graph $G'$ with $\g(G')<\g(G)$. By convention $r(G)=0$ if $\g(G)=1$.

The reinforcement number has received much research attention (see, for example, [@bgh08; @dhtv98; @hwx09]), and its many variations have also been well described and studied in graph theory, including total reinforcement [@hrr11; @ses07], independence reinforcement [@zls03], fractional reinforcement [@csm03; @dl97] and so on. In particular, Blair [*et al.*]{} [@bgh08], Hu and Xu [@hx10], independently, showed that the problem determining $r(G)$ for a general graph $G$ is NP-hard.

Motivated by the work of Kok and Mynhardt [@km90], in this paper, we introduce the $p$-reinforcement number, which is a natural extension of the reinforcement number. The [*$p$-reinforcement number*]{} $r_p(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the smallest number of edges of $G^c$ that have to be added to $G$ in order to reduce $\gamma_p(G)$, that is $$r_p(G)=\min\{|B|: B\subseteq E(G^c)\  {\rm with}\ \g_p(G+B)< \g_p(G)\}.$$

It is clear that $r_1(G)=r(G)$. By Observation \[obs1.1\], we can also make a convention, $r_p(G)=0$ if $\g_p(G)\leq p$. Thus $r_p(G)$ is well-defined for any graph $G$ and integer $p\geq 1$. In this paper, we always assume $\g_p(G)> p$ when we consider the $p

\[lem32\] Suppose that Assumptions \[con1\]–\[con3\] hold. Let $\{s_{n}\}$ and $ \{y_{n} \}$ be two sequences formulated by Algorithm \[alg1\]. If there exists a subsequence $\{s_{n_{k}}\}$ convergent weakly to $z \in H$ and $\lim _{k \rightarrow \infty}\|s_{n_{k}}-y_{n_{k}}\|=0$, then $z \in \mathrm{VI}(C, \mathcal{A})$.

From the property of projection and $ y_{n}=P_{C}\left(s_{n}-\gamma_{n} \mathcal{A} s_{n}\right) $, we have $$\langle s_{n_{k}}-\gamma_{n_{k}} \mathcal{A} s_{n_{k}}-y_{n_{k}}, x-y_{n_{k}}\rangle \leq 0, \quad \forall x \in C\,,$$ which can be written as follows $$\frac{1}{\gamma_{n_{k}}}\langle s_{n_{k}}-y_{n_{k}}, x-y_{n_{k}}\rangle \leq\langle \mathcal{A} s_{n_{k}}, x-y_{n_{k}}\rangle, \quad \forall x \in C\,.$$ Through a direct calculation, we get $$\label{aw}
\frac{1}{\gamma_{n_{k}}}\langle s_{n_{k}}-y_{n_{k}}, x-y_{n_{k}}\rangle+\langle \mathcal{A} s_{n_{k}}, y_{n_{k}}-s_{n_{k}}\rangle \leq\langle \mathcal{A} s_{n_{k}}, x-s_{n_{k}}\rangle,\quad  \forall x \in C\,.$$ We have that $\{s_{n_{k}}\}$ is bounded since $\{s_{n_{k}}\}$ is convergent weakly to $z \in H$. Then, from the Lipschitz continuity of $\mathcal{A}$ and $\|s_{n_{k}}-y_{n_{k}}\| \rightarrow 0$, we obtain that $\{\mathcal{A} s_{n_{k}}\}$ and $\{y_{n_{k}}\}$ are also bounded. Since $\gamma_{n_{k}} \geq \min \{\gamma_{1}, \frac{\phi}{L}\}$, one concludes from that $$\label{po}


Finally, we note that several other effects that tend to reduce the discrepancy have been reported. The influence of charge symmetry breaking, arising from the mass difference between up and down quarks[@csb], accounts for about a third to a half of the deviation between NuTeV’s value of ${\mbox{$\sin^2\theta_W$}}$ and that of the Standard Model in a model-independent manner[@ncsb] . Furthermore, it has been known for more than 20 years that parton distributions of nucleons bound in nuclear matter differ from those of free nucleons. Such effects[@emc] still present a considerable challenge to our understanding of nonperturbative QCD and it is not inconceivable that they could eventually account for the entire deviation of ${\mbox{$\sin^2\theta_W$}}$.

It seems clear that the extraction of the the value of ${\mbox{$\sin^2\theta_W$}}$ from neutrino-nuclear interactions involves handling several different types of corrections of different signs, including some that are difficult evaluate with precision. The situation here may well be similar to many in strong interaction physics, in which a “cocktail” of effects is required[@taubes]. Considering that possible explanations in terms of new physics are not compelling[@Davidson:2002fb], considerable efforts must be applied before concluding that the NuTeV result really demonstrates a deficiency of the Standard Model.

Since we ignore the inertia of the fluid, the force balance equation is given by $$\partial_\beta\sigma_{\alpha\beta}=0,\label{fb}$$ with $\sigma_\mathrm{\alpha\beta}=-p\delta_{\alpha\beta}+\sigma^v_{\alpha\beta}$. The pressure $p$ is the pressure arising from the incompressibility condition $\bm{\nabla}\cdot \textbf{v}=0$. We have disregarded the Ericksen stress $\sigma^\mathrm{e}_{\alpha\beta}=\mathcal{F}\delta_{\alpha\beta}-\partial{\mathcal F}/\partial(\partial_\beta Q_{\mu\nu})\partial_\alpha Q_{\mu\nu}$ [@DeGennes1969; @JulicherGrillSalbreaux2018] since it is at least quadratic order in $Q_{\alpha\beta}$. Then, using the incompressibility condition $\bm{\nabla}\cdot \textbf{v}=0$, the linearized Eq.  can be simplified to $$\eta_\mathrm{eff}\nabla^2\textbf{v}-\bm{\nabla}p=0.\label{Stokes}$$ The incompressibility condition is imposed by representing $\textbf{v}$ as the curl of a stream function $\bm{\psi}$ i.e. $\textbf{v}=\bm{\nabla}\times\bm{\psi}$. For simplicity, we choose the form of $\bm{\psi}$ such that $\bm{\nabla}\cdot\bm{\psi}=0$. Taking the curl of Eq. yields $$\nabla^4\bm{\psi}=0,\label{fb3}$$ where $\nabla^4$ is the square of the Laplacian operator in three dimensions. We solve the above equation with the boundary conditions appropriate to the geometry at hand and calculate the forces on the interface due to the fluid.

To describe the force per unit area acting on at the surface, we need to parametrize the surface as $\mathbf{X}(u^1,u^2)$, with coordinates $u^1$ and $u^2$. Due to the free energy associated with the surface \[see Eq. \], the force per unit area acting on the surface is given by [@Powers2010] $${\mathbf f}_m=2\gamma H\mathbf{n},$$ where $\mathbf{n}$ is the outward normal. Note that our convention is that $H$ is negative for a sphere or a cylinder. Since we disregard the inertia of the surface, the force

How far is Young’s inequality from the Legendre duality? Surprisingly, they are pretty closed in the sense that in most cases the Legendre duality can be converted into a Young like inequality. Indeed, every continuous convex function admits an integral representation.

\[Lem2\]*(*See *[@NP2006]*, page *37)*. Let $F$ be a continuous convex function defined on an interval $I$ and let $\varphi:I\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be a function such that $\varphi
(x)\in\partial F(x)$ for every $x\in\,I.$ Then for every $a<b$ in $I$ we have $$F(b)-F(a)=\int_{a}^{b}\,\varphi(t)\,dt.$$

As a consequence, the heuristic meaning of the formula $i)$ in Lemma \[Lem1\] is the following Young like inequality, $$ab\leq\int_{a_{0}}^{a}\varphi\left(  x\right)  dx+\int_{b_{0}}^{b}\psi\left(
y\right)  dy\text{\quad for all }a\in I,\ b\in I^{\ast},$$ where $\varphi$ and $\psi$ are selection functions for $\partial F$ and respectively $\left(  \partial F\right)  ^{-1}$. Now it becomes clear that Young’s inequality should work outside strict monotonicity (as well as outside continuity). The details are presented in Section 2. Our approach (based on the geometric meaning of integrals as areas) allows us to extend the framework of integrability to all positive measures $\rho$ which are locally absolutely continuous with respect to the planar Lebesgue measure $dxdy$. See Theorem \[ThmYoungNondecr\] below.

A special case of Young’s inequality is$$xy\leq\frac{x^{p}}{p}+\frac{y^{q}}{q},$$ which works for all $x,y\geq0

We next consider the energy conservation equation Eq. (\[eq.energy\_density\]). From the endoreversibility condition Eqs. (\[eq.endo\_1\]) and (\[eq.endo\_2\]) and Eq. (\[eq.fluid\_vel\]), Eq. (\[eq.energy\_density\]) becomes $$\begin{aligned}
\frac{Nk_{\rm B}}{V}\frac{dT}{dt}=-\nabla \cdot {\bm J}-\frac{Nk_{\rm B}T}{Vl} \frac{dl}{dt}.\label{eq.energy_2}\end{aligned}$$ By performing a spatial integral on both sides of this equation, we obtain $$\begin{aligned}
Nk_{\rm B}\frac{dT}{dt}=q-p\frac{dV}{dt},\label{eq.1st_law_fluid}\end{aligned}$$ where we defined $q\equiv \int_0^L J_x(0,y,t)dy$ and used $J_y(x,0,t)=J_y(x,L,t)=J_x(l,y,t)=0$ except at the thermal wall of the cylinder. Equation (\[eq.1st\_law\_fluid\]) corresponds to the first law of thermodynamics Eq. (\[eq.1st\_law\_deriv\]), where the detailed form of $q$ has been determined by the molecular kinetics.

In several models of RP and SAP the estimates of $N_K$ for different knots are given by almost the same value as far as investigated. We therefore call it the characteristic length of the knotting probability[@JKTR], and denote it by $N_0$. For the cylindrical SAP the $N_K$s are evaluated as the same for 145 knots with respect to errors [@UD2015].

For a composite knot consisting of knots $K_1$ and $K_2$, denoted by $K_1 \# K_2$, its exponent and coefficient are approximately equal to the sum and the product of those of knots $K_1$ and $K_2$, respectively, in several models of RP and SAP. We call such properties factorization properties of exponents and coefficients, respectively. It was suggested that the factorization properties are derived from the local knot conjecture that the knotted region in a knotted SAP is localized [@Orlandini1998; @Katritch00; @Marcone].

In the present paper we shall show that coefficients $C_K$ for almost all the prime knots are well approximated by exponentially decaying functions of radius $r_{\rm ex}$ in the cylindrical SAP model. We show it numerically for the prime knots with less than or equal to seven minimal crossings. Quite interestingly, only for the trefoil knot the coefficient $C_{3_1}$ increases with respect to radius $r_{\rm ex}$. It follows that the majority of nontrivial knots are given by the trefoil knot and its composite knots if radius $r_{\rm ex}$ is rather large such as $r_{\rm ex}=0.1$.

The knot coefficients $C_K$ have an interesting property that the sum of the knot coefficients over all prime knots is given by 1. We call it the sum rule of knot coefficients for prime knots. We shall show that it is consistent with the formula of the knotting probability. We derive an infinite number of sum rules such that the sum of the knot coefficients over all composite knots consisting of $n$ prime knots is given by $1/n!$ for positive integers $n$. We shall show in section 5 that they are derived from the factorization properties of exponents and coefficients. Furthermore, we suggest that the sum rules give a numerical support for the local knot conjecture.

In order to investigate how far the asymptotic behavior is important in the knotting probability as a function of segment number $N$ we apply the three-parameter

Effect of Phase Noise on Chu Codes:
-----------------------------------

The phase noise of the system is a major limiting factor for the dynamic range of $P_{1}/P_{2}$, where parameters of both the strong and the weak trip, can be recovered, using a inter-pulse Chu code. Phase noise leads to broadening of spectrum. The overall phase noise is dominated by the phase noise of the basic oscillator, from which all the other clocks are derived. Single-side band phase noise is usually measured in a 1 Hz bandwidth, and is defined as the carrier power at an offset with respect to the power measured at 1 Hz Bandwidth. More precisely, phase noise can be defined as the ratio of noise in a 1 Hz Bandwidth to the signal power at the center frequency.

The equivalent noise jitter can be obtained by integrating the phase noise curve over the receiver bandwidth. It is equivalent to:

$$\text{RMS Phase Jitter (in radians)} = \sqrt{2 \times 10^{A/10}}$$

where $A$ is the area under the phase noise curve.

It has been shown in [@Zrnic1999] that, if there is no phase noise and Hann window function is used, the limit on retrieval of velocity is about 90dB for $P_{1}/P_{2}$ ratio, for spectral width less than 4 m/s. But it drastically reduces to 60dB, if rms jitter is of the order of 0.2 deg rms, and further reduces to 40dB in case of 0.5 deg rms phase jitter. This has been confirmed through our simulation also, that the accuracy of the velocity retrieval drastically reduces, under phase noise conditions. The dynamic range of $P_{1}/P_{2}$, in which the weaker trip velocity can be recovered, with and without phase noise, is shown in figures \[fig\_WOPN\] and \[fig\_WPN\] respectively.

Results {#sec:3}
=======

The most important result that we extract is that the Catalan-Spanish system of coexisting languages tends, under most circumstances analyzed, to a stable state in which both languages coexist. The data also reveals a few counterintuitive insights that we examine in the next subsections. The discussion concerns mainly the parameters $k$ and $s$ extracted from adjusting the model equations to the different datasets. We can always track down the stability of the system to these two parameters and the initial conditions. The other parameters in equations ($a$ and $c$) are not so determinant regarding the stability. Their trends as a function of the bilingualism threshold are discussed in the Supporting Material.

Stability of the Catalan-Spanish system
---------------------------------------

The most relevant parameters of the model are the interlinguistic similarity ($k$) and prestige ($s$) which have intuitive interpretations owing to their roles in equations . Thanks to previous studies of the model [@MiraNieto2011; @OteroMira2013; @ColucciOtero2014] we know how to link these parameters to the stability of the system. Figs. \[fig:02\][**a-d**]{} show how the $k-s$ plane is divided into two regions: a gray area where coexistence is possible (depending on the intial conditions) and a white area where coexistence is never possible. For these plots, $a = 1.31$ (a value inherited from the original Abrams-Strogatz studies [@AbramsStrogatz2003]). For other values of $a \le 1$ a similar division of the plane happens[@OteroMira2013], and values of $(k, s)$ exist for which the dynamics are equally well explained. We could have chosen any arbitrary value $a > 1$ without losing explanatory power. Comparisons between $(k, s)$ values only make sense if $a$ is fixed. Hence, to better illustrate the results, we performed our analyses both allowing $a$ to vary and keeping it fixed at $a = 1.31$. Similar conclusions are reached in both cases (see Supplementary Information), but we focus on the fixed case now.

![image](./fig3.pdf){width="\linewidth"}

For each data set and each bilingualism threshold we derived several collections of parameters compatible with the corresponding time

Applying Lemma \[partfrac\], we see that $$\begin{gathered}
    q_{k}(x-w;y+w;z_{1},\ldots,z_{k})
    =\dfrac{y+w}{x+y}\thinspace p_{k+1}(x+y,z_{1},\ldots,z_{k})\\
    -p_{k+2}(y+w,z_{1},\ldots,z_{k},1-x-y-z_{1}-\cdots-z_{k}).\end{gathered}$$ The first term is linear in $w$. The latter expands to $$-\dfrac{(y+w)z_{1}z_{2}\cdots 
    z_{k}(1-x-y-z_{1}-\cdots-z_{k})}{(1-y-w)(1-y-w-z_{1})\cdots(1-y-w-z_{1}-\cdots-z_{k})}.$$ Thus it suffices to show that $$\label{gk}\hypertarget{gk}
    g_{k}(w)=\dfrac{y+w}{(1-y-w)(1-y-w-z_{1})\cdots(1-y-w-z_{1}-\cdots-z_{k})}$$ has positive second derivative. Observe that, for the range of relevant wagers, $-(1-\min\{x,y\})\le w\le (1-\min\{x,y\})$, $1/(1-y-w-z_{1}-\cdots-z_{j})$ satisfies the conditions of Lemma \[prodrule\], as does $$g_{0}(w)=\dfrac{y+w}{1-y-w}=\dfrac1{1-y-w}-1.$$ By induction, $g_{k}>0$, $g'_{k}>0$, $g''_{k}>0$ for all $k$.

Therefore, $q_{k}(x-w;y+w;z_{1},\ldots,z_{k})$ is concave down and by convexity, $$E[q_{k}(x-w;y+w;z_{1},\ldots,z_{k})]<q_{k}(x;y;z_{1},\ldots,z_{k}),$$ completing the proof of Theorem \[main\].

Theorem \[main\] is false for fair wagers among three

The $\beta$-decay experiments st the TRI$\mu$P facility will be carried out using a set of two subsequent magneto optical traps. The first trap is to collect atoms and bunch them toward the second trap inside a detection chamber. The first trap is made of a small glass cavity and has wide laser beams for efficient collection of atoms. It will contain a hot Yttrium foil to neutralize the incoming ion beam. The second trap is located in a precision measurement chamber centering a reaction microscope and $\beta$-electron counter.

Beta decay spectroscopy
=======================

Correlations between particles from $\beta$-decay manifest the symmetries and symmetry violations of the weak interaction [@WI05; @SE05]. In weak interactions (a current-current interaction) several currents can contribute. these are Scalar(S), Vector (V), Axial-vector (A) and Tensor (T) currents. In the Standard Model (SM), the weak interaction is exclusively the result of V and A currents. The V current is observed in Fermi (F) decay and the A current in Gamow-Teller (GT) decay. Contribution of other currents in $\beta$-decay will affect the correlations between the particles and their kinematics. Deviations from the standard V-A model indicates physics beyond the SM.

![RIMS sketch[]{data-label="fig:RIMS"}](RIMS4.ps)

It is not practical to measure the $\nu$ particle in $\beta-\nu$ correlations. Therefore, one measures the correlation between the $\beta$-electron and recoil ion in order to measure the complete phase-space of the $\beta$-decay. Recoil-Ion-Momentum Spectroscopy (RIMS) is an advanced method to measure the recoil ion. This method is used at KVI to study charge exchange process with the recoil energy in order of eV [@TU01; @KN05]. In RIMS the recoil ions are projected with an electric field on a position sensitive microchanel plate detector (MCP)(Fig. \[fig:RIMS\]). This method has been used successfully by other groups for $\beta$-decay studies [@SC04; @GO00].

The time of flight measurement of the recoil ion is started by observing a hit in the $\beta$-detector and is stopped by the hit on the MCP. Together with the position of the recoil ion

Protocol
========

In this section we give a brief explanation on the simplest version of the protocols for Alice to send Bob one-bit message (or secret key). Bob first prepares a maximally entangled state $|\phi_0\rangle :=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|11\rangle +|00\rangle)$. He sends one of the bipartite systems which is called system A. It is described by a Hilbert space ${\cal H}_A (\simeq {\bf C}^2)$. Another system possessed by Bob is called system B with its Hilbert space ${\cal H}_B (\simeq {\bf C}^2)$. Bob confirms Alice’s receipt of the system A [@confirm]. Alice randomly chooses one from $\{\mbox{Control},\ \mbox{Message}\}$. If she chose “Control", she lets Bob know it and they both make measurements of $\sigma_z(A)$ and $\sigma_z(B)$ on their own systems respectively [@sigma]. If their outcomes disagree, they know existence of Eve and abort the protocol. On the other hand, if Alice chose “Message", she encodes her one-bit message to her system A. She does nothing on system A for the message $0$. She operates $\sigma_z(A)$ on it for the message $1$, which changes the phase with respect to $|0\rangle$. Alice sends back the system A to Bob. Bob makes a Bell measurement on the composite system A and B to know the encoded message. As pointed out in [@QCai03; @BF08], this naive protocol yields a simple “attack" that disturbs the message without being detected. That is, just an attack only on the second quantum communication from Alice to Bob does not affect the error probability in the control mode but can change the message while Eve cannot obtain any information. As claimed in [@QCai03; @BF08], this disadvantage may be avoided by introducing authentication phase after the protocol or slightly modifying the protocol itself. We, however, do not treat this problem here. What we are interested in is whether Eve can distinguish the messages $0$ and $1$ without being detected.

Analysis
========

Let us see what Eve can do in this protocol. Eve prepares her own system E which is described by a Hilbert space ${\cal H}_E$. We write the initial state of system E as $|\Omega\rangle$. She interacts it with system A when system A is sent between Alice and Bob. That is, she has two chances to obtain

Control channels with known branching ratios allow to normalize the signal trough

$$N_S={\epsilon_S\over\epsilon_C}{f _{B,S}BR_S\over f _{B,C}BR_C}N_C \qquad .
\label{normalization}$$

Subindices $S$ and $C$ stand for signal and control channel respectively. The total efficiency $\epsilon$ can be split as $\epsilon_{rec/prod}\times\epsilon_{sel/rec}\times\epsilon_{trig/sel}$, where $\epsilon_{rec/prod}$ is the reconstruction efficiency on produced events, $\epsilon_{sel/rec}$ is the efficiency of the offline selection on reconstructed events, and $\epsilon_{trig/sel}$ is the efficiency of the trigger on offline-selected events. $B^0$ decays are aproppiate for calibration due to the accuracy in the measurements of their branching ratios. A proper choice of the control channel leads to cancellation of the effect of some sources of inefficiency:

-   $B^+\rightarrow J/\Psi (\mu\mu )K^+$. The effect of the trigger is similar to that for the signal due to the $J$/$\Psi$ muons. The ratio of reconstruction efficiencies needs to take into account the different number of tracks in the final state between the signal and the control channel (two and three tracks respectively), and it is estimated through: $${ \epsilon _{rec} (2~tracks) \over \epsilon _{rec} (3~tracks) } \sim { \epsilon _{rec} (3~tracks) \over \epsilon _{rec} (4~tracks) }
    \label{reco}$$ Using $B^0\rightarrow J/\Psi (\mu \mu)K^{*0}(\pi K)$ as the four-track decay channel the ratio between the left-hand side and the right-hand side is 92%.

-   $B\rightarrow h^+h^-$. Has the same kinematic properties to that of signal, leading to cancellation of reconstruction and selection effects.

In both cases the ratio of trigger efficiencies is estimated using events triggered on particles not related with signal, which have a relatively small trigger bias on signal properties. The ratio of $B$ production fractions in Equation \[normalization\] is the main source of uncertainty of the measurement, as long as channels coming from $B^0$ decays are used for normalization. It introduces a systematic error of

Cosmological scalar fields as perfect fluids \[scalar.field\]
=============================================================

We are considering a flat FL universe in which the matter-energy content is a single minimally coupled scalar field $\varphi$. The stress-energy tensor is of the form

$$\label{sfT_ab}
T^a\!_b = \bna^a\varphi\bna\!_b\varphi - \left[{{\textstyle{1\over2}}} \bna^c\varphi\bna\!_c\varphi +
V(\varphi)\right]\delta^a\!_b ,$$

and the conservation equation leads to the Klein-Gordon equation $\bna^c\bna\!_c\varphi - V\!_{,\varphi} = 0$, where the potential $V(\varphi)$ has to be specified. In cosmology this stress-energy tensor has the perfect fluid form $$\label{pf}
T^a\!_b = \left(\rho + p\right)\!u^a u_b + p\delta^a\!_b,$$ with $$\label{T_ab,scalar}
\rho + p = -  \bna^a\varphi \bna\!_a\varphi, \qquad \rho - p = 2V(\varphi),
\qquad u_a = \frac{\bna\!_a\varphi}{\sqrt{- \bna^a\varphi \bna\!_a\varphi}} .$$

Background equations \[background\]
-----------------------------------

In a spatially flat background the Friedmann equation[^26] and the conservation of energy equation read[^27]

\[basic.relations\] $$\label{prop.of.rho}
3H^2 = \rho_0, \qquad \rho_0' = -3(\rho_0+p_0),$$ where $H$ is the background Hubble variable while $\rho_0$ and $p_0$ are the background energy density and pressure, respectively. We introduce the standard matter variables $w=p_0/\rho_0$ and $c_s^2=p_0'/\rho_0'$. Using these equations and the definition $1+q=- H'/H$ it follows that $$\label{prop.of.w}
3(1+w)=2(1+q), \qquad  w'=3(1+w)(w-c_s^2

By applying the two-mode approximation, the time-dependent wave function in Eq. (\[wave-function\]) can be expanded in term of Fock states as $$|\Psi_{\rm BEC}(t)\rangle = \sum_{n=0}^{N} \sqrt{C_{N}^{n}} \alpha^{\ast n}\beta^{\ast N-n}|n,N-n\rangle_{R,L} ,
    \label{two-mode_wave_function}$$ where $C_{N}^{n}$ is the binomial coefficient, and the Fock basis are defined as $$|n,N-n\rangle_{R,L}=\frac{(\psi_{R}^{\dagger})^{n}}{\sqrt{n!}}\frac{(\psi_{L}^{\dagger})^{N-n}}{\sqrt{(N-n)!}}|vac\rangle .
    \label{number_state}$$ The dynamics can be described by defining the field operator $\psi(t)=\alpha(t)\psi_{R}+\beta(t)\psi_{L}$, and considering Heisenberg equation $$i\frac{d\psi(t)}{dt}=\left[ \psi(t), H_{0}+H_{\rm int}+V_{\rm ex} \right],
    \label{Heisenberg}$$ leading to the following equation of motion $$i\frac{d}{dt}\left( 
        \begin{array}{c}
             \alpha(t) \\ \beta(t)
        \end{array}
\right)=H_{\rm eff}\left( 
    \begin{array}{c}
        \alpha(t) \\ \beta(t)
    \end{array}
\right).
    \label{motion}$$ Here, the effective two-mode Hamiltonian is given by $$\begin{aligned}
    H_{\rm eff}&=&E_{k}^{-}+\frac{V_{0}}{2}+G_{1}+V_{p}s_{x}+E_{m}(|\alpha|^{2}-|\beta|^{2})s_{z} \nonumber\\
    &&+2E_{s}\left[ {\rm Re}(\alpha\beta^{\ast})s_{x}-{\rm Im}(\alpha\beta^{\ast})s_{y} \right],
    \label{Heff}\end{aligned}$$ where $s_{x,y,z}$ are spin matrices spanned by the two magnetized states, and $V_{p}=V

2.  $z_a,x_{ia},x_{ib}$ are fixed numbers, for all $i\in\{0,\ldots,n-1\}$,

3.  $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \Box^i x}[x,z]\in  H^\alpha(I^n,\mathbb{C})$, for all $i\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$,

4.  $[x,z](t)=(t,x,\Box x(t),\ldots,\Box^n x(t),z(t))$ and $[x](t)=(t,x,\Box x(t),\ldots,\Box^n x(t))$,

5.  the Lagrangian $L:[a,b]\times\mathbb R^{n+1}\to\mathbb R$ is of class $C^2$.

Then, $(x,z)$ is a solution of the equation $$\lambda(t)\frac{\partial L}{\partial x}[x,z](t)+\sum_{i=1}^n (-1)^i \frac{\Box^{i}}{\Box t^{i}}\left(\lambda(t)\frac{\partial L}{\partial \Box^ix}[x,z](t)\right)=0,$$ for all $t\in[a,b]$.

Let $x(t)+\epsilon \eta(t)$ be a variation function of $x$, with $\epsilon\in\mathbb R$ and $\eta\in H^\beta \cap  C^n_\Box([a,b], \mathbb{R})$ ($\beta\in]0,1[$). Also, assume that the variations fulfill the conditions:

1.  for all $i=0,\ldots,n-1$, $\Box^i \eta(a)= \Box^i \eta(b)=0$, and $\Box^n \eta(a)=0$,

2.  for all $i=1, 2, \ldots, n$ and $k=0, 1,\ldots, i-1$, $$\lim_{h \to 0} \int_a^b\left( \frac{\Box_h}{\Box t}\left(\lambda(t)\frac{\Box^k}{\Box t^k}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \Box^i x}[x,z](t)\right)\Box^{i-k-1} \eta(t

2.  The manifolds in $\calS(\calP)$ share the same cellular 3-skeleton: therefore all their homology groups and the homotopy groups $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ depend only on $\calP$.

3.  If $\calP$ and $\calP'$ are related by Andrew-Curtis moves [@AnCu], then $\calS(\calP) = \calS(\calP')$.

For instance, the trivial (empty) presentation $\calP = \langle\, |\, \rangle$ yields $\calS(\calP) = \{S^4\}$. A balanced presentation (*i.e.* having the same number of generators and relators) of the trivial group always yields a unique homotopy 4-sphere. The Andrew-Curtis conjecture states that every such presentation is related to the trivial one by AC-moves [@AnCu]. If this holds, then such a homotopy 4-sphere is always $S^4$. However, such a conjecture is commonly believed to be false: one way to disprove it could be to constuct a fake $S^4$ in this way.

Consider the standard presentations $$\calC_n = \langle a | a^n \rangle, \quad \calD_{2n} = \langle a,b | a^2, b^2, (ab)^n \rangle$$ of the cyclic and dihedral groups. We classify the manifolds in $\calS(\calC_n)$ and $\calS(\calD_{2n})$ and assign them some names.

\[finite:prop\] We have the following. $$\begin{aligned}
\calS(\calC_n) & = & \left\{\begin{array}{ll} \left\{C_n^0, C_n^1 \right\} & {\rm \ if\ } n {\rm \ is \ even,}\\
\left\{C_n^0\right\} & {\rm \ if\ } n {\rm \ is \ odd.} \end{array}\right. \\
\calS(\calD_{2n}) & = & \left\{\begin{array}{ll} \left\{D_n^0, D_n^1, D_n^2, D_n^3\right\}& {\rm \ if\ } n=2 \\

Derivation of Eq (\[Relation\])
===============================

In order to prove the equation (\[Relation\]), we consider the eigen-equation:

$$(A+I)\textbf{v}=0$$

In the following, we take $R_{1}=R_{2}$. It will be easy to extend to $R_{1}=R_{2}=...=R_{n}$.

$$\begin{pmatrix}
     1 & 1 & \cdots & a_{1,N} \\
     1 & 1 & \cdots & a_{1,N} \\
     \vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
     a_{1,N} & a_{1,N} & \cdots & 1  
  \end{pmatrix}
   \begin{pmatrix}
  v_{1} \\
  v_{2} \\
  \vdots \\
  v_{N}
 \end{pmatrix}
 =0
\label{EQ2}$$

Thanks to the two first rows, we can write:

$$v_{1}+v_{2}+\sum_{i=3}^{N}a_{1i}v_{i}=0
\label{A}$$

By extending to the general case, we obtain:

$$\sum_{i\in K}v_{i}+\sum_{j\in S}v_{j}=0$$

We can note that if **v** is an eigenvector associated to 0 eigenvalue of $A+I$ matrix, **v** will also be an eigenvector associated to 0 eigenvalue of $(A+I)^{2}$, $(A+I)^{3}$, etc. So:

$$(A+I)^{2}\textbf{v}=0$$

$$\begin{pmatrix}
     2+\sum_{i=3}^{N}a_{1i}^{2} & 2+\sum_{i=3}^{N}a_{1i}^{2} & \cdots & 3a_{1N}+\sum_{i=3}^{N-1} a_{1i}a_{iN} \\
     2+\sum_{i=3}^{N}a_{1

We simulate the quantum state transfer (QST) for spin chains with odd $N$ in the weak coupling regime, $g=\kappa / (10\sqrt{N})$, and for a intra-chain spacing. After the transfer the acquired phase $\pm 1$ of the target state is corrected to enable a direct comparison with the initial state (in practice the phase would be cancelled by employing a two-round protocol [@yao12; @markiewicz09; @yao11]). To evaluate the fidelity of the transfer process, we use the measure $F^2(\rho, \sigma) = \text{Tr} \left(\sqrt{\sqrt{\rho} \sigma \sqrt{\rho}} \right)^2$ [@jozsa94]. The N defect spins are subjected to independent physical $T_2$ processes, realised as spin flips in the computational basis.

![Fidelity $F^2$ of the transferred state $\rho$ with respect to the input $\sigma = \ket{+}\bra{+}$, through the $N=3$ chain as a function of the transfer time $\tau$. The initial state is $\ket{+}_0\ket{000}\ket{0}_{N+1}$, and we operate in the weak coupling regime $g=\kappa/(10\sqrt{N})$ for $\kappa = \unit{26}{\kilo\hertz}$. The nitrogen spins experience independent dephasing at a rate $\gamma = 1/T_2$. Whilst the curves seem to coincide in the main plot, the inset shows a zoomed-in view near the maximum on the scale relevant for fault tolerance.[]{data-label="fig:ftqc"}](FigureS2.eps){width="3.4in"}

Fig. \[fig:ftqc\] shows that meeting a fault-tolerance threshold of order $F^2 \geq 99\%$ requires unrealistically long coherence times of the defect spins. More specifically, the shortest non-trivial $N=3$ chain achieves a sufficiently high fidelity only for $T_2 \geq \unit{54}{\milli\second}$ whereas this number increases to $T_2 \geq \unit{88}{\milli\second}$ for $N=5$.

As described in the main text, in the weak coupling regime NV$^-$ center excitations tunnel through the (single) zero-energy mode of the chain, and off-resonant coupling to other modes

Having shown that the flare-out condition $b'(r_0)<1$ has been met, let us return to the violation of the null energy condition (NEC), which states that for the energy-momentum tensor $T_{\alpha\beta}$, $$T_{\alpha\beta}\mu^{\alpha}\mu^{\beta}\ge 0$$ for all null vectors. So given the radial outgoing null vector $(1,1,0,0)$, we have that $\rho(r_0) +p_r(r_0)<0$ whenever the condition is violated. By Ref. [@MT88], this violation is equivalent to the condition $$\frac{b'(r_0)-b(r_0)/r_0}{2[b(r_0)]^2}<0,$$ which holds whenever $b'(r)<1$ at or near the throat. As noted in the Introduction, for a Morris-Thorne wormhole, the violation of the NEC requires the use of “exotic matter," since ordinary matter normally satisfies the NEC. We have seen, however, that the shape functions and subsequent flare-out conditions were obtained from the embedding theory, which may be viewed as part of the induced-matter theory [@pW92] in the following sense: according to Ref. [@pW15], the field equations for the five-dimensional flat embedding space yield the Einstein field equations in four dimensions *containing matter*. The induced-matter theory therefore implies that the matter in our Universe actually comes from geometry and this may very well include exotic matter. So while exotic matter cannot be avoided, it may be less problematical in the present context.

Our final observation concerns asymptotic flatness. Since $\nu(r)\rightarrow
0$ as $r\rightarrow\infty$, we also have $\text{lim}_{r\rightarrow \infty}\nu'(r)=0$. So if $n<1$, we see from Eq. (\[E:shape3\]) that $b(r)/r\rightarrow 0$ (in addition to $e^{\nu(r)}\rightarrow 1$), resulting in an asymptotically flat spacetime.

Unfortunately, this conclusion does not hold for $n>1$. So the wormhole spacetime has to be cut off at some $r=a$ and joined to an external Schwarzschild spacetime $$ds^{2}=-\left(1-\frac{2M}{r}\right)dt^{2}
+\frac{dr^2}{1-

On the other hand, differential forms allows to characterize LL action and those dynamical equations. In order to do this task we introduce the vielbein $e^a$ and the spin connection $\omega^{ab}$ 1-forms. These 1-forms are related to curvature and torsion two-forms as follow $R^{ab}=d\omega^{ab}+\omega^a_c\omega^{cb}$ and $T^a=de^a+\omega^a_be^b$. So, the lagragian can be written as $$\label{accionLL}\
L_{LL}= \int \sum_{q=0}^{[d/2]}\alpha_qL^q~,$$where $\alpha_q$ are arbitrary constants and $$\label{polinomio}\
L^{q}=\epsilon_{a_{1}...a_{d}}R^{a_{1}a_{2}}...R^{a_{2q-1}a_{2q}}e^{a_{2q+1}}...e^{a_{d}}.$$ In generic form the coefficients are arbitrary in the LL action. However, they can be fixed in order to have a unique vacuum or a unique cosmological constant. In this case the coefficient are given by $\alpha_q:=c_{q}^{k}$ where $c_{q}^{k}=\frac{l^{2(q-k)}}{d-2q}(^{k}_{q})$ for $q\leq k$ and vanished for $q>k$, which $1\leq k\leq [\frac{d-1}{2}]$. Then, the action can be written as follows $$\label{accionk}\
I_{k}= \kappa\int \sum_{q=0}^{[k]}c_q^kL^q~.$$This action possesses two fundamentals constants $\kappa$ (related to Newton gravitational constant $G_{k}$) and $l$, (related to cosmological constant $\Lambda$). $$\label{definitionk}\
\kappa=\frac{1}{2(d-2)!\Omega _{d-2}G_{k}}~,$$$$\label{lambda}\
\Lambda=-\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2l^2}~,$$where $\Omega_{d-2}$ is the volume of a $(d-2)$-unit sphere. For $k=1$ the Einstein- Hilbert action is recovered. It is worth nothing that in odd dimensions the

Especially, if there is not a strong magnetic field to polarize the nuclei at very low temperature, the nuclei in the detection material would be randomly oriented, the polar and azimuthal angles would be averaged and the deformation effects should be eventually smeared out.

Therefore, our conclusion is that unless one can keep the detector at very low temperature such as the CDMS detector and apply a strong magnetic field to it, the effects of deformation of nuclei can be safely ignored.

This filled-cage structure is reminiscent of the filled skutterudite antimonides, such as CeFe$_{4}$Sb$_{12}$[@MorelliJAP95] or RE$_{1-y}$Fe$_{4-x}$Co$_{x}$Sb$_{12}$ (RE=La, Ce)[@SalesPRB97], or Sr or Eu doped Ge clathrates,[@CohnPRL99] where the heavy La, Ce, Sr, or Eu dopant atoms fill cages in the host crystal structure. Slack originally proposed that “rattling" movement of the heavy dopant atom in the anharmonic potential of the cage would strongly scatter phonons but not charge carriers, resulting in a material with a high thermoelectric figure of merit.[@SlackCRCchap] Although there is some debate about the detailed mechanism of the phonon scattering,[@FeldmanPRB2000; @CaoPRB04] it is clear that the filled-cage structures in these materials dramatically alter the vibrational spectrum, reducing the thermal conductivity over a wide temperature range (at least $2-300$ K), and increasing the specific heat.[@KeppensNature98; @FeldmanPRB2000; @HermannPRL03]

In this paper we present specific heat and thermal conductivity measurements of gadolinium- and yttrium-doped amorphous silicon thin films from $3-100$ K, as well as high-resolution cross-section transmission-electron microscope (XTEM) observations of the films. We compare these measurements to data on $a$-Si films grown by the same technique and literature values for crystalline silicon to probe the nature of vibrational states and scattering in rare-earth doped amorphous silicon.

Experiment
==========

Thin film $a$-Y$_{x}$Si$_{1-x}$ and $a$-Gd$_{x}$Si$_{1-x}$ samples were e-beam co-evaporated from separate Y, Gd, and Si crucibles onto amorphous Si-N membrane-based microcalorimeters and amorphous Si-N coated Si substrates. The microcalorimeters and substrates were held near room temperature throughout the deposition, promoting the growth of amorphous films. Typical deposition pressures were $\leq 2 \times 10^{-8}$ Torr. The films on substrates were used to measure the film thickness via profilometry, the composition by Rutherford backscattering (RBS), the dangling bond density via ESR, the sound velocity,[@Lee

Large friction behavior of $\mathcal{L}_\gamma^{-1}$ {#sec:proof_L_gamma_large}
----------------------------------------------------

The proof of Lemma \[lem:bounded\_resolvent\_perp\] follows the same lines as the proof of uniform hypocoercive estimates in the corrected version of Theorem 3 in [@JS12] (see the erratum [@JS12erratum] or the updated preprint version [@JS12preprint]). We provide a simplified version of it for completeness.

We show that the operator $\mathcal{L}_\gamma$ is uniformly hypocoercive for $\gamma {\geqslant}1$. The aim is to obtain bounds on the inverse $\mathcal{L}^{-1}_\gamma$ extended to ${\mathcal{H}}^1_\perp$. To this end, we decompose ${\mathcal{L}_\gamma}$ for $\gamma {\geqslant}1$ as $${\mathcal{L}_\gamma}= \mathcal{L}_1 + (\gamma-1) C.$$ The proof of Theorem 6.2 in [@HP08] shows that there exists $\widetilde{\alpha} > 0$ such that, for all $u \in \mathcal{S}$, $$-\left\langle\left\langle u, \mathcal{L}_1 u \right\rangle\right\rangle
{\geqslant}\widetilde{\alpha} \left\langle\left\langle u, u \right\rangle\right\rangle,$$ where the norm induced by $\left\langle\left\langle \cdot, \cdot\right\rangle\right\rangle$ is equivalent to the $H^1(\mu)$ norm. More precisely, $\left\langle\left\langle \cdot, \cdot\right\rangle\right\rangle$ is the bilinear form defined by $$\left\langle\left\langle u, v\right\rangle\right\rangle 
= a\left\langle u, v\right\rangle
+ b \left\langle \nabla_p u,\nabla_pv\right\rangle 
- \langle \nabla_p u, \nabla_q v\rangle 
- \langle \nabla_q u, \nabla_p v\rangle 
+ b\langle \nabla_q u,\nabla_q v\rangle,$$ with appropriate coefficients $a \gg b \gg 1$. It follows that there exists $\alpha > 0$ independent of $\gamma$ such that

$$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq20a}
    \sigma(1\rightarrow 1)=\frac{4\pi(2l+1)}{k^2(\lambda)}\frac{1}{4}\bigg|\frac{\Gamma_F(\lambda)}{\Gamma(\lambda)}(1-e^{2i\eta})+e^{-2i\delta_l}-1\bigg|^2\\  
    \sigma(1\rightarrow 2)= \frac{4\pi(2l+1)}{k^2(\lambda-\omega)}\frac{\Gamma_F(\lambda)\Gamma_L(\lambda)}{\Gamma^2(\lambda)}\sin^2\eta
    \end{aligned}$$

Let as separate in (\[eq20a\]) for elastic scattering the resonant state and write the potential part of scattering cross sections in the form $$\label{eq:22}
\sigma_{pot}=\frac{\pi(2l+1)}{k^2(\lambda)}4sin^2\delta_l$$ The total cross section of elastic scattering we write as: $$\label{eq23}
\sigma^{el}_{tot}=\sigma_{pot}+\sigma^{el}_{res}$$ where $$\sigma^{el}_{res}=\frac{\pi(2l+1)}{k^2(\lambda)}\frac{\Gamma^2_F(\lambda)}{\Gamma^2(\lambda)}\bigg|1-e^{2i\eta}\bigg|^2$$

From expressions (\[eq7\]) and (\[eq:15\]) for the resonant elastic and inelastic cross sections, we obtain:

$$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq25a}
    \sigma^{el}_{res}=\frac{\pi(2l+1)}{4k^2(\lambda)}\frac{\Gamma^2_F(\lambda)}{(\lambda-E_e-\Delta(\lambda))^2+\frac{\Gamma^2(\lambda)}{4}} \\
    \sigma^{inel}_{res}=\frac{\pi(2l+1)}{k^2(\lambda)}\frac{\Gamma_F(\lambda)\Gamma_L(\lambda)}{(\lambda+\omega-E_e-\Delta(\lambda))^2+\frac{\Gamma^2(\lambda)}{4}}
    \end{aligned}$$

We will prove that if $g_i:{\ensuremath{\mathbb{R}}}^2\to{\ensuremath{\mathbb{R}}}_+$ are $L^2$ functions supported in $I_{k_i}\times{\ensuremath{\mathbb{R}}}$, $i=1,2$, and $g:{\ensuremath{\mathbb{R}}}^3\to{\ensuremath{\mathbb{R}}}_+$ is an $L^2$ function supported in $I_k\times{\ensuremath{\mathbb{R}}}\times [-2^j,2^j]$, $j\leq k_1+k_2+k-15$, then $$\label{jj5}

When $\beta=0.2$, we have only unstable solution for $|Q|=0,~0.7Q_c$, while for $|Q|=0.999Q_c$ there exist three solutions two are unstable and one is stable. Finally, for $|Q|>Q_c$, the horizon radius disappears and both stable and unstable solutions exist similar to the above cases. For $\beta=0.6$, the behavior of solutions presented in Figure **5** is similar to the case $\beta=0.6$ for MGCG shown in Figure **2** for $|Q|=0,~0.7Q_c, ~0.999Q_c$, while for $|Q|>Q_c$, only stable solution exists in this case. When $\beta=1$, we have only stable solutions for all values of $|Q|$ as shown in Figure **6**.

Summary
=======

The study of thin-shell wormholes has been the subject of interest due to the presence of exotic matter, which violates the null energy condition. The aim of this study is to construct cylindrical thin-shell wormholes and investigate the stability of these configurations. We have developed cylindrical thin-shell wormholes by joining two identical copies of the cylindrical manifold using cut and paste method. In order to explore the dynamics of thin-shell wormhole, we have applied the Darmois-Israel junction conditions along with MGCG for the description of exotic matter. We have explored the stability of static solutions numerically satisfying the condition $a_0>r_h$, under linear perturbations.

The stability of thin-shell wormhole solutions is examined for different values of parameter $\beta=0.2,~0.6,~1$. It is found that for $\beta=0.2,~0.6$, there always exist stable and unstable solutions except for $\beta=0.6$ and $|Q|=0.999Q_c$, for which only stable static solution exists. Moreover, in both cases the horizon radius decreases with the increase of $|Q|$. When $\beta=1$, we have stable configurations for small values of $B\alpha^{-(1+\beta)}$ with $|Q|<Q_c$ and approaches to the horizon of the manifold, whereas for $|Q|>Q_c$, we have obtained stable as well as unstable solutions like the other cases for $\beta=0.2,~0.6.$

Further, we examine the stability of solutions for the GCG. It

In all tests presented herein, the characteristic length $\ell_c^0$ intrinsic to the lattice mesh is determined by performing the LD and DD tests on several mesh configurations without inclusions. The intrinsic effective width of the FPZ $\ell_{\mathrm{FPZ}}^0$ is also determined *via* direct measurements. These values are shown in the plots of lengths as if the inclusion diameter or the surface fraction is zero.

Key features that may influence the FPZ size
--------------------------------------------

### Material mesostructure

#### Path (*a*)

For concrete materials, it is usual to deem that the characteristic length depends on the aggregate size. Initial investigations with the model have therefore focused on the role of inclusion diameter $d$ on the width [$\ell_{\mathrm{FPZ}}$]{} of the FPZ, while varying $d$ and keeping the positions and the number of inclusions unchanged (variation path (*a*)). The evolution of the FPZ size [$\ell_{\mathrm{FPZ}}$]{} with respect to the size of the inclusions $d$ is shown in . In this plot and those that follow, each point with its error bar (standard deviation) requires five measurements and corresponds to the mean value of five values of [$\ell_{\mathrm{FPZ}}$]{} with five independently random distributions of the position of inclusions in the specimen. The lattice mesh used in the simulations provides a width of the FPZ equals to $2.1$ mm. Besides, the best fits of the variation of the mean value of [$\ell_{\mathrm{FPZ}}$]{} with respect to the inclusion size $d$ for the two- and three-phase materials are shown in the figure as well. It is noted that these fits are calculated only from the mean values of [$\ell_{\mathrm{FPZ}}$]{} in the cases of inclusions are introduced, so the value of [$\ell_{\mathrm{FPZ}}$]{} of the homogeneous material is not taken into consideration in the fits. Also, the displayed fitted lines do not necessary mean that an affine relation is enlightened. It must rather be seen as a

Additional theoretical results under dependence
===============================================

\[thmdepgen\] Assume that the $p$-values across studies are independent, the $p$-values within the primary study are independent, and the set of $p$-values within the follow-up study has property PRDS. If the selection rule used in step 1 of Procedure 3.2 is a valid selection rule, then Procedure 3.2 with parameters $(q_1,q)$ controls the FDR at level $q$ for the family of no replicability null hypotheses $H_{NR,1},\ldots,H_{NR,m}$.

Let us first find an upper bound for the first term of the sum in (A.1). Note that (A.3) is established using the independence of the $p$-values within the primary study only, therefore it holds for any form of dependence among the $p$-values within the follow-up study. In particular, (A.3) holds under the dependency of Theorem \[thmdepgen\], establishing an upper bound for the first term of the sum in (A.1). It follows from Lemma \[lemdepSM\], item 2, that the second term of the sum in (A.1) is bounded by $q_2.$ Thus we obtain: $$FDR\leq \frac{|I_0|q_1}{m}+q_2=\frac{|I_0|q_1}{m}+q-q_1\leq q.$$

\[SMgenthm\] Assume that the $p$-values across studies are independent. Then Procedure 3.2 with parameters $(q_1,q)$ controls the FDR at level $q$ for the family of no replicability null hypotheses $H_{NR,1},\ldots,H_{NR,m}$ if the selection rule used in step 1 of Procedure 3.2 is a valid selection rule, and the expressions in step 2 of Procedure 3.2 are modified as follows:

1.  In the terms $r(q-q_1)/R_1$ and $R_2(q-q_1)/R_1,$ $q-q_1$ is replaced by $(q-q_1)/(\sum_{i=1}^{R_1} 1/i)$, and in the terms $rq_1/m$ and $R_2q_1/m,$ $q_1$ is replaced by $q_1/

Results
=======

We calculate the entanglement entropy for a disk in a lattice of $200$ points. We consider regions of radii $r$ going from $50$ to $80$ in lattice units for the scalar and from $30$ to $50$ for the fermionic field. The sum over the angular momentum $n$ is done exactly up to $n_{max}=3000$ and the corrections coming from contributions $n>n_{max}$ are added by fitting the exact entropy for some large values of $n$. The fit we use is of the form $$s_n=a_2 \frac{1}{n^2}+b_2 \frac{\log n}{n^2}+a_4 \frac{1}{n^4}+b_4 \frac{\log n}{n^4}+a_6 \frac{1}{n^6}+b_6 \frac{\log n}{n^6}$$ since for large $n$ ($n \gg N$) both $C$ and $\sqrt{XP}$ defined in (\[cfe\]), (\[x\]) and (\[p\]) have expansions in even inverse powers of $n$ [@sred].

This is done for different masses in the range $1/20 < m < 1/2$ such that $m^{-1}>\epsilon$ (we fix $\epsilon=1$) and $m r > 1$. For each mass, we fit the entropy in terms of the size $r$ of the disk, $$S=c_1(m)r+c_0(m)+c_{-1}(m)\frac{1}{r}+...\,.$$

Once the coefficients $c_1(m)$ and $c_{-1}(m)$ are identified, we expand in powers of $m$, $$\begin{aligned}
 c_1(m)&=&c_1 m+c^0_1+c^{-1}_1\frac{1}{m}\,,\label{c1m}\\
c_{-1}(m)&=&c^1_{-1} m+c^0_{-1}+c_{-1}\frac{1}{m}\,.\label{c-1m}\end{aligned}$$

We obtain $c_1$ and $c_{-1}$ of (\[expansion\]) as the $m$ and $\frac{1}{m}$ coefficients in (\[c1m\]) and (\[c-1m\]) respectively.

According to the experimental data of XAS, it is not possible that the surface is in pure $\rm Sm^{2+}$ state while the bulk is mixed with $\rm Sm^{2+}$ and $\rm Sm^{3+}$. For Sm metals, which in the bulk is a trivalent of $\rm Sm^{3+}$ at the surface was turned into divalent configuration of $\rm Sm^{2+}$ [@Wertheim1978; @Allen1978; @Johansson1979]. For $\rm SmB_6$, surface valence between 2.5 and 2.6 was determined from X-ray photoemission spectroscopy(XPS)[@Heming2014]. Interestingly, as we calculated the shape of XAS for the surface is more like a $\rm 4f^5$ ground state with $\rm Sm^{3+}$, not a $\rm 4f^6$ ground state with $\rm Sm^{2+}$ (Fig.1). The XMCD results are also puzzling. Indeed, a magnetic TEY signal is observed in the “surface" case ($\rm Sm^{3+}$ like), with the same shape as $\rm Sm^{3+}$ in[@Dhesi2010], whereas no magnetic signal has been detected for the bulk. As the bulk is a $\rm Sm^{2+}$-$\rm Sm^{3+}$ mixing, at least the Sm atoms in the 3+ state should give a magnetic response.

There still remains the problem with the shape of XAS from FY. The intensive peak at higher energy cannot be understood. We doubt there is the energy shift in the FY XAS since the shape canbe well fitted with the XAS of $\rm Sm^{3+}$ and $\rm Sm^{2+}$, as shown in Fig.1. In this case, the XAS and XMCD data canbe well understood and supports their statements very well. However, we have no idea if there exists the energy shift between the XAS from TEY and FY shown in Fig.8a in[@Phelan2014] and needs to be checked by the authors.

We conclude that the XAS and XMCD spectra of Sm in[@Phelan2014] are problematic. Several possible mistakes have been considered to understand the results, among which the energy shift between the XAS from TEY and FY may be the explanation. We also doubt if chemical states of Sm canbe determined from the comparison from the XAS of $\rm

In Fig. \[fig::mqMz\] we show $m_s^{(5)}(M_Z)$ as a function of $\mu_{\rm dec}$ and again compare the single-step (dashed lines) to the two-step (dash-dotted lines) approach. For our numerical analysis we use in addition to the parameters specified above $m_s(2~\mbox{GeV})=100$ MeV. The same conclusion as for $\alpha_s$ can be drawn: The difference between the two approaches becomes smaller with increasing loop order. At the same time the prediction for $m_s^{(5)}(M_Z)$ becomes more and more independent of $\mu_{\rm dec}$. The results again suggest that the power-corrections $M_c/M_b$ are small justifying the application of the two-step decoupling.

Effective coupling of the Higgs boson to gluons {#S:Higgs}
===============================================

The production and decay of an intermediate-mass Higgs boson can be described to good accuracy by an effective Lagrange density where the top quark is integrated out. It contains an effective coupling of the Higgs boson to gluons given by $$\begin{aligned}
  {\cal L}_{\rm eff} &=& -\frac{\phi}{v} C_1 {\cal O}_1 
  \,,
  \label{eq::leff}\end{aligned}$$ with ${\cal O}_1 = G_{\mu\nu} G^{\mu\nu}$. $C_1$ is the coefficient function containing the remnant contributions of the top quark, $G^{\mu\nu}$ is the gluon field strength tensor, $\phi$ denotes the CP-even Higgs boson field and $v$ is the vacuum expectation value.

The effective Lagrange density in Eq. (\[eq::leff\]) can also be used for theories beyond the Standard Model like supersymmetric models or extensions with further generations of heavy quarks. In all cases the effect of the heavy particles is contained in the coefficient function $C_1$.

In Ref. [@Chetyrkin:1997un] a low-energy theorem has been derived which relates the effective Higgs-gluon coupling $C_1$ to the decoupling constant for $\alpha_s$. In this Section we apply this theorem to an extension of the Standard Model containing additional heavy quarks which couple to the Higgs boson via a top quark-like Yukawa coupling. Restating Eq.

Definitions and notation {#SecDN}
------------------------

Let ${\lambda}=({\lambda}_1,{\lambda}_2,\dots)$ be a partition, i.e., ${\lambda}_1\geq {\lambda}_2\geq \dots$ with finitely many ${\lambda}_i$ unequal to zero. The length and weight of ${\lambda}$, denoted by $l({\lambda})$ and ${\lvert{\lambda}\rvert}$, are the number and sum of the nonzero ${\lambda}_i$, respectively. Two partitions that differ only in their string of zeros are identified, and the unique partition of length (and weight) $0$ is itself denoted by $0$. The multiplicity of the part $i$ in the partition ${\lambda}$ is denoted by $m_i=m_i({\lambda})$, and occasionally we will write ${\lambda}=(1^{m_1} 2^{m_2} \dots)$.

We identify a partition with its diagram or Ferrers graph, defined by the set of points in $(i,j)\in {\mathbb Z}^2$ such that $1\leq j\leq {\lambda}_i$. The conjugate ${\lambda}'$ of ${\lambda}$ is the partition obtained by reflecting the diagram of ${\lambda}$ in the main diagonal, so that, in particular, $m_i({\lambda})={\lambda}_i'-{\lambda}_{i+1}'$. The statistic $n({\lambda})$ is given by $$n({\lambda})=\sum_{i\geq 1} (i-1){\lambda}_i=
\sum_{i\geq 1}\binom{{\lambda}_i'}{2}.$$

The dominance partial order on the set of partitions of $N$ is defined by ${\lambda}\geq \mu$ if ${\lambda}_1+\cdots+{\lambda}_i\geq \mu_1+\cdots+\mu_i$ for all $i\geq 1$. If ${\lambda}\geq \mu$ and ${\lambda}\neq\mu$ then ${\lambda}>\mu$.

If ${\lambda}$ and $\mu$ are partitions then $\mu\subseteq{\lambda}$ if (the diagram of) $\mu$ is contained in (the diagram of) ${\lambda}$, i.e., $\mu_i\leq{\lambda}_i$ for all $i\geq 1$.

For $s=(i,j)\in\lambda$ the integers $a(s)$, $a'(s)$, $

In this paper, we propose a new cost and spectrally efficient solution for wireless communication. Consider an urban city environment as shown in Fig. \[fig:model\] with existing deployments of AM, FM, TV, and cellular base stations. These base stations have been setup with tremendous infrastructure cost, undergo periodic maintenance and pay licensing fees to transmit at pre-assigned licensed frequencies. The base stations are designed and geographically located for optimal signal coverage. For example, a typical FM tower can be received up to 100 kms.

We introduce Wireless Quantization Index Modulation (QIM), a communication technique which leverages existing infrastructure and reuses broadcast signals to provide additional communication channels for IoT devices. To understand Wireless QIM, without the loss of generality, let’s consider a broadcast TV station. A TV transmitter can use the QIM technique in its baseband to embed a message into the broadcast TV signal by introducing small perturbations while having a negligible impact on the broadcasted TV signal. Legacy TV receivers in the coverage area decode the broadcasted signal as before while IoT devices with a QIM receiver can decode the embedded message without any prior knowledge of the broadcast signal. So, in summary with a small modification to the baseband of the broadcast station, Wireless QIM reuses infrastructure, spectrum and broadcast signals to simultaneously communicate with QIM enabled IoT devices and legacy AM/FM/TV/cellular devices.

Wireless communication requires both uplink and downlink. However, more often than not, it’s asymmetric i.e. depending on the application, either uplink or downlink communication dominates. In this paper, we focus on downlink heavy applications and design a Wireless QIM system for downlink communication. Our target application is a smart city where using Wireless QIM, existing wireless infrastructure provides connectivity for real-time update of electronic bus schedule displays, billboard signs and advertisements, traffic alerts to name a few. With a minimal change in the baseband of existing broadcast towers, we can embed data to wirelessly update devices with a QIM receiver in real-time. These applications would require a minimal uplink channel to send acknowledgement messages, however such a low bandwidth and infrequent task can be accomplished using traditional LoRa, SigFox or cellular radios for the time being. In future work, we will extend the Wireless QIM technique to uplink communication and develop a bi-directional communication system which can leverage existing infrastructure and communicate with smart devices with zero spectrum overhead and minimal additional

To determine the dynamics of the system over one period of length $T$, we combine the free motion with the dissipative kicks:

1.  during the motion of the particle from $t=0^{+}$ to just before the first kick at time $t=T$, its phase-space coordinates are given by $$\mathbf{z}(t)=\begin{pmatrix}p_{0}\\
    q_{0}+p_{0}t/m
    \end{pmatrix}\equiv\mathbf{F}(t)\text{\ensuremath{\cdot}}\mathbf{z}_{0}\,,\qquad\mathbf{F}(t)=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\
    t/m & 1
    \end{pmatrix}\,,\qquad t\in(0^{+},T^{-})\,,\label{eq: free motion}$$ where $q\in(0,\infty)$ due to the unfolding;

2.  the dissipative kick at time $T$ reduces the momentum of the particle by the factor $\gamma\in(0,1)$, $$\mathbf{z}(T^{+})=\begin{pmatrix}\gamma p(T^{-})\\
    q(T^{-})
    \end{pmatrix}\mathbf{\equiv D}\cdot\mathbf{z}(T^{-})\,,\qquad\mathbf{D}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
    \gamma\  & 0\\
    0 & 1
    \end{array}\right)\,,\qquad t\in(T^{-},T^{+}).\label{eq: first kick}$$

To obtain the *actual* position and momentum of the particle inside the box at time $t$, we map (or “fold back”) the expression $\mathbf{F}(t)\cdot\mathbf{z}$ to the interval $q\in(-\ell,\ell)$, by writing

$$\mathbf{z}(t)=\begin{pmatrix}(-)^{s(t)}p_{0}\\
\left[\left(q_{0}+p_{0}t/m\right)\!\!\!\!\!\!\mod2\ell\right]-\ell
\end{pmatrix}\,,\qquad t\in(0^{+},T^{+})\,,\label{eq: actual coordinates after one period}$$

where the value of the integer $s(t)$ is determined by writing $q+pt/m=\overline{q}(t)+2\ell s$, with $\overline{q}(t)\in

Similarly to derivation of the approximation for the deterministic NSE in Section \[sec:approx\], we can approximate the stochastic NSE (\[sns7\])-(\[sns9\]) by freezing the velocity as in (\[eq:freeze\]): $$v(t,x)\approx \hat{v}(t,x):=v(t_{k},x):=\hat{v}(x),\ t_{k}<t\leq t_{k+1},
\label{eq:freeze2}$$and obtain an approximation $\tilde{\omega}(t,x)$ of $\omega (t,x)$ on $\
t_{k}\leq t\leq t_{k+1},$ as follows $$\begin{aligned}
d\tilde{\omega}=\left[ \frac{\sigma ^{2}}{2}\Delta \tilde{\omega}-(\hat{v}%
,\nabla )\tilde{\omega}+g(t,x)\right] dt+\sum_{r=1}^{q}\mu
_{r}(t,x)dw_{r}(t),\ t_{k}<t\leq t_{k+1},  \label{sns11} \\
\tilde{\omega}(t_{k},x)=\omega (t_{k},x),\ \ \tilde{\omega}(t_{k},x+Le_{j})=%
\tilde{\omega}(t_{k},x),\ j=1,2.  \label{sns12}\end{aligned}$$

It is not difficult to see that the local error $\delta _{\omega }(t,x)=%
\tilde{\omega}(t,x)-\omega (t,x),$ $t_{k}\leq t\leq t_{k+1},$ for the approximation $\tilde{\omega}(t,x)$ of the solution $\omega (t,x)$ of the stochastic NSE (\[sns7\])-(\[sns9\]) satisfies the problem of the same form as (\[M8\])-(\[M9\]) but with positive direction of time: $$\begin{aligned}
d\delta _{\omega }=\left[ \frac{\sigma ^{2}}{2}\Delta \delta _{\omega
}-(v,\nabla )\delta _{\omega }-((v-\hat{v}),\nabla )\tilde{\omega}\right] dt,
\label{sns14} \\
\delta _{\omega }(t_{k},x)=0.  \label{sns15}\

Entropy function and the regular black hole {#sec:rbh:E}
===========================================

In this section we confirm that the entropy function analysis of the regular black hole reproduces the near horizon geometry of the known solution found in [@gr-qc/0403109]. This merely entails considering the results of the previous section with the appropriate value of $\lambda/P$.

As discussed in section \[rbh\], the regular black hole corresponds to the point $\lambda/P={w_{0}}$, so that (\[eq:x\]) becomes, $$\label{eq:rbh:eom1}
  \cosh\xi = {w_{0}}^{-1/2}\xi.$$ One can analytically check, using the property $w_{0}e^{w_{0}}=e^{-1}$, that (\[eq:rbh:eom1\]) has a solution, $$\label{u:rbh}
 \xi=\frac{w_{0}+1}{2},$$ or in other words ${\mathcal{F}}(w_{0})=\frac{1}{2}(w_{0}+1)$. We have plotted the position of the regular solution as a blue dot in figures \[fig:2\] and \[fig:3\], from which we observe that it is on the large branch.

Finally, one can check that substituting the solution, (\[u:rbh\]), into (\[eq:def:g\]) and (\[eq:sol:v1\]) reproduces (\[result:rbh\]) and we are done.

Conclusion {#sec:conc}
==========

In this paper we examine entropy function formalism for regular magnetically charged black hole solution in Einstein-Hilbert gravity coupled with a certain non-linear $U(1)$ gauge field. The mass and charge of the full solution can be tuned so that it has no curvature singularity at the centre. In the extremal limit this corresponds to a particular charge to non-linear coupling ratio with an $AdS_2\times S^2$ near horizon geometry. Unsurprisingly we find that the entropy function analysis match with the exact solution found by solving the full Einstein equations. This is in contrast with the claim in the recent papers [@0705.2478; @0707.1933].

Indeed in the entropy function formalism, the equation of motion, which follow from extremizing the entropy function, are exactly the same as equation of motion at horizon found by extremizing the action, simply because

We do not pretend to cover the whole range of problems concerning the channeling effect, the channeling radiation and the radiation formed in the undulators. This section is devoted solely for a brief description of the effects closely related to the main subject of this review.

Channeling {#Channeling}
----------

The basic effect of the [*channeling process in a straight crystal*]{} is that a charged particle can penetrate at an anomalously large distance when traveling nearly parallel to a crystallographic plane (the planar channeling) or an axis (the axial channeling) and experiencing the collective action of the electrostatic field of the lattice ions. The latter is repulsive at small distances for positively charged particles and, therefore, they are steered into the interatomic region, while negatively charged projectiles move in the close vicinity of ion strings or planes.

Channeling was discovered in the early 1960s by computer simulations of ion motion in crystals of various structure [@RobinsonOen1963]. Large penetration lengths were obtained for low-energy (up to 10 keV) ions incident along crystallographic directions of low indexes. These calculations allowed to explain the results of earlier experiments. Later, a comprehensive theoretical study [@Lindhard] introduced the important model of continuum potential for the interaction energetic charged projectiles and lattice atoms arranged in strings and planes. Using this approach the criterion for a stable channeling was formulated. According to it the beam of particles becomes trapped by the interplanar or axial potential if the incident angle of the beam with respect to the crystal plane or the axis is smaller than the so-called critical Lindhard angle $\theta_L$. These concepts were subsequently widely used to interprete channeling experiments for low energy projectiles (${\varepsilon}< 1$ GeV), see, e.g., [@Gemmell], and for high energies of the particles (${\varepsilon}=1\dots 10^2$ GeV) [@RelCha; @SorensenUggerhoj1989; @Instrum; @BaurichterBiinoEtal2000; @BiryukovChesnokovKotovBook]. In recent years channeling of charged particles in straight nano-tubes, usually carbon nano-tubes, has been intensively investigated [@KlimovLetokhov]-[@ZhevagoGlebov2003]. We mention these papers for the sake of completeness but do not pretend to review them, since this field is not related directly to the main subject of our research.

abstract: 'The interpolated bounce-back scheme and the immersed boundary method are the two most popular algorithms in treating a no-slip boundary on curved surfaces in the lattice Boltzmann method. While those algorithms are frequently implemented in the numerical simulations involving complex geometries, such as particle-laden flows, their performances are seldom compared systematically over the same local quantities within the same context. In this paper, we present a systematic comparative investigation on some frequently used and most state-of-the-art interpolated bounce-back schemes and immersed boundary methods, based on both theoretical analyses and numerical simulations of four selected 2D and 3D laminar flow problems. Our analyses show that immersed boundary methods (IBM) typically yield a first-order accuracy when the regularized delta-function is employed to interpolate velocity from the Eulerian to Lagrangian mesh, and the resulting boundary force back to the Eulerian mesh. This first order in accuracy for IBM is observed for both the local velocity and hydrodynamic force/torque, apparently different from the second-order accuracy sometime claimed in the literature. Another serious problem of immersed boundary methods is that the local stress within the diffused fluid-solid interface tends to be significantly underestimated. On the other hand, the interpolated bounce-back generally possesses a second-order accuracy for velocity, hydrodynamic force/torque, and local stress field. The main disadvantage of the interpolated bounce-back schemes is its higher level of fluctuations in the calculated hydrodynamic force/torque when a solid object moves across the grid lines. General guidelines are also provided for the necessary grid resolutions in the two approaches in order to accurately simulate flows over a solid particle.'

1.  The temporal variability of the warm absorber in MCG$-$6-30-15 as seen by [*ASCA*]{} suggests that it is comprised of at least two zones. The inner zone may be related to the broad line region whereas the outer zone is at radii characteristic of the putative molecular torus and the narrow line region.

2.  The absence of neutral absorption, which is naively expected to accompany the optical reddening in both MCG$-$6-30-15 and IRAS 13349+2438, suggests that the warm absorber may be dusty. In MCG$-$6-30-15, this dust must lie in the outer warm absorber or else it would be sublimated by the intense AGN radiation field.

I am indebted to Andy Fabian, Chiko Otani and Martin Ward with whom much of this work was performed in collaboration. This work was supported by a PPARC (UK) studentship and the National Science Foundation under grant AST-9529175.

[N. Arav]{} How well can you constrain the properties of the two-zone model for explaining the [Ovii]{}/[Oviii]{} edges?

[C. Reynolds]{} MCG$-$6-30-15 shows a fairly clean pattern of variability – the [Ovii]{} edge remains essentially constant whilst only the [Oviii]{} edge varies. In this case we can decouple the two zones quite easily. In a more general case (i.e., both oxygen edges varying) it is rather more difficult. This may be the case in some other Seyfert galaxies (e.g., NGC 3227) in which a complex pattern of warm absorber variability is seen.

[C. Foltz]{} What is known about the ultraviolet spectrum of MCG$-$6-30-15? Is Mg[ii]{} absorption seen?

[C. Reynolds]{} Not much is known. [*IUE*]{} shows it to be a rather faint UV source and I’m not aware of a [*HST*]{} UV spectrum of this object. To my knowledge, the only UV feature that has definitely been detected is the [Civ]{}$\lambda 1549$ line (even the continuum is barely detected). This is all consistent with it being heavily reddened.

[E. Agol]{} What happens to the Fe K$\alpha$ line as the warm absorber varies? Is there any evidence

An almost identical argument shows the following analogous result for the property of *strong convexity* with respect to the norm $\|\cdot\|_Q$ and affine changes of coordinates.

\[lem-strong-aff\] Suppose $f: \reals^n \rightarrow \reals$, $Q$ is a centrally symmetric convex set with nonempty interior and let $A\in\reals^{n \times n}$ be a nonsingular matrix. Suppose $f$ is strongly convex with respect to the norm $\|\cdot\|_Q$ with parameter $\sigma>0$, i.e. $$f(y) \geq f(x) +\langle \nabla f(x),y-x\rangle +\frac{1}{2}\sigma\|y-x\|_Q^2, \quad x,y\in Q,$$ if and only if the function $f(Ax)$ is strongly convex with respect to the norm $\|\cdot\|_{A^{-1}Q}$ with the same parameter $\sigma$.

We now turn our attention to the choice of prox function in Algorithm \[alg:smooth\].

Choosing the prox {#ss:prox}
-----------------

Choosing the norm as $\|\cdot\|_Q$ allows us to define a norm without introducing an arbitrary geometry in the algorithm, since the norm is extracted directly from the problem definition. When $Q$ is smooth, a similar reasoning allows us to choose the prox term in Algorithm \[alg:smooth\], and we can set $d(x)=\|x\|_Q^2$. The immediate impact of this choice is that the term $d(x^*)$ in  is bounded by one, by construction. This choice has other natural benefits which are highlighted below. We first recall a result showing that the conjugate of a squared norm is the squared dual norm.

\[lem:conj-sqr\] Let $\|\cdot\|$ be a norm and $\|\cdot\|^*$ its dual norm, then $$\frac{1}{2}\left(\|y\|^*\right)^2=\sup_x ~y^Tx - \frac{1}{2} \|x\|^2.$$

We recall the proof in [@Boyd03 Example3.27] as it will prove useful in what follows. By definition, $x^Ty\leq \|y\|^* \|x\|$, hence $$y^Tx - \frac{1}{2} \|x\|^2 \leq \|y\|^* \|x\|

We observe that the clustering errors defined in the previous section may be generalized by abstracting their common properties. We define the following properties of a *natural* clustering error, which is any integer-valued error that decreases when we locally improve the proposed clustering.

\[def:natural-clustering-error\] We say that a clustering error is *natural* if it satisfies the following properties:

-   If there exists a cluster $C_{i}$ that contains points from $C^{\ast}_{j}$ and some other ground-truth cluster(s), then splitting this cluster into two clusters $C_{i,1} = C_{i} \cap C^{\ast}_{j}$ (which contains only points from $C^{\ast}_{j}$), and $C_{i,2} = C_{i} - C_{i,1}$ (which contains the other points) must decrease the error.

-   If there exists two clusters that contain only points from the same target cluster, then merging them into one cluster must decrease the error.

-   The error is integer-valued.

We expect a lot of definitions of clustering error to satisfy the above criteria (especially the first two properties), in addition to other domain-specific criteria. Clearly, the under/overclustering error $\delta = \delta_{u} + \delta_{o}$ and the correlation-clustering error $\delta_{cc}$ are also *natural* clustering errors (Claim \[claim:natural-errors\]). As before, for a *natural* clustering error $\gamma$, a proposed clustering $\mathcal{C}$ and the target clustering $\mathcal{C}^{\ast}$, we will use $\gamma(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{C}^{\ast})$ to denote the magnitude of the error of $\mathcal{C}$ with respect to $\mathcal{C}^{\ast}$.

Moreover, it is easy to see that the under/overclustering error defined in the previous section is the lower-bound on any *natural* clustering error (Theorem \[thm:generalized-clustering-error\]).

\[claim:natural-errors\] The under/overclustering error and the correlation clustering error satisfy Definition \[def:natural-clustering-error\] and hence are natural clustering errors.

\[thm:generalized-clustering-error\] For any *natural* clustering error $\gamma$, any proposed clustering $\mathcal{C}$, and any target clustering $\mathcal

### Objects with unreliable redshifts {#objects-with-unreliable-redshifts .unnumbered}

-   ‘Single emission line’ : the spectra contain only a single emission line which cannot allow a unique redshift determination. For this population, the CFHT T0006 photometric redshifts are compared to the $\left[\mathrm{O\textrm{\textsc{ii}}}\right]$ redshift (assuming the single emission line is $\left[\mathrm{O\textrm{\textsc{ii}}}\right]$) in Fig. \[sinlgeEmLowContiRedshift\]. The two estimates agree very well : 77.7 percent have $(z_{spec} - z_{phot})/(1+ z_{spec})<0.1$ for the *gri* selection and 62.7 percent for the *ugr* selection. These galaxies with uncertain redshift tend to have slightly fainter magnitudes with a mean CFHT *g* magnitude at 22.6 and a scatter of 0.6, whereas for the whole ELGs is 22.4 with a scatter of 0.4.

-   ‘Low continuum’ spectra that show a $4000 \AA$ break too weak for a secure redshift estimate. The agreement between photometric and spectroscopic redshift estimation is excellent : 84.6 percent within 10 percent errors; see Fig. \[sinlgeEmLowContiRedshift\].

-   ‘Bad data’, the spectrum is either featureless, extremely noisy or both.

The detailed physical properties of the ELGs are discussed in section \[properties\] and a number of representative spectra are displayed in Appendix \[tble\_appendix\].

($\spadesuit$) A node $v$ has a black pebble (resp. a white pebble) on it at time $t$ with respect to $P'$ iff $b(v) \geq 1/2$ (resp. $w(v) > 1/2$) at time $t$ with respect to $P$.

An important consequence of this invariant is that if at time $t$ in $P$ node $v$ satisfies $b(v)+w(v)=1$ then at time $t$ in $P'$ node $v$ is pebbled.

We describe when a pebble is placed or removed in $P$. At the beginning, there are no pebbles on any nodes. $P'$ simulates $P$ as follows. Assume there is a certain configuration of pebbles on $D$, placed according to $P'$ after time $t-1$; we describe how $P$’s move at time $t$ is reflected in $P'$. If in the current move of $P$, $b(v)$ (resp. $w(v)$) increases to $1/2$ or greater (resp. greater than $1/2$) for some node $v$, then the current pebble, if any, on $v$, is removed and a black pebble (resp. a white pebble) is placed on $v$ in $P'$. Note that this is always consistent with the pebbling rules. If in the current configuration of $P'$ there is a black (resp. white) pebble on a vertex $v$, and in the current move of $P$, $b(v)$ (resp. $w(v)$) falls below $1/2$, then the pebble on $v$ is removed. Again, this is always consistent with the pebbling rules for the black-white pebble game and the fractional black-white pebble game. For all other kinds of moves of $P$, the configuration in $P'$ does not change.

If $P$ is a valid sequence of fractional pebbling moves, then $P'$ is a valid sequence of pebbling moves. We argue that the cost of $P'$ is at most twice the cost of $P$, and that if there is a point at which the root has black pebble value $1$ with respect to

Let now $A=\frac MN$ (rational number expressed as an irreducible fraction) and $B<\infty$. The integral in (\[EqFinal\]) does not tend to zero if and only if $\frac{2Mj}N+k=0$. Accordingly, in the summation over $j$, only terms with $j=N'\ell$, $\ell\in\mathbb Z^d$ remains non-zero in the limit, where $N'=N$ for odd $N$ and $N'=\frac N2$ for even $N$. In the summation over $k$, only the term with $k=-\frac{2Mj}N$ remains non-zero in the limit.

Consider the term $i\hbar t_\hbar j^2$ in the exponent in the right-hand side of (\[EqFinal\]). If $N$ is odd then $$\hbar t_\hbar j^2\sim2\pi\frac MN(N\ell)^2=2\pi MN\ell^2\in2\pi\mathbb Z^d$$ (we write $f\sim g$ whenever $\lim\frac fg=1$) and this term may be dropped. If $N$ is even, then $$\hbar t_\hbar j^2\sim2\pi \frac MN\left(\frac{N\ell}2\right)^2=\pi\frac{MN\ell^2}2.$$ If $N$ is divisible by four, then this number again belongs to $2\pi\mathbb Z^d$ and may be dropped. If $N$ is even, but not divisible by four, then $M$ is odd and $$\exp\left\lbrace i\hbar t_\hbar j^2 \right\rbrace \sim\exp\left\lbrace i\pi\frac{MN\ell^2}2\right\rbrace=(-1)^{N'\ell I}=
\exp\left\lbrace i\pi N'\ell I\right\rbrace.$$ Thus, the second term in the limiting expression in (\[EqFinal\]) can be rewritten as $$\begin{aligned}
\label{EqSums}
\frac1{(2\pi)^{\frac d2}}&\sum_{\ell\in\mathbb Z^d}\sigma_{BN'\ell}a_{N'\ell}(p_0)
\exp\left\lbrace

Introduction
============

Fabric composites are becoming an essential part of impact shields that protect spacecrafts from micrometeoroids and orbital debris. Present protection systems are based on the original Whipple shield [@whipple] that consists of two rigid (typically metal) layers spaced some distance from each other. This design allows to deal with particles with velocities up to 10-18 kilometres per second. An additional protection is provided by stuffed Whipple shields [@christiansen1995], that include high-strength materials between rigid layers. The International Space Station uses different types of Whipple shields widely [@nasa]. Moreover, the International Space Station starts to use experimental inflatable modules, that use flexible fabric protection system without rigid layers that presented in the original Whipple shield. Computer design and optimization of stuffed Whipple shields and flexible protection system requires modeling of high-strength fabric composites under dynamic loading.

There is a number of works on numerical and experimental studies of fabric materials under a shock load, naming [@kobylkin_selivanov; @walker1999; @walker2001; @porval] as an examples. Most of them consider a single relatively large impactor moving with the velocity 300-700 meters per second. However, for stuffed Whipple shields the load is completely different – the initial particle is destroyed by the outer rigid layer, and the fabric layer is exposed to a cloud of small fragments distributed over time and space and moving with the velocity around 5-9 kilometres per second.

From mathematical model point of view this load profile means that it is not possible to consider the problem to be quasi static, since the speed of the fragments is comparable with the sound speed in the composite membrane. The stress-strain state of the composite layer should be calculated as the dynamic problem, and the elastic waves caused by the impact should be analyzed. Modeling of composite layer under asymmetric load requires also using anisotropic tensor of material elastic parameters and having three degrees of freedom for each point.

This work aims to provide all these features still describing composite layer as 2D object, since this allows to reduce computational time compared with 3D models. The same mathematical model and numerical method can be used later for numerical study of different processes in thin composite layers, such as ultrasound propagation, non-destructive testing procedures, vibrations.

This work is based on the models for thin fibers and membranes from [@rakhmatulin]. This work uses the same approach

Taking into account Eq.(21b) we write down in the modified spin-2 field equations which govern this system (note that $E^{\bar{p}\bar{a}\bar{b}\bar{c}}=0$ remains intact). They have the aspect $$`F_{pa}\equiv F_{pa}+\gamma_2(\partial_ph_a-\partial_a h_p)-\rho
\varepsilon_{pab}h_b-\varepsilon \varepsilon_{pab} v_b =0.$$

An additional vector-like field equation appears after varying $v_p$, $$G_p\equiv \gamma_1 \varepsilon_p^{mn}\partial_mv_n +\delta\mu v_p+2
\varepsilon\mu h_p =0.$$

We want to determine $\gamma_1,\gamma_2,\rho ,\delta ,\varepsilon$ in such a way that none of the six spin-1 variables: $\omega_8\equiv (\wh{\partial}_{pab}w_{\bar{p}\bar{a}\bar{b}\bar{c}})^T$, $\omega_9\equiv (\wh{\partial}_{pa}h_{\bar{p}\bar{a}\bar{b}})^T$, $\omega_{11}\equiv (\wh{\partial}_p u_{\bar{p}\bar{a}})^T$, $\omega_{11}\equiv h^T_p$, $\omega_{12}\equiv h^T_p$, $\omega_{13}\equiv
v^T_p$ can propagate. Since $\omega_8$ is given by $\partial_{pab}E_{p\bar{a}\bar{b}\bar{c}}$ in terms of the five remaining variables $\omega_9\cdots \omega_{13}$ we go after the non propagation of them.

They are determined by $\partial_{ab}\check{E}_{\bar{b}\bar{a}\bar{c}}=0$, $\partial_bE_{\bar{b}\bar{c}}=0$, $\partial_p `F_{pa}=0$, $`\check{F}^b=0$ and $G^p=0$ After minor algebra and some use of Eq.(24) the five equations become $$\begin{aligned}

Scattering from impurities along one boundary is prevented from topological protection. Nevertheless, by etching the quantum well over a short region to form a Quantum Point Contact (QPC), the two boundaries are brought close to each other \[see Fig.\[fig-setup\]\], inducing inter-boundary tunneling [@hLL; @liu; @mio]. Due to the helical nature of the edges, an electron flowing along a given direction can only tunnel to the other boundary by reversing its group velocity [@nota]. Tunneling thus plays the same role as the BS in a quantum wire, and is described by a term $$\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{H}^{}_{tun}  =  \displaystyle   \left. \frac{\hbar v_{\rm F} \gamma}{2\pi a} \!  \! \! \sum_{m=\pm, \sigma=\uparrow, \downarrow} \! \!  \! \! \! \! m   \,   \kappa_{L \sigma} \kappa_{R \sigma}  \,  \, e^{i m   \sqrt{2 \pi} (\xi_{c+} + \sigma \xi_{s+})}\right|_{x=0}  \label{Htun-p} \end{aligned}$$ where $\gamma$ is the dimensionless tunneling amplitude. Indeed Eq.(\[Htun-p\]) has the same form as (\[BS-bos1\]), and we shall utilize the expression ‘backward scattering’ (‘BS’) to emphasize such analogy. Furthermore, with the voltages $V_{g,T}$ and $V_{g,B}$ of two gates located at the two sides of the constriction, and coupled to the edge states over a lengthscale $l_g$ \[see Fig.\[fig-setup\]\], one generates local FS potential terms, namely $V_{g,T} (\rho_{R\uparrow}+\rho_{L\downarrow})$ for the top boundary, and $V_{g,B} (\rho_{R\downarrow}+\rho_{L\uparrow})$ for the bottom boundary, where $\rho_{r \sigma}=e \, \Psi^\dagger_{r \sigma} \Psi^{}_{r \sigma}$. Despite these similarities, important differences emerge with respect to the case of a quantum wire. Indeed, due to the space separation between the edge states, the two gates voltages couple differently to the edges, so that here two independently tunable FS terms appear. This difference can be highlighted by

By using different target structures in MC simulations of protein folding we have identified two distinct folding regimes depending on the chain length. In close agreement with experimental observations we found a first regime that describes well the folding of small protein molecules and whose kinetics is single exponential. Folding of protein chains with more than 80 amino acids, on the other hand, belongs to a dynamical regime that appears to be target sensitive with some targets being more highly foldable than others. In this case we ascribe folding failure to existing kinetic traps but we have not been able to carry out our simulations for long enough times in order to observe escape and succesfull folding.

Because the additive MJ lattice polymer model fails to exhibit the remarkable dispersion of folding rates observed in real proteins one should interpret the results for the dependence of folding times on contact order parameter with caution. However, our results strongly suggest that the geometry driven cooperativity is rather robust and this implies an increase in folding times for increasing cooperativity.

We have analysed the role of LR contacts in the folding kinetics of small Gō-type lattice polymers and found a considerably strong dependence on target geometry. In particular, we have found that targets with a similar fraction of LR contacts (that is, targets with similar LRO parameter) and different contact order exhibit considerably different folding rates when LR contacts are destabilized energetically with respect to local contacts. We are currently investigating this issue and results will be published elsewhere (in preparation). This result may provide a clue to understanding the increadible dispersion of folding rates exhibited by real two-state folders: one can expect to observe longer folding times if the distribution of contact energies in real proteins is such that local contacts are, on average, more stable than LR contacts for specific native folds.

Curving a flat sheet involves locally stretching and compressing the material by certain amounts at each point. According to the rules of differential geometry, this stretching factor, controlled by the field $\Phi$, is determined by an equation identical to the Poisson equation of electrostatics [@vitelli_anomalous_2004], with the Gaussian curvature, $G$, playing the role of a continuous charge distribution [@bowick_two-dimensional_2009; @vitelli_crystallography_2006]: $$\label{harmonicPhi}
\nabla^2 \Phi({\mathbf{x}}) = - G({\mathbf{x}}).$$ As the sheet equilibrates, its elasticity tends to oppose this mechanical constraint, giving rise to stress. The isotropic stress from curvature is then related to the potential via $\sigma^G_{kk}=E \Phi $, where $E$ is Young’s modulus, and the stress components are determined by integrals of the potential and boundary conditions (see Eqns. 25-26 of the *Supplementary Information*). Our study rests on a general geometric principle: positive (negative) curvature promotes local stretching (compression) of an elastic sheet, leading to the enhancement (suppression) of crack initiation. Variations in the potential $\Phi$ steer the crack path, with the form of $\Phi$ determined nonlocally from the curvature distribution (see Eqn. \[harmonicPhi\] and Eqns. 39-41 of the *Supplementary Information*).

For the bump, the curvature potential, $\Phi$, is large on the cap, where curvature is positive, and decays to zero as the negative curvature ring screens the cap (Fig. \[fig2\]a). As $E\Phi$ is the isotropic stress, crack growth is stimulated where the potential is greatest — on the cap of the bump, resulting in a small Griffith length there (Fig. \[fig2\]b). Moving away from the cap, the potential decays, producing a stress asymmetry. This results in longer Griffith lengths with strong orientation dependence on the outskirts of the bump (see Eqns. 39-41 of the *Supplementary Information*). Fig. \[fig2\]b shows the theoretical results overlying the experimental data, with no fitting parameters. We find that this minimal model is sufficient to capture the phenomenology of our system at the onset of fracture and provides correct qualitative predictions for longer cracks, even in the absence of symmetry.

Curvature not only governs the critical length for fracture initiation, but

To study the effect of $J_3$ on the bonds along the rung, diagonal and leg directions, we calculate correlations $C^R$, $C^D$ and $C^L$, respectively as shown in Fig. \[fig:cor1\]. The calculations of these three correlations are confined to the first neighbor along the respective directions. $|C^R|$ increases exponentially with $J_3$ and follows $|C^R| = 0.25(1-0.60exp(-1.48J_3))$. $C^D$ and $C^L$ are represented by square and diamond symbols, respectively, and both these bond orders exponentially decrease with $J_3$. The exponent of the $C^D$ and $C^L$ are 0.42 and 1.50 respectively. $C^L$ decays faster than $C^D$, because $J_2$ allows the magnon to deconfine along the leg of the zigzag ladder; therefore weaker $J_2$ reduces $C^L$.

The correlation function $C(r)$ of the system shows the short range spin order. Therefore, we explore the excitation energy or spin gap in the system. The rung interaction dominates other interactions; thus we expect the opening of the spin gap $\Delta$. We calculate $\Delta$ for various $J_3=0.1, 0.3, 0.4$ and 0.5. The main Fig. \[fig:spin\_gap\] shows the extrapolation of the spin gap $\Delta$, from which we obtain the spin gap $\Delta_\infty$ in the thermodynamic limit. $\Delta_\infty$ increases algebraically with $J_3$, as shown in the inset of Fig. \[fig:spin\_gap\] for $J_2=0.1$ and 0.15. The algebraic exponent $\gamma$ for $J_2=0.1$ and 0.15 are 3.33 and 3.13, respectively. We notice that $\gamma$ decreases with increasing $J_2$. This may be due to the delocalization of magnon along the leg of zigzag ladder. The large $J_2/|J_1|$ enhances the interaction of spin along each leg of zigzag ladder and the each leg of the system can have quasi-long range correlation like a normal Heisenberg chain, in $J_2/|J_1|>>1$ limit.

The computation of the non-vanishing $2^{8}$ traces $T_n$ shows that they all have the values $\pm 1/16$. This structure is easily understood. Applying the projectors $P_s(3)$ and $P_s(2)$ to a given vector successively leads to alternating projections on different subspaces. Each projection gives a factor $\pm 1/\sqrt{2}$, with the sign depending upon the $s_{in}$. There are 144 values of $n$ with $T_n=1/16$ and 112 with $T_n=-1/16$. Obviously $\sum_nT_n=2$ as it should. A further simplification is obtained from the symmetry $T_n(s_{in}) = T_n(-s_{in})$, which is easily seen by inserting $\sigma _1\sigma _1$ between all projectors and using $\sigma
_1P_s(m)\sigma _1 = P_{-s}(m)$ for $m=2,3$. Together with the symmetry $A_{\rho \nu }^n(p;\Theta ,s_{in}) = - A_{\rho \nu }^n(p;\Theta

abstract: 'We describe digital tracking, a method for asteroid searches that greatly increases the sensitivity of a telescope to faint unknown asteroids. It has been previously used to detect faint Kuiper Belt objects using the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based instruments, and to find a small, fast-moving asteroid during a close approach to Earth. We complement this earlier work by developing digital tracking methodology for detecting asteroids using large-format CCD imagers. We demonstrate that the technique enables the ground-based detection of large numbers of new faint asteroids. Our methodology resolves or circumvents all major obstacles to the large-scale application of digital tracking for finding main belt and near-Earth asteroids. We find that for both asteroid populations, digital tracking can deliver a factor of ten improvement over conventional searches. Digital tracking has long been standard practice for deep Kuiper Belt surveys, but even there our methodology enables deeper integrations than have yet been attempted. Our search for main belt asteroids using a one-degree imager on the 0.9m WIYN telescope on Kitt Peak validates our methodology, delivers sensitivity to asteroids in a regime previously probed only with 4-meter and larger instruments, and leads to the detection of 156 previously unknown asteroids and 59 known objects in a single field. Digital tracking has the potential to revolutionize searches for faint moving objects ranging from the Kuiper Belt through main belt and near-Earth asteroids, and perhaps even anthropogenic space debris in low Earth orbit.'

Introduction
============

Thousands of new asteroids are discovered every year by dedicated searches such as LINEAR [@Stokes2000], Spacewatch [@Gehrels1996], the Catalina Sky Survey [@Larson2007], NEAT [@Helin1997; @Pravdo1999], and others; by more general sky surveys such as Pan-STARRS [@Denneau2013] and WISE [@mainzer2012]; and by advanced amateur astronomers. The fundamental methodology of the detection is the same in all cases: an asteroid is identified as an object that changes its position in a systematic fashion relative to the starfield, and is detected individually in each of three to five different images [@Larson2007]. A good example of a highly successful automated implementation of this methodology is the

These results, however, were marginally significant and possibly subject to large systematic errors as pointed by the authors themselves, in particular galaxy evolutionary corrections.

Most of the constraints derived from clusters nowadays are not obtained from a fit to a Hubble diagram but rather from the variation of the number density of clusters as a function of redshift as described below.

Clusters as cosmological probes
-------------------------------

In the framework of the cold dark matter model, the number density of dark matter halos as a function of redshift can be calculated and compared to numbers obtained in large area cluster surveys that nowadays extend to high enough redshift.

Galaxy clusters are the largest virialized[^8] objects in the universe and are therefore expected to trace dark matter halos. The difficulty arises from the fact that clusters are, in practice, selected according to some observable $O$, such as X-ray luminosity or temperature. Other observables often used are cluster galaxy richness, weak lensing shear or Sunayaev-Zeldovich effect on the cosmic microwave background flux. The relation of these observable $O$ selected cluster distributions with cluster mass distributions can be written as $$\frac{d^{2}N(z)}{dzd\Omega} = \frac{d_M(z)}{H(z)} 
\int^{\infty}_{0}f(O,z)dO\int^{\infty}_{0}p(O|M,z)\frac{dn(z)}{dM}dM ~,
\label{eq:clustercount}$$ where $f(O,z)$ is the observable redshift dependent selection function, $dn(z)/dM$ is the comoving density of dark halos, and $p(O|M,z)$ is the probability that a halo of mass $M$ at redshift $z$ is observed as a cluster with observable $O$.

Eq. (\[eq:clustercount\]) is sensitive to cosmology through the comoving volume element $ d_M^2(z)/H(z)$ (Eq \[eq:dvdz\]) and the growth of structure term, $dn(z)/dM$ which depends on the primordial spectrum and the evolution of density perturbations. As mentioned above, several techniques are used to detect clusters as well as for estimating their masses. Systematic uncertainties, however, can greatly affect the determination of the mass-observable relation $p(O|M,z)$ and of the selection function $f(

We define the raw asymmetry in each $\Dt$ bin by $(N_{q=+1}-N_{q=-1})/(N_{q=+1}+N_{q=-1})$, where $N_{q=+1(-1)}$ is the number of observed candidates with $q=+1(-1)$. Figure \[fig:asym\] shows the raw asymmetries for the $\ks\piz\gamma$ events. Note that these are simple projections onto the $\Delta t$ axis, and do not reflect other event-by-event information (such as the signal fraction, the wrong tag fraction and the vertex resolution), which is in fact used in the unbinned maximum-likelihood fit for ${{\mathcal S}}$ and ${{\mathcal A}}$.

Systematic Error
----------------

Primary sources of the systematic error are (1) uncertainties in the resolution function ($\pm 0.06$ for ${{\mathcal S}}_{\ks\piz\gamma}$ and $\pm 0.03$ for ${{\mathcal A}}_{\ks\piz\gamma}$), (2) uncertainties in the vertex reconstruction ($\pm 0.03$ for ${{\mathcal S}}_{\ks\piz\gamma}$ and $\pm 0.04$ for ${{\mathcal A}}_{\ks\piz\gamma}$) and (3) uncertainties in the background fraction ($\pm 0.07$ for ${{\mathcal S}}_{\ks\piz\gamma}$ and $\pm 0.03$ for ${{\mathcal A}}_{\ks\piz\gamma}$). Effects of tag-side interference [@Long:2003wq] contribute $\pm 0.07$ for ${{\mathcal A}}_{\ks\piz\gamma}$. Also included are effects from uncertainties in the wrong tag fraction and physics parameters (${\Delta m_d}$, $\taubz$ and ${{\mathcal A}}_{\kstarz\gamma}$). Fitting a large sample of MC events revealed no bias in the fit procedure. The statistical errors from the MC fit are assigned as systematic errors. The total systematic error is obtained by adding these contributions in quadrature.

Crosschecks
-----------

Various crosschecks of the measurement are performed. We apply the same fit procedure to the $\bz\to\jpsi\ks$ sample without using $\jpsi$ daughter tracks for the vertex reconstruction [@bib:sqq05]. We obtain ${{\mathcal S}}_{\jpsi\ks} = +0.73\pm 0.08$(stat) and ${{\mathcal A}}_{\jpsi\ks}

We then compared the flux measured inside the cavity contours in Fig. 1a to that expected from the $\beta$-model. The NW cavity has 33 sigma significance compared to the best fit $\beta$-model, while the less pronounced SE cavity has 13 sigma significance. Forcing the $\beta$-model normalization to be consistent with the observed cavity flux increases the reduced chisquare of the fit by a factor of 2.7 (NW cavity) and 1.9 (SE cavity), corresponding to a significance of 8.5 and 6 respectively.

The radio overlay in Fig. 1a shows that the 8GHz radio lobes are only partly coincident with the cavities. The NW lobe covers a good fraction of the NW cavity. The SE lobe is much smaller than the northern lobe and not spatially coincident with the SE cavity. We note, however, that low-frequency radio observations sensitive to spatial scales of $0.1-1$arcmin, which might reveal the full extent of the radio lobes, do not yet exist.

The central peak contains interesting sub-structure (Fig. 1b., smoothed to a S/N of 3-4). The brightest sub peak, which is well resolved by CXO and has a diameter of 3–4$\sim$ 3–4kpc, is coincident with the core of PKS 2354–35 (within the CXO pointing accuracy) and could be emission from the hot interstellar medium of the central galaxy. The three sub-peaks are located around a local brightness minimum. Our hardness ratio analysis (§\[sec:spec\]) suggests that this minimum is due to lack of emission rather than intervening absorption. The close correspondence between these peaks and the SE radio lobe suggests that this substructure might be caused by on-going interaction.

Spectroscopic Properties {#sec:spec}
------------------------

We used the adaptive binning routine of @sanders:01 to produce hardness ratio maps. We define the hardness ratios $h_{1} = (1-2{\rm \,
keV})/(0.3-1{\rm \, keV})$ and $h_{2} = (2-10{\rm \, keV})/(1-2{\rm \,
keV})$ as the ratio of the counts in the respective energy bands and $c_{1}$ as the surface brightness in the 0.3-10 keV band in ${\rm cts\
cm^{-2}\ s^{-1}\ pixel^{-1}}$. For ICM observations

Let us now set $$\label{cF}
{{\mathcal F}}({\varepsilon},B)({\theta}):= |\nabla{\phi_{{\varepsilon},B}}(1+{\varepsilon}B({\theta}),{\theta})|^2  - {c_{{\varepsilon},B}}\,
[R+{\varepsilon}(1+{\varepsilon}B({\theta}))\cos{\theta}]^2\,,$$ where the constant ${c_{{\varepsilon},B}}$ will be defined later. In view of the definition of the function $F$ (Equation ), one should notice that the Neumann condition  holds with a constant $c={\varepsilon}^2 {c_{{\varepsilon},B}}$ if and only if ${{\mathcal F}}({\varepsilon},B)+F_R$ is the zero function.

Next we pick the constant ${c_{{\varepsilon},B}}$ so that ${{\mathcal F}}({\varepsilon},B)$ is $L^2$-orthogonal to $\cos{\theta}$. The reason for which we do so will be clear later. This amounts to setting $$\label{ceB}
{c_{{\varepsilon},B}}:= \frac{\int_0^{2\pi} |\nabla{\phi_{{\varepsilon},B}}(1+{\varepsilon}B({\theta}),{\theta})|^2\cos{\theta}\,
  d{\theta}}{\int_0^{2\pi} [R+{\varepsilon}(1+{\varepsilon}B({\theta}))\cos{\theta}]^2\cos{\theta}\, d{\theta}}\,.$$

The following result guarantees that this choice of ${c_{{\varepsilon},B}}$ makes sense for all small enough ${\varepsilon}$, including ${\varepsilon}=0$, and shows that ${{\mathcal F}}(0,B)$ is in fact the constant $${\kappa}:=4A_0(A_0 -A_1R)\,,$$ which depends on $R$ but not on $B$. In what follows, we employ the notation $$\langle f,g\rangle:= \int_0^{2\pi} f({\theta})\, g({\theta})\, d{\theta}$$ for the $L^2$ product on $\TT$.

\[P.ceB\] For small enough ${\varepsilon}$ and any $B$, $$\begin{aligned}
{c_{{\varepsilon},B}}&= \frac{4A_0A_1}R + O({\varepsilon})\,,\\
{{\mathcal F}}({\varepsilon},B)&={\kappa}+O({\

Accuracy of HAM results depends on a number of numerical effects. Each of them should produce small enough errors so that the final result can be trustful. The effects include the tracking of subhaloes as they fall into larger haloes and become subhaloes [@Behroozi10]. Other effects include mass and force resolution, time-integration of equations of motion, and two-body scattering. Accuracy of halo tracking was discussed in [@Behroozi10]. Here we focus on the other effects. In order to study those, we investigate the statistics based on the instantaneous maximum of the circular velocity $\Vmax$.

Figure \[fig:Vmax\] presents the results of three simulations: Bolshoi, MultiDark, and BigMultiDark. To large degree the results are very similar to those based on $V_{\rm peak}$. Again, the comparison between Bolshoi and MultiDark shows convergence at 10% level for distinct haloes with $\Vmax>140\, \kms$ and for subhaloes with $\Vmax>200\,
\kms$. This implies that subhaloes need about 150 particles to have this accuracy. The comparison between BigMultiDark and MultiDark shows the same, i.e. in order to reach the 10% accuracy, one needs $\sim
150$ particles for subhaloes.

Convergence of the correlation function {#sec:Corr}
=======================================

![Comparison of the correlation functions for haloes in the MultiDark (full) and Bolshoi (dashed) simulations. Haloes were selected to have their peak circular velocities (maximum circular velocity over the accretion history of each halo) to be larger than $\Vpeak>200\,\kms$ for the bottom panel and $\Vpeak>220\,\kms$ for the top panel. Because of the lack of long waves in the Bolshoi, the correlation function in the MultiDark is larger for scales above $2\mpch$. Clustering at smaller scales is not affected by long waves and it is a test of numerical effects and convergence of simulations. At the 5% level the correlation functions agree for both simulations. For the MultiDark simulation, velocity limit $\Vpeak>200\,\kms$ corresponds on average of 160 particles.[]{data-label="fig:corrVV"}](Figs/correlationVacc.eps){width="84mm"}

---

Introduction {#intro}
============

The computational complexity of games and puzzles has been studied since the very begining of complexity theory. Several important complexity classes admit a very natural characterization in terms of games, with PSPACE being a typical example. Many real-life two-player games, such as Amazons, Go, Hex or Othello, have been proven to be PSPACE-complete when generalized to arbitrary board sizes [@epp]. In this paper we will add to this list the popular game of Scrabble, by proving the following theorem.

The problem of determining the winner of a Scrabble game, given an arbitrary Scrabble board position and an arbitrary sequence of letters left in the bag, is PSPACE-complete.

As an intermediate result we will obtain the result.

The problem of determining whether a given instance of a Scrabble solitaire game can be completed with using up the whole sequence of lettered tiles in the bag is NP-complete.

Our model of Scrabble {#model}
=====================

To study the complexity of Scrabble in terms of classical complexity classes we have to derandomize the only element of Scrabble based on chance, i.e. the drawing of lettered tiles. In our model we will assume that each player knows in advance the sequence of tiles she will draw[^1], which will make the game totally deterministic. Due to the same reason we will also require that the tiles exchanged during the play, which in a normal game would be shuffled back into the bag, return to the end of the sequence in the order in which they appeared on the rack of the player making the exchange. This is

The leading-logarithm three-loop contribution to $\amu^{\mysmall EW}$ was first studied via a renormalization group analysis in ref. [@DGi98]. Such an analysis was revisited and refined in [@CMV03], where this contribution was found to be extremely small (indeed, consistent with zero to a level of accuracy of $10^{-12}$). An uncertainty of $0.2\times
10^{-11}$, included in eq. (\[eq:ew\]), has been conservatively assigned to $\amu^{\mysmall EW}$ for uncalculated three-loop nonleading-logarithm terms.

Lastly, I would like to point out that until recently only one evaluation existed of the two-loop bosonic part of $\amu^{\mysmall EW}$, ie, ref. [@CKM95b]. The recent calculation of ref. [@HSW04], performed without the approximation of large Higgs mass previously employed, agrees with the result of [@CKM95b]. Work is also in progress for an independent recalculation based on the numerical methods of refs. [@Topside].

The Hadronic Contribution {#sec:HAD}
=========================

In this section I will analyze the contribution to the muon $g$$-$$2$ arising from [QED]{} diagrams involving hadrons. Hadronic effects in (two-loop) [EW]{} contributions are already included in $\amu^{\mysmall
EW}$ (see the previous section).

Leading-order Hadronic Contribution {#subsec:HLO}
-----------------------------------

The leading hadronic contribution to the muon $g$$-$$2$, $\amu^{\mbox{$\scriptscriptstyle{HLO}$}}$, is due to the hadronic vacuum polarization correction to the internal photon propagator of the one-loop diagram (see diagram in fig. \[fig:hlo\]).

![[Leading hadronic contribution to $\amu$.]{}[]{data-label="fig:hlo"}](hlo.eps){width="7cm"}

The evaluation of this $O(\alpha^2)$ diagram involves long-distance [QCD]{} for which perturbation theory cannot be employed. However, using analyticity and unitarity (the optical theorem), Bouchiat and Michel [@BM61] showed long ago that this contribution can be computed from hadronic $e^+ e^-$ annihilation data via the dispersion integral [@BM61; @LB

![The finding charts of CX377 for our Gemini/GMOS spectroscopy (left panel) and the VLT/VIMOS spectroscopy in Torres et al. (2014; right panel). The two short thick bars in each panel indicate the position of CX377, while the thin lines show the slit position. The sky area shown in both panels is $15^{\prime\prime}\times15^{\prime\prime}$. North is up and east is left in both panels.[]{data-label="fc_cx377_fig"}](fc_cx377_2.ps){width="3.4in"}

CX377 is spectrally classified as F6 type. The relative radial velocities between the Gemini spectra of CX377 (see Table \[rvc\_table\]) are consistent with zero or less than 10 km s$^{-1}$, which is not surprising given that the three object spectra were only 15 minutes apart, and the orbital period of CX377 is expected to be much longer than 15 minutes for an F6 main sequence star filling its Roche lobe. Then we cross-correlated the object spectra to the F6V star template (HD 16673). The radial velocities relative to the star template range from $-50$ to $-20$ km s$^{-1}$. The radial velocity of the star template itself is consistent with zero ($-4\pm5$ km s$^{-1}$). The light curve of CX377 obtained in July 2010 only shows non-periodic flickering with a RMS scatter of 0.06 magnitude (see Fig. A2 of Torres et al. 2014). The strength of DIB $\lambda5780$ (EW $= 1093\pm86$ mÅ) in the spectra of CX377 corresponds to $A_K=0.73\pm0.06$. Extinction map from Gonzalez et al. (2012) gives $A_K=0.72\pm0.15$ for CX377, which is consistent with the extinction derived above. Therefore, it is likely that CX377 resides in the Galactic Bulge.

The neutral hydrogen column density, $N_H=(1.44\pm0.14)\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, was estimated from the extinction following the relation in G[ü]{}ver & [Ö]{}zel (2009). CX377 has 7 counts in the 0.3–8 keV band in the 2 ks exposure. Assuming an absorbed power

Table \[tab:sys\], first row, contains the relevant parameters of the unbinned likelihood (Fig. \[fig:likeplots\]), in the form $\mu\pm\sigma$. $\mu$ is the $S$ value for which $L_u$ is maximal, if one allows also $S<0$ values. It describes the form of the likelihood, but is not used in the determination of the final result.

Systematic errors to $S_{90}$ are also listed in Table \[tab:sys\]. The error associated with the assumed mass and width of $\omega$ is estimated by varying the central values by the uncertainties given in Ref. [@pdb].

The greatest source of $S_{90}$ systematic errors is related to irreducible backgrounds. These also shift the location of the likelihood peak to lower values. Fig. \[fig:omegamc\] shows the background distribution by physical source. All but one of the true $\omega$ are due to the decay chain ${D^+_{\mathrm s}}\to\eta^{\prime} e^+\nu$ with $[\mathcal{B}=(1.12\pm 0.35)\%]$, followed by $\eta^{\prime}\to \omega\gamma$, with $[\mathcal{B}=(3.02\pm 0.33)\%]$ [@pdb]. A dedicated MC simulation for this channel generated 5000 events of which 51 passed all selections. This corresponds to an irreducible background of $(0.53\pm 0.19)$ events. Note that the largest source of error is the semileptonic $\mathcal{B}$ error from Ref. [@pdb]. Therefore, this source of systematics can not be significantly improved with increased simulation statistics.

A second irreducible background comes from $D_{\mathrm s}\to\omega X$ events. Zero events are found in the MC events from the direct decay ${D^+_{\mathrm s}}\to\omega \pi^+$. The $c\bar{c}$ MC significantly underestimates the $(D_{\mathrm s}\to\omega X)$ yield, which is 0.6% in the $c\bar{c}$ MC but 6.1% in data [@roches]. The decay ${D^+_{\mathrm s}}\to\omega\pi^+$ is in the $c\bar{c}$ MC, but no other $\omega n(\pi)$ decays. A dedicated MC for ${D^+_{\mathrm s}}\to\omega\

In this case, the prior-knowledge that we provide to the EVGP is a simple linear function $h(x, {{ {\boldsymbol{\beta}} }}) = x \beta_1 + \beta_2$. Figure \[fig:evgp\_estimate\] shows how we can use the prior in order to control the global shape of the function. The figure shows how the EGP and EVGP models use the prior knowledge to fit the global behavior of the data (linear) while using the kernels to model the local non-linear behavior.

Learning system dynamics
------------------------

We evaluated the performance of the EVGP model in learning system dynamics using data obtained from simulations of the Pendulum, Cartpole and Acrobot systems. Concretely, we evaluated the accuracy of the EVGP model with IF and IFG priors in predicting the next state of the system given the current control inputs and state.

**Data:** to evaluate the difference in generalization, we sampled two different datasets for each system: one for training and one for testing. The datasets were sampled by simulating the system using random initial states ${{{ {\boldsymbol{z}} }}}_{[0]} \sim \alpha \; {{ { {\cal U} { \left( -1, 1 \right) } } }}$ and random control inputs ${{ {\boldsymbol{u}} }}_{[t]} \sim \eta   \; { {\cal N} \left( 0, 1 \right) }$ drawn from uniform and normal distributions, respectively. Table \[table:sample\_scales\] shows the values of the scales ($\alpha, \eta$) that were used to sample the trajectories. These values were chosen in order to cover at least the range ($-\pi, \pi$) for the angles on the systems. In Table \[table:sample\_scales\], $H$ refers to the number of sampled trajectories, ${\left\lvert {{\cal D}}\right\rvert}$ refers to the total number of samples. All trajectories were sampled for 100 time steps and ${\Delta{t}}=0.03 s$.

**Baseline:** we compare the EVGP model with a standard VGP model, a residual VGP (RES-VGP), and a residual Deep Bayesian Neural Network (RES-DBNN). The VGP model is based on [@hensman2013gaussian] and uses a zero mean prior. The residual VGP and DBNN models assume the system can be approximated as ${{{ {\boldsymbol{

The magnetic moment of the particles scales cubically with their radius. Therefore, our larger particles feature an eightfold magnetic moment when compared to the smaller particles. Thus, for identical configurations of larger particles, the resulting magnetic forces are $64$-times as strong as for the smaller particles, see Eq. (\[eq\_F\_magn\_dipole\]). In our linearly elastic description, a $64$-times stronger force implies equally increased magnitudes of deformation. We therefore need to rescale our calculated quantities $u_{00}^{\bot}$, $u_{20}^{\bot}$, and $u^{\varphi}_{10}$ to make our results for different values of $x$ comparable with each other. As a divisor for rescaling, we use $$\begin{aligned}
\lefteqn{\hspace{-.5cm}\frac{1}{N^2m^2}\sum_{i=1}^N\sum_{j=1}^N m_i m_j} 
\nonumber\\[.1cm]

\frac{1}{N^2m^2}

&=&
x^2+2x(1-x)8+(1-x)^2 8^2

&=&
(8-7x)^2,
\label{eq_rescale}\end{aligned}$$ where $N$ denotes the total number of particles, $m_i=|\mathbf{m}_i|$, $m_j=|\mathbf{m}_j|$, $m$ is the magnitude of the magnetic moment of the smaller particles, while $i$ and $j$ label all particles, starting with the smaller ones. The rescaled quantities are denoted as $\tilde{u}_{00}^{\bot}$, $\tilde{u}_{20}^{\bot}$, and $\tilde{u}^{\varphi}_{10}$.

Along these lines, we now analyze the deform

All drift tubes assembled in the chamber have to fulfil stringent quality criteria, including a gas leak rate at 3 bar below $10^{-8}$ bar$\;\cdot\;$l/s, a wire tension within $2\%$ of the nominal value and HV stability requirements.

For the assembly of the chamber [@TDR], the tubes of each layer are positioned with a precision of $4~\mu$m (rms) on combs installed on a granite table in a climatized clean room (see Figs. \[BOS\] and \[assembly\]). Subsequent tube layers are glued to the space frame which is positioned above the combs with an accuracy of $\pm 5~\mu$m monitored by optical measuring devices (see Fig. \[assembly\]).

The wire positions in the prototype chamber have been measured at CERN [@Xtomo] with an accuracy of about $5~\mu$m (rms) by scanning the tube ends with stereo X-ray sources. The distributions of the residuals of the measured wire coordinates y and z with respect to the expected wire grid are shown in Fig. \[Xray\]. A wire positioning accuracy of better than $18~\mu$m (rms) has been achieved for one of the largest chambers in the ATLAS muon spectrometer.

The prototype chamber has been tested in a 300 GeV muon beam at CERN fully equipped with readout electronics using as drift gas Ar:CO${}_2$ $(93:7)$ at 3 bar chosen to prevent ageing of the drift tubes under LHC conditions. Using a silicon strip detector telescope [@silicon] as external reference, the space to drift-time relationship and the position resolution as a function of the drift distance were determined (see Fig. \[resol\]) giving an average single-tube resolution of $70~\mu$m (rms). This r-t-relation was applied to the other drift tubes in the

While the crucial importance of disorder for the dynamics of higher-dimensional DWs is well established, resulting in phenomena such as the Barkhausen effect [@DUR-06], majority of studies of DW motion in systems with nanostrip/wire geometry neglect disorder effects. This applies to both theoretical studies and interpretations of experimental results. Some exceptions include studies demonstrating enhanced DW propagation due to roughness of the edges of the strip [@NAK-03; @MAR-12]. Recently also the effect of spatially varying saturation magnetization $M_s$ on the dynamics of vortex walls was studied, resulting in an effective damping increasing with the disorder strength [@MIN-10]. Similar spatially distributed disorder has also been studied in a simplified, line-based model of a transverse DW [@LAU-10; @LAU-11]. Experimental studies of DW dynamics in wires have revealed its stochastic nature in the case of short current pulses [@MEI-07], and has been attributed to the presence of disorder in the samples, in combination with thermal effects. For longer current pulses, the resulting average DW velocities have been shown to be quite low [@KLA-05], likely due to pinning effects induced by structural disorder. Dynamical pinning effects have also been observed in experiments of field-driven vortex wall dynamics [@TAN-08; @JIA-10]. However, despite of these advances, many details of the disorder effects on DW dynamics in nanostructures remain to be clarified.

In this Letter, we consider by micromagnetic simulations the effect of disorder on the field and current-driven dynamics of a transverse DW in a narrow and thin Permalloy strip. Disorder is modelled by including randomly positioned small non-magnetic regions (voids) in the system. Our results show that the field and current-driven DW dynamics exhibit remarkable differences which are only revealed in the presence of disorder. In particular, we identify two fundamentally different DW pinning mechanisms acting in a field-driven system, operating below and above the Walker breakdown field, respectively, with the latter mechanism being absent in the current-driven case. Also the Walker breakdown itself is affected by the presence of disorder, such that it is shifted to larger field and current values with increasing disorder strength. At the same time the DW velocities at the breakdown field and current get smaller and larger, respectively. Furthermore, for adiabatic spin transfer torque, the intrinsic pinning mechanism is found to be suppressed by disorder. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding the interplay between disorder, the DW structure and the properties of the

Two objects $X$ and $Y$ of a 2-category are called equivalent if there exist two 1-morphisms $f:X\to Y$, $g:Y\to X$ and two 2-isomorphisms (invertible 2-morphism) $\alpha:g\circ f \to
{\operatorname{id}}_X$ and $\beta:f\circ g \to {\operatorname{id}}_Y$.

A commutative diagram of 1-morphisms in a 2-category is a diagram $$\xymatrix{
 &  {\bullet} \ar[rd]^g \save[]+<0ex,2.5ex>*{Y}\restore
    \ar @2[d]^{\alpha}  \\
{\bullet} \ar[ru]^f \ar[rr]_{h}
   \save[]-<3ex,0ex>*{X}\restore & &
{\bullet} \save[]+<3ex,0ex>*{Z}\restore}$$ such that $\alpha:g\circ f \to h$ is a 2-isomorphisms.

On the other hand, a diagram of 2-morphisms will be called commutative only if the compositions are actually equal. Now we will define the concept of covariant 2-functor (a contravariant 2-functor is defined in a similar way).

A covariant 2-functor $F$ between two 2-categories ${\mathfrak{C}}$ and ${\mathfrak{C'}}$ is a law that for each object $X$ in ${\mathfrak{C}}$ gives an object $F(X)$ in ${\mathfrak{C'}}$. For each 1-morphism $f:X\to Y$ in ${\mathfrak{C}}$ gives a 1-morphism $F(f):F(X)\to F(Y)$ in ${\mathfrak{C'}}$, and for each 2-morphism $\alpha:f\Rightarrow g$ in ${\mathfrak{C}}$ gives a 2-morphism $F(\alpha):F(f)\Rightarrow F(g)$ in ${\mathfrak{C'}}$, such that

1.  *(Respects identity 1-morphism)* $F({\operatorname{id}}_X)={\operatorname{id}}_{F(X)}$.

2.  *(Respects identity 2-morphism)* $F({\operatorname{id}}_f)={\operatorname{id}}_{F(f)}$.

During the early stages of reactive mixing, the system will probe a wide spectrum of compositions corresponding to different Ni:Al atomic ratios (Ni$_x$Al$_y$). Locally, the $x$:$y$ ratio can be far from unity, depending on fluctuations set by the temperature and the relative diffusivity of each species. This means that the kinetic evolution of the reaction front is set by fluctuations, [*i.e.*]{} variations in local composition, temperature, etc. Thus, it is also of interest to calculate the free energy as a function of composition $c$ (which represents the Ni concentration) for selected phases. Since mixing processes involve high entropy and therefore low order, here we focus on the amorphous and solid solution bcc phases as potential precursors of thermodynamically stable (ordered) Ni$_x$Al$_y$ alloys. Here, this amorphous phase can be considered as the liquid structure of the bcc solid solution, although there are lower energy solid structures (e.g. B2) at these temperatures and, thus, it cannot be considered the absolute liquid configuration. Figure \[fig:comp\] shows the free energy surface $F(c,T)$ for the two phases of interest. Derivatives of $F(c,T)$ with respect each one of the axes give the entropy (temperature axis) and the chemical potential (concentration axis) differences. The information contained in Fig. \[fig:comp\] can be used to define the phase diagram between these two structures, although neither of these phases are equilibrium phases and thus are typically not considered in Ni-Al phase diagrams.

As the free energy surface shows, the free energy differences between the solid solution bcc and amorphous phases is small, with the crystalline phase generally being more stable than the amorphous one, except roughly for $0.1<c<0.2$, and, interestingly, at $c\approx0.9$ and $T>600$ K. Additionally, the free energies are minimum for Ni concentrations around $c=0.8$. We believe this to be an indirect indicator of the stability of the Ni$_3$Al system.

Reaction kinetics {#sebsec:kin}

We now study the reactivity of a Ni-Al bilayer at 800 K. The simulated system consists of two crystallites of Ni and Al containing, respectively, $N=313,600$ and 329,251 atoms. The Ni and Al subsystems are fcc lattices

An analogous procedure leads to scaling relations for the spatial higher-order three-point correlations illustrated in Figure 3. For ordered points $x_1<x_2<x_3$ with relative distances assumed to be within the spatial scaling range, $|x_{i}-x_{j}|\in[l_{scal},L_{scal}]$, $(i,j=1,2,3)$, we find that $$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:drei24} 
&&
  \left\langle  
  \epsilon(x_1,t)^{n_1} 
  \epsilon(x_2,t)^{n_2} 
  \epsilon(x_3,t)^{n_3} 
  \right\rangle
\nonumber\\ 
&\propto&  \left(x_2-x_1\right)^{-\tau(n_1,n_2)}  
          \left(x_3-x_2\right)^{-\tau(n_2,n_3)} 
          \left(x_3-x_1\right)^{-\xi(n_1,n_2,n_3)}     
          \,, \end{aligned}$$ with a modified exponent $\xi$ defined by $$\label{eq:drei25}     
  \xi(n_1,n_2,n_3) 
    =  \tau(n_1+n_2,n_3) - \tau(n_2,n_3) 
       \; .$$ The reason for the different forms of the exponents $\tau$ and $\xi$ lies, of course, in the different ambit set overlaps: as shown in Figure 3, points $x_{1}$ and $x_{3}$ have only the one neighbour $x_{2}$, while $x_{2}$ has two.

Equation (\[eq:drei24\]) can be viewed as a generalised fusion rule in the sense of [@PRO96]. It is easily generalised to $n$-point correlations of arbitrary order because all overlapping ambit sets can be written as a combination of overlaps $V(|x_{i}-x_{j}|,0)\propto \ln
|x_j-x_i|$, as long as $|x_i-x_j| \in[l_{scal},L_{scal}]$ for all point pairs. As shown by induction in

$p=2$
-----

We assume $p=2$ throughout this section. Now $\Gamma$ is not pro-cyclic; we write $\Gamma = \Delta \times \Gamma_2$ where $\Delta = \langle \eta \rangle$ with $\chi(\eta) = -1$, so $\Delta$ has order $2$, and we choose a topological generator $\xi$ of $\Gamma_2$.

\[p2lambda\] We have $\lambda_\eta \equiv 1 + \pi \bmod \pi^{2^f}\F[[\pi]]$. If $\gamma \in \Gamma_2$, then $\lambda_\gamma\equiv 1 \bmod \pi^3\F[[\pi]]$.

The first assertion follows from the fact that $$\lambda_\eta^{2^f-1}= \eta(\pi)/\pi = (1+\pi)^{-1}.$$ For the second assertion, note that if $\gamma\in \Gamma_2$, then $\chi(\gamma) \equiv 1 \bmod 4$, so $\gamma(\pi)/\pi \equiv 1 \bmod \pi^3\F[[\pi]]$.

Let $C \in \F^\times$ and $\vec{c}=(c_0,\ldots,c_{f-1}) \in \{0,1\}^S$ with some $c_j=0$ be given. First assume that $C\neq 1$ if $\vec{c}=\vec{0}$, so that $C\pi^{\Sigma_j\vec{c}}\Phi-1 : \F[[\pi]]\to\F[[\pi]]$ defines a valuation-preserving bijection for all $j \in S$. As in the case $p > 2$, we will define for each $i\in S$ an element $H_i(\pi)\in \F((\pi))$ such that $$(\lambda_\gamma^{\Sigma_i\vec{c}}\gamma - 1) H_i(\pi) \in \F[[\pi]]$$ for all $\gamma\in \Gamma$. If $c_i = 0$, we let $H_i(\pi) = \pi^{-1}$; otherwise we use the following lemma:

It is worth mentioning that other backgrounds like $pe^-\to h\ \nu_l\ j$ with the SM Higgs $h$ decaying to a tau pair is suppressed by the small electron Yukawa coupling, while the process of single top production $pe^-\to\nu_l\  t$ is suppressed by the small involved CKM mixing matrix element.

For the analysis and to distinguish between the signal events and all relevant backgrounds, we have constructed $31$ kinematic variables (at the reconstruction level after the detector simulation) which are used as input to the Tool for Multi-Variate Analysis (TMVA). The Machine Learning algorithm Boosted Decision Trees (BDT) is used to separate the signal events from the background events as in Ref. [@Antusch:2019eiz].

The BDT rank shows that the most important variable for discriminating the signal events from the background events is the tau transverse momentum. However, the other variables like the invariant mass of the tau

$$\label{eq1}
d\tau^2=\left(1+\frac{g_{\mu\nu}\ddot{x}^{\mu}\ddot{x}^{\nu}}{{\cal A}_m^2}
\right)g_{\alpha\beta}dx^{\alpha}dx^{\beta}\equiv \sigma^2(x)
g_{\alpha\beta}dx^{\alpha}dx^{\beta}\,.$$

As a consequence, the effective space-time geometry experienced by accelerating particles exhibits mass-dependent corrections that in general induce curvature and give rise to mass-dependent violations of the equivalence principle. The four–acceleration $\ddot
x^\mu = d^2 x^\mu/d\,s^2$ appearing in (\[eq1\]) is a rigorously covariant quantity only for linear coordinate transformations. Though its transformation properties are known, $\ddot x^\mu$ is in general neither covariant nor necessarily orthogonal to the four–velocity $\dot x^\mu$, as in Minkowski space. The justification for this choice lies primarily with the quantum mechanical derivation of ${\cal A}_m$ which applies to $\ddot x^\mu$, is Newtonian in spirit (it requires the notion of force) and is only compatible with special relativity. No extension of this derivation to general relativity has so far been given. The choice of $\ddot x^\mu$ in (\[eq1\]) is, of course, supported by the weak field approximation to $g_{\mu\nu}$ which, to first order, is entirely Minkowskian. Estimates of $\ddot x^\mu$ derived below assume that MA effects represent only perturbations of the normal particle motion represented by geodesics. These are described by fully covariant equations. In order to compare their results, any two observers would then determine each other’s $\ddot x^\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ from their relative motion and the geodesics for a particle of the same mass in each other’s frame. Lack of covariance is not therefore fatal in this respect. Other relevant points must be made. The model introduced is not intended to supplant general relativity, but only to provide a method to calculate the MA corrections to a Kerr line element. The effective gravitational field introduced in (\[eq1\]) can not be easily incorporated in general relativity (it violates, for one, the equivalence principle). Nor are the symmetries of general relativity indiscriminately applicable to (\[eq1\]). For instance, the conformal factor is not an invariant, nor can it be eliminated by

In this experiment two methods were adopted for the measurements of the MEMS in fluid. One is the frequency sweep where a spectrum is obtained by sweeping the driving frequency through the resonance ($\approx 20$ kHz) of the shear mode with a fixed excitation. The other is the excitation sweep where the driving force is stepped upwards and downwards while the frequency is kept at the resonance where the driving force balances out the damping force. Using this method a velocity-force relation can be acquired.

The MEMS device was cooled in liquid $^3$He to a base temperature of about 250 $\mu$K at pressures of 9.2, 18.2, 25.2, and 28.6 bars. Both measurement methods were performed alternately upon warming from the base temperature with a typical warming rate of 30 $\mu$K/hr. The temperature was measured by calibrated tuning fork (TF) thermometers [@Blaauwgeers2007JLTP1; @Bradley2009JLTP1] below 0.6 mK and by a $^3$He melting curve thermometer above [@Zheng2016PRL1]. A magnetic field of 14 mT for a Pt NMR thermometer was applied to the superfluid in the direction perpendicular to the plane. For 28.6 bar, a cooldown of the superfluid in zero magnetic field was also performed. No significant difference was observed.

In the normal fluid or superfluid, with a low driving force, the damping force is proportional to the velocity of the MEMS plate. Therefore, the damping coefficient is independent of the velocity, and the spectra at various excitations can be normalized to a universal curve [@Gonzalez2013RSI1] [^1]. However, when the driving force exceeds a threshold value in the superfluid, the velocity of the MEMS starts to deviate from the linear behavior. An excess damping emerges, and the MEMS-superfluid system enters a nonlinear regime where unusual behavior is observed.

Figure \[NLspectra\] shows the resonance spectra, oscillator velocity *versus* frequency, obtained at various excitations in the superfluid at 28.6 bar and 280 $\mu$K. One remarkable feature in the plot is the heavy distortion of the spectra around 5 mm/s. When normalized by the corresponding driving forces, the spectra do not overlap in the manner of linear spectra mentioned above. However, the low-velocity tails of the normalized spectra do collapse to a universal curve

Introduction
============

CoRoT is a satellite mission launched in December 2006. It is specialized on the detection of extrasolar planets and for studying the pulsations of stars by means of ultra-precise photometric measurements. The photometric accuracy achieved is 10 to 100 times better than what be achieved from the ground ($10^{-4}$ in the exoplanet channel). In the so-called long runs, the fields are observed continuously for 150 days. About 500 stars are observed with the full sampling rate of 32 seconds in the exoplanet channel. All other stars, typically about 6000, are observed with a sampling rate of 8.5 minutes. Up to now, CoRoT has discovered more than 15 extrasolar planets. Amongst them is the first transiting rocky planet found outside the solar system (CoRoT-7b), a planet of a young, active star (CoRoT-2b), a temperate planet (CoRoT-9b), and the first transiting brown dwarf orbiting a normal star (CoRoT-3b). The CoRoT objects open up a new window for studying extrasolar planets. However, the host stars of all these planets are F, G, and K-stars.

As outlined in detail in Guenther et al. (2010) it would be very interesting to detect planets of earlier type stars. For example, the mass loss of planets orbiting early and late type stars is different because of the differences in the EUV and X-ray radiation of the host stars. By comparing the properties of planets orbiting A-stars and late-type stars, we can find out what the influence of the central star for the planet is. However, detecting planets of A-type stars by means of transit observations is difficult, because the transits are shallower than for smaller stars. Additionally, many A-stars oscillate, which makes the analysis of the light curves rather difficult. In order to make progress in this field of research it is thus essential to identify the A-star first. This is the aim of this work.

Identifying candidates and observations
=======================================

Prior to the launch of the satellite, many CoRoT fields were observed using multi-colour photometry (B, V, R, I). Almost all stars that CoRoT observed are also in the 2

We now describe a class of models that provably satisfies Assumptions \[ass1IHM\]–\[ass3IHM\]. The main aim in the present section is not to be exhaustive, but merely to demonstrate that the form (particularly) of Assumptions \[ass2IHM\]–\[ass3IHM\] is natural in the context of control problems considered here. The example we give is in dimension one. But it is clear from the construction below that it can easily be generalised.

Let $A:=[-a,a]$, for some constant $a>0$, and ${\sigma},\mu, f, \alpha:{\mathbb{R}}\times [-a,a]\to{\mathbb{R}}$ be given by $$\label{eq:Example_Class}
{\sigma}(x,p):={\sigma}_1(x),\quad \mu(x,p):=\mu_1(x)+p \mu_2,\quad f(x,p):= f_1(x) + f_2(p),\quad
\alpha(x,p)\equiv \alpha_0,$$ where ${\sigma}_1,\mu_1,f_1\in {\mathcal{C}}^1({\mathbb{R}})$, $f_2\in{\mathcal{C}}^2((-a,a))$ is convex and symmetric (i.e. $f_2(p)=f_2(-p)$ for all $p\in A$) and $\mu_2$ and $\alpha_0$ are constants. For any $h\in\{{\sigma}_1,\mu_1,f_1,f_2\}$ (resp. $h'\in\{{\sigma}_1',\mu_1',f_1',f_2'\}$) let the positive constant $C_h$ (resp. $C_h'$) satisfy $|h|\leq C_h$ (resp. $|h'|\leq C_h'$). In particular, we assume that the derivatives of ${\sigma}_1,\mu_1,f_1,f_2$ are bounded. Moreover we may (and do) take $C_{f_2}':=f_2'(a)$. Assume also that $\alpha_0>0$ and ${\sigma}_1^2>\lambda>0$ (so that As \[ass1IHM\] is satisfied) and the scaling function $S\equiv1$. Then

**The ShapeNet-Skeleton dataset** Training skeletons are necessary in order to learn to generate a skeleton from an input image. In this work, we prepare training data of skeleton for ShapeNet [@chang2015shapenet] as follows: 1) for each 3D polygonal model in ShapeNet, we convert it into a point cloud; 2) we extract meso-skeleton points using the method of  [@wu2015deep]; 3) we classify each skeleton point as either curve-like or surface-like categories, based on principle component analysis of its neighbor points. *We will make our ShapeNet-Skeleton dataset publicly available.*

**CurSkeNet and SurSkeNet** Given the training skeleton points for the object in each image, we design an encoder-decoder architecture for skeleton learning, where the input $I$ is firstly encoded to a latent vector that is then decoded to a point cloud of skeleton. Our encoder is similar to those in existing methods of point set generation, such as  [@fan2017point; @groueix2018atlasnet]. In this work, we use ResNet-18  [@he2016deep] as our image encoder. Our key contribution is a novel design of decoder architecture that will be presented shortly. We note that one may think of using existing methods  [@fan2017point; @groueix2018atlasnet] to generate $K$ from $I$; however, they tend to fail due to the complex, especially thin, structures of skeletons, as shown in Fig  \[fig:com\_ske\]. Our decoder is based on two parallel streams of CurSkeNet and SurSkeNet, which are designed to synthesize the points at curve-shaped and surface-shaped regions respectively. Both CurSkeNet and SurSkeNet are based on multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) with the same settings as in AtlasNet  [@groueix2018atlasnet], including 4 fully-connected layers with the respective sizes of 1024, 512, 256, and 3, where the non-linear activation functions are ReLU for the first 3 layers and tanh for the last layer. Our SurSkeNet learns to deform a set of 2D primitives defined on the open unit square $[0,1]^2$, producing a local approximation of the desired sheet skeleton points. Our CurSkeNet learns to deform a set of 1D primitives defined

From Equation (3) it results $A\geq3$. Thus $$N^2\geq\frac{3}{2}\sigma(\pi^{\alpha})>\frac{3}{2}\pi^{\alpha}$$

The following theorem summarizes a necessary condition for odd perfection.

If $n$ is an odd perfect number, then $$(\neg a\land d)\lor(a\land b\land c)\lor (b\land c\land d)$$ \[th1\] where: $a\cong (A=1)$,$\neg a\cong (A>1)$, $b\cong (\alpha\geq \omega(n) -1)$, $c\cong (N^2>\frac{1}{2}\pi^{\alpha})$, $d\cong (N^2>\frac{3}{2}\pi^{\alpha})$

We combine Lemmas 2.2 and 2.3 setting $$\left\{
\begin{array}
[c]{c} 
lemma\hspace{0.1cm}2.2: (a\implies b\land c)\\
\hspace{-0.35cm}lemma\hspace{0.1cm} 2.3: (\neg a\implies d)
\end{array}  
\right.$$ where, since it cannot be $A<1$, it is $ (a)\cong (A=1)$ and $(\neg a)\cong (A>1)$. One obtains from (5) $$[\neg a\lor(b\land c)]\land (a\lor d)$$ which is equivalent to $$(\neg a\land d)\lor (a\land b \land c)\lor (b\land c \land d)$$

Considering cases in which the necessary condition for odd perfection (6) is false, we obtain the following corollaries:

If $n$ is an odd perfect number, then $N^2>\frac{1}{2}\pi^{\alpha}$

We have\
(7) $(\neg c\land \neg d) (\cong\ N^2<\frac{1}{2}\pi^{\alpha})\implies n$ is not an odd perfect number\
From the contrapositive formulation of (7) it follows the proof.

If $n$ is an odd perfect number, then $$N^2>\frac{3}{2}\pi^{\omega(n)-1}>\

-   Cell-Wise contamination: a proportion $\epsilon$ of cells in the data is replaced by $X_{ij} \sim N(k,0.1^2)$, where $k = 1, \ldots, 10$.

-   Case-Wise contamination: a proportion $\epsilon$ of cases in the data matrix is replaced by ${\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{X}}}_i \sim 0.5N(c{\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{v}}},0.1^2{\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{I}}}) + 0.5N(-c{\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{v}}},0.1^2{\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{I}}})$, where $c = \sqrt{k(\chi^2_p)^{-1}(0.99)}$, $k = 1, 2, \ldots,20$ and ${\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{v}}}$ is the eigenvector corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue of ${\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}}_0$ with length such that $({\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{v}}}-{\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{\mu}}}_0)^\top{\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}}_0^{-1}({\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{v}}}-{\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{\mu}}}_0) = 1$.

The proportions of contaminated rows chosen for case-wise contamination are $\epsilon = 0.1, 0.2$, and $\epsilon = 0.02,0.05$ for cell-wise contamination. The number of replicates in our simulation study is $N=200$.

We measure the performance of a given pair of location and scatter estimators $\hat{{\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{\mu}}}}$ and $\hat{{\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}}}$ using the mean squared error (MSE) and the likelihood ratio test distance (LRT), as in @Zamar2017: $$\begin{aligned}
& MSE = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (\hat{{\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{\mu}}}}_i - {\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{\mu}}}_0)^\top (\hat{{\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{\mu}}}}_i - {\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{\mu}}}_0) \\  
& LRT(\hat{{\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}}},{\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}}_0) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N D(\hat{{\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}}}_i,{\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}}_0)\end{aligned}$$ where $\hat{{\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}}}_i$ is the estimate of the $

Our algorithm consists of two phases: initialization and projections onto $\mathcal{M}_r$ and $\mathcal{S}$ alternatively. We begin our discussion with the second phase, which is described in Algorithm \[Algo:Algo1\]. For geometric comparison between AltProj and AccAltProj, see Figure \[fig:illustration\].

**Input:** $\bm{D}=\bm{L}+\bm{S}$: matrix to be split; $r$: rank of $\bm{L}$; $\epsilon$: target precision level; $\beta$: thresholding parameter; $\gamma$: target converge rate; $\mu$: incoherence parameter of $\bm{L}$. **Initialization** $k=0$ $\widetilde{\bm{L}}_{k}=\textnormal{Trim}(\bm{L}_{k},\mu)$ $\bm{L}_{k+1}=\mathcal{H}_r(\mathcal{P}_{\widetilde{T}_{k}}(\bm{D}-\bm{S}_{k}))$ $\zeta_{k+1}= \beta\left(\sigma_{r+1}\left(\mathcal{P}_{\widetilde{T}_{k}}(\bm{D}-\bm{S}_{k})\right) + \gamma^{k+1} \sigma_{1}\left(\mathcal{P}_{\widetilde{T}_{k}}(\bm{D}-\bm{S}_{k})\right)\right) $ $\bm{S}_{k+1}=\mathcal{T}_{\zeta_{k+1}}(\bm{D}-\bm{L}_{k+1})$ $k=k+1$ **Output:** $\bm{L}_k$, $\bm{S}_k$

**Input:** $\bm{L}=\bm{U}\bm{\Sigma} \bm{V}^T$: matrix to be trimmed; $\mu$: target incoherence level. $c_{\mu}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu r}{n}}$ $\bm{A}^{(i)}=\min\{1,\frac{c_{\mu}}{\|\bm{U}^{(i)}\|}\}\bm{U}^{(i)}$ $\bm{B}^{(j)}=\min\{1,\frac{c_{\mu}}{\|\bm{V}^{(j)}\|}\}\bm{V}^{(i)}$ **Output:** $\widetilde{\bm{L}}=\bm{A}\bm{\Sigma} \bm{B}$

For this state, the observed metrological squeezing parameter is ${\xi_{\rm m}^2}= 0.45\pm0.03$, indicating that entanglement-enhanced phase sensitivity is achievable. To estimate the enhanced phase sensitivity provided by the PQS state, we evaluate Eq. (\[eq:phase\]) using the conditional covariance $\Gamma_{{\mathbf{F}}_2\mid {\mathbf{F}}_1}$ and the measured coherences. The PQS state achieves a maximum sensitivity $\Delta^2\phi = 0.38\, \Delta^2\phi_{\rm SQL}$ ($\Delta\phi=3.6\times10^{-4}$ radians) at a phase $\phi=0.68\,\pi$ radians. Note that this phase is determined by the choice of measurement time ${t_{\rm e}}$.

In Fig. \[fig:PLPHASEvsPCSS\] we plot the estimated phase sensitivity $\Delta^2\phi$ of the observed PQS state (red solid line). For comparison purposes, we rotate the PQS so that the spin coherence is aligned along the $y$-axis, i.e. ${\mathbf{F}}\rightarrow R(\theta)\cdot{\mathbf{F}}$ and $\Gamma_{{\mathbf{F}}_2\mid {\mathbf{F}}_1} \rightarrow R(\theta)\cdot \Gamma_{{\mathbf{F}}_2\mid {\mathbf{F}}_1} \cdot R(\theta)^{T}$, where $\arctan\theta\equiv{F_y}/{F_z}$. We compare this with the sensitivity of a PCSS with input spin coherence ${\ensuremath{\langle{F_y}\rangle}}={N_{\rm A}}$ (blue dashed line), and an *ideal* single-variable spin squeezed state (SSS) that would be produced by a single instantaneous quantum non-demolition measurement with the same precision, i.e. with $\Delta^2{F_y}= {\ensuremath{\langle{N_{\rm A}}\rangle}}$, $\Delta^2{F_z}$ reduced by a factor $1/(1+g^2{N_{\rm L}}{N_{\rm A}}/2)$, and input coherence ${\ensuremath{\langle{F_y}\rangle}}={\eta_{\rm sc}}{N_{\rm A}}$ (green dot-dashed line).

We also plot the calculated *enhancement* in phase sensitivity $\Delta^2\phi$ of both the PQS and

The properties \[prop:LTRO:LowUp\] and \[prop:LTRO:AdditionOfConstant\] are proved in [@2017DeBock]. Hence, we only prove the remaining properties.

1.  By the conjugacy of ${\underline{Q}}$ and ${\overline{Q}}$, $$\begin{aligned}
                    [{\overline{Q}}{\mathbb{I}_{x}}](x)
                    &= \left[{\overline{Q}}\left( 1 - \sum_{z \neq x} {\mathbb{I}_{z}} \right)\right](x)
                    = - \left[{\underline{Q}}\left( -1 + \sum_{z \neq x} {\mathbb{I}_{z}} \right)\right](x) \\

Define $(t_1, \dots, t_c) = \mathbf{t}\in \{0, 1, \dots, p-1\}^c$ to be the least vector such that $f^{\mathbf{t}}g^p \in \mathfrak{m}^{[q]}$, in the sense that if $\mathbf{s} = (s_1, \dots, s_c)$ with $s_j \le t_j$ for all $j$ and $s_\ell < t_\ell$ for at least one $\ell$, then $f^\mathbf{s}g^p \not\in \mathfrak{m}^{[q]}$. Note that $\mathbf{t}$ exists since $f^{p-1}g^p \in \mathfrak{m}^{[q]}$, and furthermore at least one $t_j \ne 0$ since $g \not\in \mathfrak{m}^{[q/p]}$ (as $[g/x^{q/p}] \ne 0)$ and thus $g^p \not\in \mathfrak{m}^{[q]}$. Without loss of generality, we assume $t_1 \ne 0$. For $1 \le j \le c$ write $$\hat{f_j} = \prod_{i \in \mathcal{C}} f_i, \;\text{where $\mathcal{C} = \{ i \in \{1, \dots, c\} \,|\, i \ne j \text{ and } t_i > 0\}$.}$$ Let $\mathbf{t'} = (t_1 -1, t_2, \dots, t_c)$; we know $f^\mathbf{t'}g^p \not\in \mathfrak{m}^{[q]}$ by definition of $\mathbf{t}$.

$f^\mathbf{t'}g^p \in (\mathfrak{m}^{[q]}: \mathrm{Jac}(R))$.

Define $\mathbf{t}^*$ by $\mathbf{t}^*_j = \max\{t_j - 1, 0\}$ for $1 \le j \le c$. If $\partial_i$ is the partial derivative with respect to $x_i$, then $\partial_i(\mathfrak{m}^{[q]}) \subseteq \mathfrak{m}^{[q]}$ for all $i$ and so $$\begin{aligned}

Main results {#section_main}
============

Given an $n\times m$ matrix $A$, a *minor* of $A$ with *order* $k$ (or $k$-*minor*, for short) is the determinant of a $k\times k$ submatrix obtained from $A$ by removing some of its rows and columns. A *system of polynomial equations* is a set of simultaneous equations $\{p_1(\vec{x})=\ldots =p_m(\vec{x})=0\}$ where $p_i(\vec{x})$, $1\leq i\leq m$, is a polynomial with rational coefficients in several variables $\vec{x}=[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$. A *solution* of a system of polynomial equations is a set of values for $\vec{x}$ which make all equations true.

The first idea we use in our algorithm is the well-known (yet often forgotten) *determinantal rank* of a matrix, i.e., the order of its largest non-vanishing minor. More precisely, we use the fact that the rank of a matrix $A$ is equal to the largest order of any non-zero minor of $A$:

\[fact1\] For any matrix $A$, $\operatorname{rank}(A)= r$ if and only if all $(r+1)$-minors of $A$ are 0 and not all $r$-minors of $A$ are 0.

The second idea we use concerns the solution of a system of polynomial equations. It follows from the Tarski-Seidenberg theorem [@tarski] that the problem of determining whether a system of polynomial equations has a real solution is decidable:

\[fact2\] It can be determined in finite time whether a system of polynomial equations $\{p_1(\vec{x})=\ldots =p_m(\vec{x})=0\}$ has a real solution.

There are several *tour de force* algorithms for finding the solution of a system of polynomial equations in finite time, if one exists. These include Collins’ algorithm for cylindrical algebraic decomposition [@collins], Buchberger’s algorithm for computing Gröbner bases [@buchberger], and the critical points method of Grigorev and Vorobjov [@grigorev]. See [@basu] for a detailed survey of algorithms and complexity results on solving systems of polynomial equations. Such

Since the release of our e-print proving ‘no partial erasure’ theorem a ‘no-splitting theorem’ for quantum information has been presented  [@Zho05], where ‘no splitting’ refers to the impossibility of splitting a qubit $|\theta,\phi\rangle$ into a product state  $|\theta\rangle|\phi\rangle$ with one qubit representing the $\theta$ information and the other representing the $\phi$ information. Here we show that the no-splitting follows from Theorem \[theorem:arbitrary\].

\[corollary:nosplitting\] No-partial erasure theorem implies a no-splitting of quantum information.

Suppose quantum information can be split. Then there exists an operation that transforms $$|\theta, \phi \rangle \mapsto |\theta \rangle |\phi \rangle.$$ We can append an ancillary qubit in a specific state and swap with the second qubit, then trace to eliminate all information about $\phi$. Thus splitting implies partial erasure, which contradicts Theorem \[theorem:arbitrary\]. Hence, it is impossible to split quantum information.

No-partial erasure of spin coherent state
=========================================

Our theorem that no partial erasure of qudits is possible is important because quantum information is clearly not only conserved but also indivisible. However, the ‘no partial erasure’ theorem yields another important result for erasure of spin coherent states, also known as SU(2) coherent states [@Are72; @gilm72; @perel72].

The SU(2) coherent states are a generalization of qubits, which can be thought of as spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ states, to states of higher spin $j$. The SU(2) raising and lowering operators are $\hat{J}_+$ and $\hat{J}_-$, respectively, and their commutator $$[\hat{J}_+,\hat{J}_-]=2\hat{J}_z$$ yields the weight operator $\hat{J}_z$ with spectrum $$\{m;-j \leq m \leq j\}$$ and integer spacing between successive values of $m$. The weight basis is $|j\,m\rangle$ with $j(j+1)$ the eigenvalue for states in the $j^\text{th}$ irrep of the Casimir invariant $\hat{J^2}$.

The SU(2) coherent states are obtained by ‘rotations’

When developing algorithms to exhaustively list combinatorial objects, one of the primary goals is to achieve a CAT algorithm: one that generates each object in constant amortized time. For charm bracelets this does not appear to be a trivial task. In this section we outline an algorithm that runs in $O(n^3)$ time per charm bracelet generated.

Perhaps the most straightforward way to exhaustively list $\mathbf{CB}_k(n)$ is by the following approach:

1.  Generate all the $k$-ary necklaces $\mathbf{N}_k(n)$.

2.  For each necklace $\alpha \in \mathbf{N}_k(n)$ compute $S(\alpha) = \{ {\tau}(\alpha, d) \ | \  d \in \Phi(n) \}$.

3.  Compute the necklace of each string in $S(\alpha)$ to get $T(\alpha) = \{ neck(s) \ | \  s \in S(\alpha) \}$.

4.  Test if $\alpha$ is lexicographically less than or equal to every string in $T(\alpha)$. If it is, a charm bracelet is found and process $\alpha$.

As mentioned earlier, necklaces can be generated in constant amortized time. Step 2 requires $O(n^2)$ time to compute the set of $\phi(n)$ strings. Since the necklace of each string can be computed in $O(n)$ time (see p.222 from  [@combgen]), the set $T$ can also be computed in $O(n^2)$ time. The third step trivially takes $O(n^2)$ time. Thus the resulting algorithm runs in $O(n^2)$ time *per necklace*. Since there are $\phi(n) = O(n)$ necklaces in each charm bracelet class, each charm bracelet gets generated in $O(n^3)$ time.

More detailed pseudocode is given in Algoirthm \[alg:min\]. The function [GenCharm]{} generates the necklaces using the algorithm from [@cattell; @combgen]. For each necklace $\alpha$ generated, the function [IsCharm]{}$(\alpha)$ returns whether or not $\alpha$ is a charm bracelet. It in turn, applies the function [Necklace]{}$(\beta

[*Remark*]{}. Without loss of generality we may assume that $r=r'$ (if not, choose another basis in the Lie algebra). Then it is sufficient to construct such an isomorphism $\phi:
U(L_c)[[\hbar ]] \rightarrow U(L_c^{\prime })[[\hbar ]]$ for the case when algebra $L$ is fixed. For definiteness, we take $L_c$ to be the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra: $$\label{GW}
\lbrack z_i,z_j]=i\hbar r_{ij}c\,,$$ whose formal universal enveloping algebra, denoted by $W$, consists of formal power series in $z_i$ and $\hbar$ with complex coefficients $$\label{GW1}
  a(z,\hbar)=\sum_{k,n\geq 0}\hbar^{k}a_k^{i_1\cdots i_n}z_{i_1}\cdots
  z_{i_n}\,.$$ Since the underlying QFL algebra $L$ is commutative the matrix ${\cal R}$ entering to the definition (\[circ\]) of $\circ$-product is equal to unit and we arrive at the usual Weyl-Moyal formula $$a\circ b
=a\left(z_i+\left(\frac{i\hbar}{2}\right)r_{ij}\frac{\partial}{\partial
z_j }\right)b(z)={\rm
exp}\left(\frac{i\hbar}{2}r_{ij}\frac{\partial}{\partial z_i}
\frac{
\partial}{\partial w_j}\right)a(z)b(w)|_{z=w}\,.$$ In what follows we will refer to $W$ as the Weyl algebra.

Now let $L$ and $L^{\prime}$ be arbitrary QFL algebras of equal dimension, then the stated isomorphism $\phi:
U(L_c)[[\hbar]]\rightarrow U(L'_c)[[\hbar]]$ can be written as the composition $\phi=\rho\rho'^{-1}$ of isomorphisms $\rho:
W\rightarrow U(L_c)[[\hbar]]$ and $\rho': W\rightarrow
U(L^{\prime}_c)[[\hbar]]$.

### High-energy lightcurve {#sec:lci}

As we shall see, the lightcurve and emission duration at GeV energies are critical variables in determining the detectability of GRBs from the ground, where the response time of the telescope to transient alerts from satellite instruments limits observations to $\gtrsim 1$ min after the start of the event, and the background can obscure low-luminosity emission occurring over long timescales. Motivated by the finding of @ghisellini10, we will assume that the GRB lightcurve in the early afterglow phase can be described as a power-law falloff. The prompt phase of the GRB can be demarcated by T90 as determined by lower energy gamma-ray instruments. Luminosity during this phase is often seen to fluctuate rapidly and unpredictably, with spiked emission features that undergo rapid exponential time decay [@piran04]. Since only considering time-averaged behavior (where the typical erratic prompt emission of GRBs is neglected) will not affect our results in term of detection rate and photon statistics, we describe this phase as having constant flux. Our total modeled GeV lightcurve then is a plateau from the burst onset ($t=0$) to $t=\mbox{T90}$, followed by a powerlaw falloff: $$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:lci}
F(t) & =  F_0 ; \; \;  \; \;     & t< \mbox{T90} \\
F(t) & =  F_0 [\frac{t}{\mbox{\scriptsize T90}}]^{-\gamma}; & t \geq \mbox{T90} \nonumber\end{aligned}$$ Here $\gamma$ is the power-law index of the afterglow lightcurve. We will use 1.5 as a fiducial value, but will also explore the impact of other possibilities in §\[sec:parvar\]. Note that for this value, two-thirds of the total emission emerges after T90. We assume no spectral evolution between the prompt and afterglow phases.

Redshift distribution {#reddist}
---------------------

The observed fluence distribution for GRBs is not assumed to be directly dependent on redshift. However, redshift is a crucial factor in determining GRB detectability because the cosmological opacity due to EBL is determined by the GRB redshift. We make the assumption in this calculation that the redshift distribution of GRBs to which CTA responds will be similar

This implementation comes as a proof of concept, and as such still has a number of limitations.

The biggest theoretical limitations are linked to the `While` loops that are rather difficult to express, and which support is limited in the current version of this tool:

-   An explicit loop invariant has to be provided for the `While` loops. However, [@Bernot2019Genetically] propose a method to automatically infer a weakest invariant with the following approach:

    -   Start with the most general invariant.

    -   Run the loop and remove values that lead out of boundaries.

    -   Repeat until reaching a fixpoint.

    Since values are finite (variables take bounded discrete values), this is ensured to end.

-   The weakest preconditions of `While` loops are expressed as formulas in a special context (`FreshState`, defining a “fresh” set of variables) which is currently not explored nor simplified buy the `simplify` function. The simplifications should also apply to these formulas, probably with the same simplification rules, but by taking care of not performing refining on variables in such a context.

There also are technical limitations regarding the ASP output:

-   The output of Clingo can be difficult to read, as variables are all encoded with dummy names. The `asp_params` outputs the correspondence between ASP and model variables, bot does not provide pretty-printing nor replace one with the other in the output. A more explicit encoding could be found to ease direct reading of the solutions.

-   The Clingo solving can be really long for some formulas, especially if there are a lot of solutions. This limitation seems hard to fix; working on the formula instead of on the set of solutions seems to be the best alternative in this case.

Finally, there also are obvious limitations on the source code itself:

-   Both model and processings have to be hard-coded in the main file, and at specific locations. A parser should be added to load a model from a file, or the main file without examples should be turned into a module.

-   Functions related to Hoare logic should be purified (they are currently closures on `vars` and `mults`, which partly causes the previous limitation).

Conclusion
==========

This paper presents an implementation of [@Bernot2019Genetically] which applies Hoare logic to Thomas’ formalism in order to infer constraints on the model

$$\Omega _{\mathbf{nb}}=\mathbf{n\cdot }\nabla \times \mathbf{b}+\mathbf{b\cdot }\nabla \times \mathbf{n}  \label{e33b}$$

of the cross-helicities for the normal and bi-normal vectors.

Let $\mathbf{J}=\alpha \left( \mathbf{n}+\mu \mathbf{b}\right) $ (or $\mathbf{J}=\beta \left( \mathbf{b}-\eta \mathbf{n}\right) $). Then, the Jacobi identity for $\mathbf{J}$ in moving coordinates is given by the Riccati equation $$\begin{aligned}
\partial _{s}\mu &=&\Omega _{\mathbf{n}}+\mu \Omega _{\mathbf{nb}}+\mu
^{2}\Omega _{\mathbf{b}}  \label{e33ii} \\
\text{(or\ \ \ \ \ \ }\partial _{s}\eta &=&\Omega _{\mathbf{b}}-\eta \Omega
_{\mathbf{nb}}+\eta ^{2}\Omega _{\mathbf{n}}\text{ \ \ \ \ with \ \ }\mu
=-1/\eta \text{)}\end{aligned}$$

Thus, in the moving coordinates, the Jacobi identity or, equivalently, the existence of Poisson structure is expressible as a differential equation in arclength coordinates only. It may be interesting to note that the equation named after Jacopo Francesco Riccati originated from his investigations of curves whose radii of curvature depend only on a single variable [@ince]. The disappearence of the moving coordinates $n$ and $b$ from the Jacobi identity will become clear in the last section. In fact, they correspond to local conserved quantities and, as discussed in [@hasan] for the globally integrable cases, may appear arbitrarily in the Poisson vectors.

The Riccati equation $\left( \ref{e33ii}\right) $ is equivalent to the linear second order equation $$\begin{aligned}
\partial _{ss}^{2}u-\left( \frac{\partial _{s}\Omega _{\mathbf{b}}}{\Omega _{\mathbf{b}}}+\Omega _{\mathbf{nb}}\right) \partial _{s}u+\Omega _{\mathbf{n}}\Omega _{\mathbf{b}}u &=&0\text{\ \ \ if }\ \Omega _{\mathbf{b}}\neq 0
\label{e34} \\

Equipped with the data from the microcanonical simulations and this convolution routine, we compute the wrapping probability functions $R_L(\eta)$ for various system sizes $L$ and shapes. Like [@newman:ziff:01], we look for several kinds of wrapping in particular. Specifically:

-   $R^e_L(\eta)$ is the probability of any kind of wrapping cluster. This is indicated by a winding number that is nonzero in either coordinate.

-   $R^h_L(\eta)$ is the probability of a cluster that wraps horizontally. This is indicated by a winding number that is nonzero in the first coordinate.

-   $R^b_L(\eta)$ is the probability of a cluster that wraps both horizontally and vertically. This is indicated by a single winding number that is nonzero in both coordinates, or a pair of winding numbers that are nonzero in the first and second coordinates respectively.

-   $R^1_L(\eta)$ is the probability of a cluster that wraps horizontally, but not vertically. This is indicated by a winding number that is nonzero in only the first coordinate.

For any $L$ and any $\eta$, these probabilities obey $$R_L^e = 2 R_L^h - R_L^b = 2 R_L^1 + R_L^b \, .$$ We assume here that the torus is square, so that horizontal and vertical wrapping probabilities are equal.

Note that if the first nonzero winding number observed in a given trial is nonzero in both coordinates, then a cluster of type $1$ (horizontal but not vertical) does not occur at all in that trial. Thus $R^1_L(\eta)$ does not tend to $1$ as $\eta$ increases.

In practice, we focused on $R_L^e$ and $R_L^b$. In each run, we recorded the number of objects $n^h$ at which horizontal wrapping first occurred, and the number $n^v$ at which vertical wrapping first occurred. Then $n^e = \min(n^h,n^v)$ and $n^b = \max(n^h,n^v)$ are our estimates, in that run, of the values of $n$ at which $R^e_L$ and $R^b_L$ jump from $0$ to $1$.

A beautiful fact

A deeper consequence of supersymmetry is cancellation amongst Feynman graphs (and their ultra-violet divergences) between bosonic and fermionic contributions. This is not only crucial for particle physics (e.g. as regards the hierarchy problem), but is of paramount importance for getting solutions to quantum gauge theories and strings. As is well-known, the description of the non-abelian quantum gauge theories in terms of the fundamental (Yang-Mills) variables becomes invalid below some energy scale, due to singularities in quantum perturbation theory. As a result, the strong coupling description in these theories (like QCD) is out of reach. The main physical obstruction is the complicated vacuum structure of the bosonic gauge theories, which results in the (theoretically) uncontrollable screening of charges, etc. Supersymmetry causes the cancellation between screening and anti-screening of the bosonic and (very specific) fermionic contributions, which greatly simplifies the low-energy behaviour in the supersymmetric quantum gauge field theories. If the amount of supersymmetry is enough (as it happens to be the case in the N=2 supersymmetric quantum gauge field theories in four spacetime dimensions), the exact low-energy solutions are possible, as was demonstrated in the seminal papers of Prof. N. Seiberg and Prof. E. Witten from Princeton in 1994. Without supersymmetry, instanton contributions are plagued by infra-red divergences.

We can, therefore, conclude that there is the conflict between the ‘realistic’ (phenomenological and nonsupersymmetric) field theories, which are best exemplified by the non-solvable Standard Model, and the supersymmetric gauge theories which may be solvable but are certainly non-realistic. This conflict reminds me the conflict between the (unrealistic) Yang-Mills theories and their (realistic) spontaneously broken counterparts, which is resolved by the Higgs effect. One expects that the ultimate marriage of supersymmetry and phenomenology can only happen after a super-Higgs effect of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. Spontaneous breaking of any symmetry allows us to keep control over the effective action. Spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry naturally implies the existence of the corresponding Goldstone action whose structure is uniquely determined by the broken supersymmetry. This mechanism is realized in the D-branes and M-theory, which has the promise to be the ultimate unified theory of Nature. Supersymmetry then plays the role of the universal regulator which puts strong coupling under control and eliminates un

Ride Hailing Privacy
--------------------

Traditional ride-hailing services such as taxis did not require strong privacy protection as riders could remain relatively anonymous during transactions. With the advent of application based ride-hailing, privacy is a much larger concern. Pham [[*et al.*]{} ]{}in [@pham2017privateride] propose a framework for preserving location privacy of riders and drivers without compromising on functionality. Pham [[*et al.*]{} ]{}expanded this framework in [@pham2017oride] by increasing privacy and addressing the issue of user accountability that can be abused with anonymity. [@pham2017oride] allows the service provider of the ride-hailing service to revoke a user’s anonymity should they abuse the system.

Cao [[*et al.*]{} ]{}in [@cao2018practical] address transactional privacy issues by proposing a protocol framework that allows for anonymous ride-hailing and payment for services. This system uses public-key cryptography, an online transportation network, and a third-party payment platform to achieve this. Aïvodji [[*et al.*]{} ]{} in [@aivodji2018sride] propose a privacy-preserving ride-sharing system which protects the privacy of users from the service provider during the matching phase of the ride-sharing system. Implementation of the privacy protecting protocols proposed in these frameworks will be important to the framework proposed in our paper due to the decentralization of the service provider.

Smart Contract Security
-----------------------

Kosba [[*et al.*]{} ]{}in [@kosba2016hawk] describe “Hawk" a decentralized smart contract system that does not store sensitive transaction data such as financial information in cleartext in the blockchain. This formal model allows for development of decentralized applications that utilize the blockchain without having to implement encryption within the application. This is very relevant to this paper as one of our primary challenges is securely transferring transaction data; however, Hawk is more focused on public blockchains where all information in the blockchain is generally transparent.

Dubovitskaya [[*et al.*]{} ]{}in [@healthcareHyperledger] propose a blockchain-based system for storing and sharing electronic healthcare records. In the paper the implementation is done using Hyperledger Fabric due to its permissioned nature and access control is implemented through chaincode permissions. The architecture proposed by Dubovitskaya [[*et al.*]{} ]{}is similar in nature to the architecture proposed

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION {#results-and-discussion .unnumbered}
======================

Figure \[fig1\] shows the real $\chi'$ and the imaginary parts $\chi''$ of the [*ac*]{} susceptibility vs temperature $T$ for the samples $t = 0.9$ nm (a) and $1.0$ nm (b) under four different conditions. Curves 1 and 1’ are measured at the [*ac*]{} frequency $f = 0.1$ and curves 2 and 2’ at 1 Hz, whereas for curves 1 and 2 an [*ac*]{} field amplitude of $\mu_0 H_{ac} = 0.05$ mT and a [*dc*]{} field of $\mu_0 H = 0$ mT were applied. For curves 1’ and 2’ an [*ac*]{} field amplitude of $\mu_0 H_{ac} = 
0.4$ mT and a [*dc*]{} field of $\mu_0 H = 0.6$ mT were used (see Figure \[fig1b\] for an illustration). For both samples a similar behavior is encountered. Both the increase of the probing [*ac*]{} field amplitude and the application of a bias field result in a supression of the amplitude of the real part $\chi'(T)$ and a shift $\Delta T_m$ of the peak to higher temperatures. Quantitatively the shift is $\Delta T_m(1'-1)=2.2$ $(3.8)$ K and $\Delta T_m(2'-2)=2.3$ $(3.6)$ K for $t = 0.9$ $(1.0)$ nm, respectively. The imaginary part $\chi''(T)$ is also suppressed, but the inflection point at $T_f$ is shifted to lower temperatures, $\Delta T_f(1'-1)=-6.0$ $(-10.1)$ K and $\Delta T_f(2'-2)=-6.2$ $(-8.2)$ K for $t = 0.9$ $(1.0)$ nm, respectively. This behavior is well known from other SG systems and model calculations [@Canella_72; @Barbara_81] and can be explained in terms of a competition between the non-critical linear susceptibility and the critical non-linear susceptibility. In other words, the suppression of both the real and the imaginary parts reflects the obvious fact that the $

Imagine two different Loewner chains that in the end uniformize the same hull. The prototype is a hull $K = {K}_- \cup {K}_+$ consisting of two small pieces ${K}_+$, ${K}_-$ away from each other, located roughly at $\xi_+, \xi_- \in {\partial}{\Omega}_0$. We can uniformize $K$ by first uniformizing one piece and then what remains of the other. Suppose that the local half plane capacities of ${K}_+$ and ${K}_-$ are ${\varepsilon}_+$ and ${\varepsilon}_-$, respectively. In the calculations below we keep track of terms of order ${\varepsilon}_\pm$ as well as the second order cross terms of type ${\varepsilon}_+ {\varepsilon}_-$, but we omit other second order and higher order terms. Write the uniformizing maps of complements of ${K}_\pm$ constructed by a Loewner chain (\[eq: Loewner\]) as $$\begin{aligned}
g_\pm \; : \; & {\Omega}_0 \setminus {K}_\pm \rightarrow {\Omega}_0 \\
g_\pm(z) \; \approx \; &
    z \; + \; {\varepsilon}_\pm \, V_{\xi_\pm}(z) + \cdots .\end{aligned}$$ After having thus removed one piece ${K}_\pm$, we are left with the hull ${\widetilde}{K}_\mp = g_\pm({K}_\mp)$ whose local half plane capacity is $${\widetilde}{{\varepsilon}}_\mp \; \approx \;  {\varepsilon}_\mp \; |(g_\pm)'(\xi_\mp)|^2 + \cdots
\; \approx \; {\varepsilon}_\mp + 2 {\varepsilon}_\pm {\varepsilon}_\mp \; (V_{\xi_\pm})'(\xi_\mp) + \cdots$$ and the hull ${\widetilde}{K}_\mp$ can be uniformized by a map constructed by the same Loewner fields $$\begin{aligned}
{\widetilde}{g}_\mp \; : \; & {\Omega}_0 \setminus {\widetilde}{K}_\mp \rightarrow {\Omega}_0 \\
{\widetilde}{g}_\mp(z) \; \approx \; &
    z \; + \; {\widetilde}{{\varepsilon}}_\mp \, V_{{\widetilde}{\xi}_\mp}(z) + \cdots ,\end{aligned}$$ where ${\widetilde}{\xi}_\mp$ is the location of the hull ${\widetilde}{K}_\mp$ $${\widetilde}{\xi}_\mp = g

The discovery of the anisotropy in arrival direction of the galactic cosmic rays has also triggered particular attention recently. The origin of galactic cosmic ray anisotropy is still unknown. The structure of the local interstellar magnetic field within 1 pc is likely to have an important role in shaping the large angular scale features of the observed anisotropy. Nevertheless it is possible to argue that the anisotropy might be originated by a combination of astrophysical phenomena, such as the distribution of nearby recent supernova explosions [@erlykin]. The observation of galactic cosmic ray anisotropy at different energy and angular scales has, therefore, the potential to reveal the connection between cosmic rays and shock acceleration in supernovae.

At the same time, there seems to be clear observational evidence for the existence of dark matter in the Universe, even if its nature remains unknown. A variety of models predict the existence of a class of non-relativistic particles called Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMP). These particles could be gravitationally condensed within dense regions of matter (such as the Sun or the galactic halo) and could provide a visible source for indirect detection via neutrino generation through annihilation. Neutrino telescopes are powerful tools to indirectly test spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section, provided the models for matter distribution and WIMP annihilation rate are taken into account.

In section §\[sec:ic\] the IceCube Observatory apparatus functionality and calibration are described. Selected physics analyses results are summarized in §\[sec:phys\] : the determination of the atmospheric muon neutrino energy spectrum (§\[ssec:atm\]), the search for astrophysical neutrinos from diffused and point sources, and from Gamma Ray Bursts (§\[ssec:astro\]), the indirect search for dark matter (§\[ssec:dm\]), and the anisotropy in cosmic rays arrival direction (§\[ssec:anyso\]).

The IceCube Observatory {#sec:ic}
=======================

The IceCube Observatory (see Fig. \[fig:icecube\]) currently consists of 4,740 DOMs deployed in 79 vertical strings (60 DOMs per string) between 1,450 m and 2,450 m depth below the Geographic South Pole. At the beginning of 2011 IceCube will be completed with 86 strings and 5,160 DOMs. The surface array IceTop with 81 stations, each consisting of two tanks with frozen clean water with two DOMs each, will provide the measurement of the spectrum and mass composition of cosmic rays at the knee and up to about 10$^{18}$

In what follows, we show that Ozawa’s measurement-disturbance relation also acquires extra terms due to these new commutation relations.

Turning back to the OUP, Eq. (\[eq5\]), and the relations from Eq. (\[eq2\]), one typically has for the commutative case \[eq76\] ||(\_i)||, ||(\_i)||G , where $i=\widehat{X},\widehat{Y}$ for a $2$-dimensional phase space. Eq. (\[eq2\]) then reads \[eq77\] (\_i), (\_i)G . We now evaluate the noise and the disturbance in terms of the gain parameter $G$ and show that the NC corrections add extra terms to the OUP. For the pair $(\widehat{X}_a, \widehat{P}_{X_a})$, \[eq78\] (\_a)&=& ([\_b\^[in]{}G]{} + G[ 2 ]{} \_[Y\_b]{}\^[in]{})\^2\^[1/2]{}\
&=&(+ {\_b\^[in]{},\_[Y\_b]{}\^[in]{} }+G\^2[[\^2]{} 4 \^2]{} \_[Y\_b]{}\^[in\^2]{})\^[1/2]{}\
&=& [[\_b\^[in\^2]{}]{}\^[1/2]{}G]{} (1 + 2G\^2[ ]{} [{\_b\^[in]{} , \_[Y\_b]{}\^[in]{} } ]{} +G\^4[[\^2]{} 4 \^2]{} [\_[Y\_b]{}\^[in\^2]{}]{})\^[1/2]{} . Here $\left\{\widehat{A},\widehat{B} \right\} = \frac{1}{2} (\widehat{A}\widehat{B} + \widehat{B} \widehat{A})$ denotes the anti-commutator. Let us call $\epsilon_C(\widehat{X}_a)={\langle\widehat{X}_b^{in^2}\rangle \over G}$ the “commutative” part of the noise operator, and $k_1= 2 {\langle \left\{\widehat{X}_b^{in} , \widehat{P}_{Y_b}^{in} \right\}\rangle\over {\langle\widehat{X}_b^{in^2}\rangle}}$. Thus, \[eq79\] \_[NC]{}(\_a)= \_C(\_a)( 1+ k\_1 [2]{} G\^2

As discussed in Section \[II\], the existence of degeneracies in the eigenvectors of the RMHD system of equations makes it hazardous to implement linearized Riemann solvers based on the full spectral decomposition of the flux vector Jacobians. Nevertheless, we have succeeded in developing and implementing in the code a full-wave decomposition (Roe-type) Riemann solver based on a single, renormalized set of right and left eigenvectors, as discussed in detail in @anton05, which is regular for any physical state, including degeneracies. This Riemann solver is invoked in the code after a (local) linear coordinate transformation based on the procedure developed by @pons:98 that allows to use special relativistic Riemann solvers in general relativity, and which has been properly extended to include magnetic fields (see Sect. \[SRRS\]).

In addition to the Roe-type Riemann solver we also use two simpler alternative approaches to compute the numerical fluxes, namely the HLL single-state Riemann solver of @harten:83 and the second order central (symmetric) scheme of @tadmor (KT hereafter). The KT scheme has proved recently to yield results with an accuracy comparable to those provided by full-wave decomposition Riemann solvers in simulations involving purely hydrodynamical special relativistic flows [@arturo] and general relativistic flows in dynamical neutron star spacetimes [@shibata]. The interested reader is addressed to @tadmor [@arturo] for specific details on the KT central scheme.

Correspondingly, the HLL Riemann solver is based on the calculation of the maximum and the minimum left and right propagating wave speeds emanating at the interface between the two initial states, and the resulting flux is given by $$\begin{aligned}
&& \hat{\bf F}({\bf U}_L,{\bf U}_R)= \nonumber \\
&& \frac{\tilde{\lambda}_{+}{\bf F}({\bf
U}_L)-\tilde{\lambda}_-{\bf F}({\bf U}_R) +
\tilde{\lambda}_ + \tilde{\lambda}_-  ({\bf U}_R-{\bf
U}_L)}{\tilde{\lambda}_+ + \tilde{\lambda}_-} \ ,\end{aligned}$$ where $\tilde{\lambda}_{\pm}=\lambda_{\pm}/\alpha$. Quantities $\hat{\bf F}$ stand for the numerical fluxes along each of the three spatial coordinate directions, namely $\hat{\bf F}^i$ ($i=
1,2,3$) in

We are now ready to prove Proposition \[prop:regret\_bound\].

We will use Lemma \[lem:regret\_online\_linear\] with the choices $$C_t=\begin{cases}
M\sqrt{t}&\text{ if } t< g(T)\\
L &\text{ else}
\end{cases},
\qquad \eta_t=\frac{1}{\sqrt{t}}\,.$$ Indeed thanks to Assumption \[assp:bounded\_gradient\] and the definition of ${\mathcal{E}}_{\varepsilon}(T)$ we know that $0\leq\nabla_a F\big({\widetilde{w}}(t),{\widehat{\mu}}(t)\big)\leq C_t $ on this event. Therefore, using Lemma \[lem:regret\_online\_linear\] up to a translation of all the indices by $K-1$, we obtain the following regret bound $$\label{eq:regret_beg_1}
    \sum_{t=K}^T \operatorname{\mathrm{Clip}}_s\!\Big(\nabla F \big({\widetilde{w}}(t),{\widehat{\mu}}(t)\big)\Big)\cdot\big({w^\star}(\mu)-{\widetilde{w}}(t)\big)\leq \log(K)\sqrt{T}+\sum_{t=K}^{T}\frac{2 C_{t}}{\sqrt{t}}\,.$$ It remains to control the terms inside the sums for $t\leq g(T)$. Using that the clipped sub-gradient is bounded by $C_t$ and Holder’s inequality, we have $$\begin{aligned}
    \sum_{t=K}^{g(T)-1}\Big|\operatorname{\mathrm{Clip}}_s\!\Big(\nabla F \big({\widetilde{w}}(t),{\widehat{\mu}}(t)\big)\Big)\cdot\big({w^\star}(\mu)-{\widetilde{w}}(t)\big)\Big|&\leq \sum_{t=K}^{g(T)-1} K M \sqrt{t}\leq K M \int_{x=0}^{T^{1/4}}  \sqrt{x}{\mathop{}\!\mathrm{d}}{x}\nonumber\\
    &=  K M \frac{2 T^{3/8}}{3}\leq K M \sqrt{T}\,.

 \sum_{\al\in S } \sum_{i\in T } \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_{\rho, \al,i,n}x^{-n-\al}(\log(1/x))^i$$ and say that the right hand side is the asymptotic expansion of $f(x)$ in a large sector bisected by the direction $\theta$, if there exist ${\varepsilon}, R, B, C > 0$ and, for any $\rho\in\Sigma$, a function $f_\rho(x)$ holomorphic on $$U = \Big\{x\in{\mathbb{C}}, \,\,|x|\geq R, \, \, \theta-\frac{\pi}2-{\varepsilon}\leq \arg(x) \leq \theta+\frac{\pi}2+{\varepsilon}\Big\},$$ such that $$f(x) = \sum_{\rho\in\Sigma} e^{\rho x} f_\rho(x)$$ and $$\Big| f_\rho(x) - \sum_{\al\in S } \sum_{i\in T } \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} c_{\rho, \al,i,n}x^{-n-\al}(\log(1/x))^i\Big| \leq C^N N! |x|^{B-N}$$ for any $x\in U$ and any $N\geq 1$.

This means exactly (see [@Ramis §§2.1 and 2.3]) that for any $\rho\in\Sigma$, $$\label{eqasy2}
 \sum_{\al\in S } \sum_{i\in T } \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} c_{\rho, \al,i,n}x^{-n-\al}(\log(1/x))^i$$ is 1-summable in the direction $\theta$ and its sum is $f_\rho(x)$. In particular, using a result of Watson (see [@Ram

In the literature, RKDG schemes for the VP system [@Ayuso2009; @heath2012discontinuous; @cheng_vp] have been extensively studied. They are shown to have superior performance in conservation. Our previous work on sparse grid DG method [@guo_sparsedg] focused on the closely related Vlasov-Ampère (VA) system. The solver in [@guo_sparsedg] successfully reduced the DOFs of the equations while maintaining key conservation properties. However, when $t$ gets large and filamentation becomes severe, the sparse grid method has difficulties resolving the fine structures in the phase space. It is therefore to our interest to investigate if the adaptive multiresolution scheme can achieve a good balance between computational cost and numerical resolution.

We apply the adaptive algorithm to the Vlasov equation as outlined in Section \[sec:method\]. The Poisson equation is solved by a standard local DG method [@Arnold_2002_SIAM_DG] on the finest level mesh in the $x$-direction. In the simulations, we use $N=7$, $\varepsilon=10^{-5}$ and $k=3$. First we investigate the conservative properties of the scheme. The VP system is known to preserve many physical invariants, including the particle number $\int_{\mathbf{x}}\int_{{\bf v}}f(t,{\mathbf{x}},{{\bf v}})\,d{\mathbf{x}}d{{\bf v}},$ momentum $\int_{\mathbf{x}}\int_{{\bf v}}{{\bf v}}f(t,{\mathbf{x}},{{\bf v}})\,d{\mathbf{x

Consider the third level of dynamics. We should find the probability distribution $c(\xi)$ of the fluctuating control parameter $\xi$. This distribution is normalized, $N[\xi]=1$, where $$N[\xi]=\int c(\xi)d\xi.$$ The entropy of the joint probability distribution of $E$, $\beta$, and $\xi$ is determined by analogy with the entropy associated with a superstatistical subsystem \[cf. Eq. \]: $$\label{totalEntropy}
S[E,\beta,\xi]=S[\xi]+\int S[E,\beta](\xi)c(\xi)d\xi,$$ where $$\label{controlParameterDistributionEntropy}
S[\xi]=-\int c(\xi)\ln c(\xi)d\xi$$ is the entropy associated with the control parameter distribution $c(\xi)$, and $S[E,\beta](\xi)$ is given by Eq. . We may impose a set of $m$ additional constraints by analogy with Eqs.  and : $$\label{thirdLevelConstraintsVector}
K[\xi]=K,$$ where $$K[\xi]=\int k(\xi)c(\xi)d\xi,$$ and $k(\xi)=[k_1(\xi),\ldots,k_m(\xi)]$ and $K=(K_1,\ldots,K_m)$ are $m$-dimensional vectors specifying, respectively, the form and values of the constraints. Each $K_i$ is the mean of $k_i(\xi)$ over the fluctuating $\xi$.

The Lagrange function is $$L_3(\nu_3,\kappa)=S[E,\beta,\xi]-(\nu_3-1)N[\xi]-\kappa\cdot K[\xi],$$ where we have defined an $m$-dimensional vector Lagrange multiplier $\kappa=(\kappa_1,\ldots,\kappa_m)$, where each $\kappa_i$ is the Lagrange multiplier corresponding to the constraint $K_i[\xi]=K_i$. The condition $\delta L_3=0$ yields the control parameter distribution $$\label{controlParameterDistribution}
c(\xi,\kappa)=\frac{Y(\xi)}{X(\kappa)}\exp[-\kappa\cdot k(\xi)+\mu(\xi)\cdot
M(\xi)],$$ where the partition function is $$X(\kappa)=\int Y(\xi)\exp[-\kappa\cdot k

On the other hand, [(\[e:qit0\])]{} allows us to apply Lemma \[l:normals\] to get that $$\begin{aligned}
  \label{e:piax}
    \Pi_{\text{axis}} ({{\bf{n}}}(q_i)) \to 0 \, .
 \end{aligned}$$ This contradicts [(\[e:nablaud\])]{}, completing the proof.

Proofs of the main results
--------------------------

We will prove one direction of Theorem \[t:mcvxRn\] in the following proposition.

\[p:mcvxRn\] If $u$ is $C^2$, then

1.  There is exactly one singular time $T$ (where the flow becomes extinct).

2.  The singular set ${{\mathcal{S}}}$ is a $k$-dimensional closed connected embedded $C^1$ submanifold of singularities where the blowup is a cylinder $\SS^{n-k} \times \RR^k$ at each point.

Moreover, ${{\mathcal{S}}}$ is tangent to the $\RR^k$ factor in (2).

Fix a point $p \in {{\mathcal{S}}}$. Let $k$ be the dimension of the kernel of ${{\text {Hess}}}_u (p)$, so $p$ is cylindrical of type $\SS^{n-k} \times \RR^k$. Let ${{\mathcal{S}}}_p$ be the component of ${{\mathcal{S}}}$ containing $p$; note that each point in ${{\mathcal{S}}}_p$ must also be cylindrical of type $\SS^{n-k} \times \RR^k$ by Lemma \[l:strata\]. Given $q \in {{\mathcal{S}}}_p$, let $K^{\perp}_q$ be the $k$-dimensional kernel of ${{\text {Hess}}}_u (q)$.

Proposition \[p:key\] implies that each point $q$ in ${{\mathcal{S}}}_p$ has an $\epsilon_q > 0$ so that

-   $B_{\epsilon_q}(q) \cap {{\mathcal{S}}}$ is given as a $C^1$ graph over $K^{\perp}_q$.

-   $u$ is constant on this graph.

Since ${{\mathcal{S}}}_p$ is compact and connected, it follows that ${{\mathcal{S}}}_p$ is a closed connected embedded

For Lemma \[28no12a\] we need the following. Consider the matrix space ${{\mathbb{R}}}^{V\times V}$, with the Frobenius norm $\|M\|={{\text{Tr}}}(M{^{\sf T}}M)^{1/2}$ for $M\in{{\mathbb{R}}}^{V\times V}$. For nonempty $I,J\subseteq V$, let $L_{I,J}$ be the $1$-dimensional subspace of ${{\mathbb{R}}}^{V\times V}$ consisting of all matrices that are constant on $I\times J$ and 0 outside $I\times J$. For any $M\in{{\mathbb{R}}}^{V\times V}$, let $M_{I,J}$ be the orthogonal projection of $M$ onto $L_{I,J}$. So the entries of $M_{I,J}$ on $I\times J$ are all equal to the average value of $M$ on $I\times J$.

If $P$ is a partition of $V$, let $L_P$ be the sum of the spaces $L_{I,J}$ with $I,J\in P$, and let $M_P$ be the orthogonal projection of $M$ onto $L_P$. So $M_P=\sum_{I,J\in P}M_{I,J}$. Note that if $Q$ is a refinement of $P$, then $L_P\subseteq L_Q$, hence $\|M_P\|\leq\|M_Q\|$.

Problem and the related analysis can be extended to any binary alphabet $\{\alpha,\beta\}$ by using $(x-\alpha)(x-\beta)$ as cost functional. Similarly, extensions to any finite alphabet $\{\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_c\}$, with $\alpha_1<\dots<\alpha_c$ are possible by using the cost functional $\sum_{i=1}^{c-1}[(x-\alpha_i)(x-\alpha_{i+1})]_+$, where $[\cdot]_+$ denotes the positive part. In this last case, the problem is semi-algebraic, and the theory in [@las15] still applies. Such extensions will be object of future work.

Complexity reduction via chordal sparsity
-----------------------------------------

Proposition \[orderone\] recasts the non-convex problem into SDP, thus its solution can be computed via convex optimization. A drawback of this approach might be the dimension of the SDP problem, which increases with $n$. However, the *chordal sparsity* property reduces the complexity, as described in [@lasspa; @wak06; @fan19]. Briefly, chordal sparsity is defined as follows: if the matrices involved in an SDP problem are sparse, the sparsity pattern can be represented by an undirected graph, see, e.g., [@fan19]. If this graph is chordal, i.e., each cycle composed by at least four nodes has a chord, then the SDP problem can be decomposed into smaller sub-problems (see Theorems 1 and 2 in [@fan19]), which reduces the complexity.

As illustrated in [@lasspa], chordal sparsity can be evaluated directly on the original POP as follows. Given a constrained POP with $n$ variables, such as , let us build $p$ sets $I_l\subset\{1,\dots,n\}$, $l=1,\dots,p$, with the following properties: their union is $\{1,\dots,n\}$; the variables $x_i$ contained in each constraint equation are concerned with a single $I_l$; the objective function is sum of monomials such that each monomial is concerned with a single $I_l$. We then define the running intersection property as in [@lasspa]: for every $l=1,\dots,p-1$, $I_{l+1}\cap\left(\cup_{j=1}^l I_j\right)\

-   As displacement begins (once the seventh base pair is formed with the second stator), there is an initial rise in free energy, followed by a plateau. This initial rise is a generic feature of displacement resulting from steric interference at the displacement interface, and is the subject of a forthcoming paper [@Srinivas2012].

-   Later stages of displacement, after around 15 base pairs have formed between the cargo and the second stator, involve an increase in free energy of around $4\,k_{\rm B}T$.

An unusual feature of the free-energy profile shown in Fig. \[fig\_d8\](b) is the increase in free energy towards the end of displacement. We attribute this to an increase in tension within the system. When the first bond between the cargo and the second stator is formed, the contact point is far away from the nucleotides that are attached to the surface (the $3^\prime$ end of the stators). It is therefore not difficult for the strands to reach each other at the contact point. By contrast, when more bonds have formed between the cargo and the second stator, the contact point is closer to the $3^\prime$ end of the stators. Eventually, the length of DNA between the contact point and the surface attachments gets so short that maintaing the structure causes considerable tension, which is free-energetically unfavourable and results in the observed rise in the profile.

![The free-energy profile of motor stepping for various strengths of attachment to the substrate, all using a stator separation of $7.1 \rm{nm}$. The profile is taken along the path illustrated in Fig \[fig\_d8\](a).[]{data-label="fig_multik"}](NEWF_multik_d829.eps){width="48.00000%"}

The role of the attachment of stators to a surface can be tested by changing the spring constant of the attachment to the surface. The results of otherwise identical simulations with different spring constants are shown in Fig. \[fig\_multik\]. Increasing or decreasing the spring constant from $k = 131\,\rm{pN/nm}$ by a factor of about 4 has a very small effect on the free-energy profile. The reason is that in this range the attachment spring is fairly stiff, and the less costly way for the system to come close together is to stretch the single-stranded sections. By decreasing the spring constant by nearly two orders of magnitude, down to $k

We would like to emphasize that the Steinness of each fiber $X_t$ is a superfluous condition. In fact, the condition in Theorem \[thm:DF,S formulas\], which is our main tool, is sufficient. That is, if each $\O_t$ admits a defining function $\rho_t$ such that either ${\overline }{\partial} \omega_{\rho_t} > 0$ on $\Null$ or ${\overline }{\partial} \omega_{\rho_t} < 0$ on $\Null$, then we have the same conclusion. Here, $\omega_{\rho_t}$ is a D’Angelo $(1,0)$-form and $\Null$ is the kernel of the Levi form (see Section \[sec:Preliminaries\]). We refer readers to Corollary 5.4 and Remark 5.6 in [@Adachi-Yum] for the details.

**Preliminaries** {#sec:Preliminaries}
=================

In this section, we introduce the D’Angelo $1$-form and the characterizations of Diederich-Forn[æ]{}ss and Steinness indices by the D’Angelo $1$-form due to Adachi and the second named author ([@Adachi-Yum]).

First, we recall the definition of D’Angelo 1-form, which was introduced by D’Angelo ([@D'Angelo0], [@D'Angelo]), and developed by Boas and Straube ([@Boas-Straube]). Let $\O$ be a relatively compact, Levi pseudoconvex domain in a complex manifold $X$ with $C^{\infty}$-smooth boundary. Let $\rho$ be a smooth defining function of $\O$. Denote the kernel of the Levi form by $\mathcal{N} = \bigcup_{p \in M} \mathcal{N}_p \subset T^{1,0}(\partial \O)$ where $$\mathcal{N}_p := \{ L_p \in T^{1,0}_p(\partial \O) \mid \Lev

The measured electron beam orbit in the storage ring would drift with time if the slow global orbit feedback is turned off. This orbit drifting effect makes it difficult to study the dynamic range of the BPM system. To better understand the orbit drifting effect, a series of measurements are performed.

  : Maximum orbit drift measured as a function of time using BPMs with different types of pickups. In measurement \#1, the electron beam decays from 9.0 mA to 8.1 mA in 5 minutes. In measurement \#2, the electron beam decays from 4.8 mA to 4.0 mA in 11 minutes.[]{data-label="tbl-orb_drift"}

Many factors can contribute to the orbit drifting. One important effect is temperature related. For example, the environment temperature variation can affect the BPM readings and cause magnets movement which leads to changes of the electron beam closed orbit [@HUBERT]. Table \[tbl-orb\_drift\] shows the maximum orbit drifts measured using different types BPMs in two consecutive measurements. The global orbit feedback is turned off during the measurements. In measurement \#1, a single-bunch current decays from 9.0 mA to 8.1 mA in 5 minutes. In measurement \#2, the bunch current decays from 4.8 mA to 4.0 mA in 11 minutes. The orbit drifts around the electron-photon collision point measured by S05QF and S07QF BPMs in these two measurements are shown in Fig. \[orb\_drift\]. The results show that the orbit drifts as a function of time, and varies tens of microns in about 10 minutes. More tests indicate that the drifting trends and amplitudes in different time windows are different.

where again $t_\infty = {\cal R}_\ast/v_\infty$ is the characteristic flow time in the wind. Now the mass-loss rate at any location in the wind at any time is

$$\dot{M}(u,t) = \dot{M}_0 + \delta\dot{M}\,\sin\left\{2\pi\,\left[
    \frac{t}{P}-\frac{t_\infty}{P}\,\gamma(u)\right]-\Phi_0\right\}.$$

The density is given by

$$\rho(t,u) \propto \frac{\dot{M}(t,u)}{w(u)}\,u^2.$$

The formulations for $\Lambda_0$ and $\Lambda_1$ are unchanged, except they now become functions of time following the integration over volume, because the density undulates as a propagating wave.

The result for the line ratio is

$$R(t) = \frac{R_0}{1+k_\ast\,[1-\xi(t)]}.$$

Examples of $R(t)$ plotted with phase for cyclic variability in the mass loss are shown in Figure \[fig2\], with two cycles shown for better display of the variation. The different curves are for different values of $\delta \dot{M}/\dot{M}_0$. At top is the relative luminosity in the forbidden line. Middle is for the intercombination line. Bottom is the line ratio relative to $R_0$. In the lowest panel, the horizontal line in magenta is the result when mass loss is constant (i.e., $\delta \dot{M} = 0$). The vertical green lines are for the minimum and maximum in $R$ for $\delta \dot{M}/\dot{M}_0=0.9$, as a specific example allowing comparison between the extrema in the line ratio with the individual line luminosities. All of the curves are for $\Phi_0=0$.

After the i-vector mean subtraction and length normalization, PLDA scoring calculated using batch likelihood ration which requires within-class ($\textbf{WC}$) and across class ($\textbf{AC}$) matrix. Within-class ($\textbf{WC}$) matrix characterizes how i-vectors vary from a single speaker and across class ($\textbf{AC}$) matrix characterizes how i-vectors vary between different speakers. The hypoparameters, $\textbf{WC}$ and $\textbf{AC}$, are estimated using in-domain NIST dataset.

DNN-senone-based GPLDA system {#sec:DNN senone posterior based GPLDA system}
=============================

In the previous section, a GMM is used to calculate the sufficient statistics for i-vector extraction. Though GMM is related to linguistic content, no knowledge of the linguistic content of the training speech is known. Recent success with DNN-senone for speaker recognition have shown that the sufficient statistics can be accumulated based upon supervised DNN senone posteriors [@McLarenLeiFerrer; @SnyderGarcia-RomeroPovey2015].

Figure \[fig:subfigureExample\] (b) illustrates how the i-vectors are extracted using a DNN-senone posterior approach. The DNN senone posterior approach uses automatic speech recognition (ASR) features to compute the class alignments (DNN posteriors) and speaker features are used for sufficient statistic estimation. The DNN parameters are trained using a transcribed training set. The supervised approach allows the DNN to provide phonetically-aware alignments. Once the sufficient statistics are accumulated, the i-vector extraction is performed in the same way as in Section \[sec:GMM-UBM based GPLDA system\]. After the development and evaluation data i-vector features are extracted, GPLDA modeling and scoring can be performed identically to the GMM-UBM based GPLDA approach.

SN1999cw was discovered on June $28^{th}$,1999 by Johnson & Li with KAIT telescope, $21''.1$ East and $1''.5$ South of the nucleus of MCG-01-02-001 (RA= 0h 20m 1s.46 and Dec= -6$^{\circ}$ 20’ 03”.6, J2000), a barred spiral galaxy (SBab), with redshift z= 0.0125 and galactic extinction $A_{B}^{g}$ = 0.154 mag (Schlegel et al, 1998). The preliminary reduction of a DFOSC spectrum showed that it was a peculiar Type Ia supernova (Rizzi et al,1999). Immediately after the discovery, we began to observe SN1999cw collecting data both in optical and infrared wavelengths.

Photometry and Spectroscopy
===========================

Photometric data have been reduced by using PSF technique by mean of the SNOoPY procedures (Patat, 1995), which are based on IRAF tasks. The results have been checked and compared with different photometric reduction methods, namely Daophot and Template Subtraction producing comparable results(Bufano, 2004). The resulting UBVRI light curves are reported in Fig \[figura\]. SN1999cw is well sampled, but it is clear that observations began after the epoch of maximum light, even if they cover a very long period of the supernova evolution. Light curves are characterized by a relatively slow luminosity decline rate and a secondary maximum light in R and I bands. In order to define the epoch of maximum, we have applied the method by Altavilla et al (2004), which minimize the $\chi^{2}$ value with respect to a number of templates. The best fit is obtained with slow declining SNe Ia, similar to SN1991T. In particular, SN1991T and SN1999cw have same shape and post-maximum decline rate $(\Delta m_{15}(B)=0.94)$. By overplotting the light curves, we find that the B light curve maximum occured on $JD=2451355.2 (\pm 0.5 )$ $(25^{th} June 1999)$ at $  B_{max}  = 14.30 (\pm 0.05) mag.$ Thus our observations began five days after maximum light. By fitting V and R light curves, we obtain $V_{Max}= 14.25 (\pm 0.05) mag

Fist of all note that with probability one the equation $$\frac{|P_\xi{\mathcal{E}}|}{\kappa_k}\cdot|{\mathop{\mathrm{conv}}\nolimits}(X_0,\dots,X_{k})|=0$$ holds if and only if $$|{\mathop{\mathrm{conv}}\nolimits}(AX_0,\dots,AX_{k})|=0,$$ which in turn is equivalent to $$\dim{\mathop{\mathrm{conv}}\nolimits}(X_0,\dots, X_k)<k.$$ Therefore to prove it is enough to show that the conditional distributions of $|{\mathop{\mathrm{conv}}\nolimits}(AX_0,\dots,AX_{k})|$ and $\frac{|P_\xi{\mathcal{E}}|}{\kappa_k}\cdot|{\mathop{\mathrm{conv}}\nolimits}(X_0,\dots,X_{k})|$ given $\dim{\mathop{\mathrm{conv}}\nolimits}(X_0,\dots, X_k)=k$ are equal. Thus without loss of generality we can assume that the simplex ${\mathop{\mathrm{conv}}\nolimits}(X_0,\dots, X_k)$ is not degenerate with probability one: $$\label{2334}
    \dim{\mathop{\mathrm{conv}}\nolimits}(X_0,\dots, X_k)=k\quad\text{a.s.}$$ Our original proof was based on the Blaschke-Petkantschin formula and the characteristic function uniqueness theorem.[^1] Later, Youri Davydov has found a much simpler and nicer proof which also allowed to get rid of the assumption about the existence of the joint density of $X_0,\dots,X_{k}$. Let us present this proof.

Since the joint distribution of $X_0,\dots, X_{k}$ is spherically symmetric, we have for any orthogonal matrix $U$ $$\begin{aligned}
\label{2043}
|{\mathop{\mathrm{conv}}\nolimits}(AX_0,\dots,AX_{k})|&=|{\mathop{\mathrm{conv}}\nolimits}(0, A(X_1-X_0),\dots,A(X_{k}-X_0)|\\
&{\stackrel{d}{=}}|{\mathop{\mathrm{conv}}\nolimits}(0, A(UX_1-UX_0),\dots,A(UX_{k}-UX_0)|.\notag\end{aligned}$$ Now let $\Upsilon

The DFT+$U$ calculations were done in a $p$(2x2) supercell to find possible antiferromagnetic orderings. The GGA/LSDA system has a partially spin-polarized FM ground state. A small on-site Coulomb interaction considerably increases the energy difference in favor of magnetic ordering, and results in complete spin polarization of the conduction holes with realistic $U_{\text{eff}}$ values (2 to 5 eV). With the HSEsol hybrid functional, as well, half-metallicity is obtained. The HSEsol FM phase energy is indicated in Fig. \[fig:magvsu\_pandn\] a). This would support choosing $U_{\text{eff}}=4$ eV for our system in the spirit of Hong *et al.* [@hong2012].

If the Sun were a uniform, homogeneous sphere producing energy and emitting particles (e.g. neutrinos) at a constant, uniform rate, and the observed periodicities were due solely to the eccentricity of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun, then the expected phase of decay data would be either perihelion ($\sim$January 4) or aphelion ($\sim$July 4) depending on the (as yet unknown) dynamics of the decay progress. However, most of the nuclides for which measured decay data are currently available exhibit a phase closer to mid-February, rather than January 4. Hence our first task is to understand the origin of the mid-February phase. In Ref. [@stu11] we propose that this phase arises from a combination of two annually varying effects: the $1/R^2$ variation arising from the ellipticity of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun, and a North-South (latitudinal) asymmetry in neutrino production or propagation occurring in the Sun itself, for which there is considerable independent evidence [@mas96; @stu98; @dor00; @gon00; @riv00; @zha05]. This phase shift from perihelion has been seen in the phase determinations of two major solar neutrino observatories, as described in Refs. [@smy04; @aha05; @hos06; @ran07].

As we note in Ref.[@stu11] the North-South asymmetry effect alone would yield a phase $\sim$March 10 (or September 10) due to the $7^\circ$ tilt of the solar axis of rotation relative to the ecliptic. In this picture the mid-February phase would then result by combining the $1/R^2$ effect ($\sim$ January 4) and the North-South asymmetry (March 10) with appropriate relative weights. Since any North-South asymmetry would be expected to be a variable feature on the Sun, varying during the $\sim$11 year solar cycle, this could account for the variation in phase in $^{36}$Cl between the BNL data set (from 1982-1990) and the OSURR data set (2005-2011).

As we discuss elsewhere, there are other periodicities present in various decay data that we have examined, including a rotational signal at $\sim$32 days [@stu10a; @stu10b], and a Rieger-like periodicity at 2.11 yr$^{-1}$ [@stu

Introduction
============

Elliptic quantum groups [@F] are the algebraic structure underlying quantum integrable models of statistical mechanics involving elliptic functions, and the $q$-deformation of conformal field theory on elliptic curves.

The basic object, appearing in the presentation of elliptic quantum groups by quadratic relations, is a “dynamical $R$-matrix”, a solution of a modification of the Yang–Baxter equation. This $R$-matrix depends on the spectral parameter and on an additional parameter lying in the Cartan subalgebra of a simple Lie algebra. The usual Yang–Baxter equation is obtained in the limit when the latter parameter tends to infinity. However, for elliptic solutions, a limit exists only in trigonometric degenerations.

In this paper we start a study of the representation theory of elliptic quantum groups of type $A_{N-1}$, and give some applications. We construct, using the fusion procedure [@KRS; @C; @JKMO], analogues of the symmetric and exterior powers of the vector representation of $gl_N$. Out of these representations, and their tensor products, one can construct new dynamical $R$-matrices. Taking partial traces of these $R$-matrices gives rise to families of commuting difference operators. In a special case, we recover the Ruijsenaars system [@R] of difference operators, which is the difference (or “relativistic”) analogue of the Calogero–Moser integrable system of differential operators. In particular, we obtain a simpler proof of the commutativity of Ruijsenaars operators, in the case of integer coupling constant. For more general representations, one obtains some “spin generalizations” of Ruijsenaars operators.

The transfer matrix associated to the top exterior power turns out to be related to the quantum determinant, a difference operator which is central in the “operator algebra” associated to the elliptic quantum group.

In previous papers [@FV4; @FV5], a dynamical version of the Bethe ansatz was developed, and the algebraic integrability of the Ruijsenaars model was proved in the $A_1$ case. It is likely that a dynamical version of the “nested” Bethe ansatz (a recursive Bet

Transformations of Eq. (21) for an easier numerical computation {#demo}
===============================================================

#### Substraction

Using $$\int_0^\infty J_0(x) dx =1$$ $I[f]$ may be rewritten $$I[f] =  1 - \int_0^\infty J_0(x) \, (1-f(x)) dx\;.$$ The convergence is faster, as $1-f \rightarrow 0$ when $x
\rightarrow \infty$.

#### Integration by part

Using the identity $(xJ_1)' = xJ_0$ and integrating by parts, one has $$I[f]
        = -\lim_{x \rightarrow 0^+} \left[ J_1(x) f(x) \right] 
    +\int_0^\infty J_1(x) \,
        \left( \frac{f(x)}{x} - f'(x)\right) dx\;.$$ Using the identity $J_0' = -J_1$ and integrating by parts again, $$I[f] =  -\lim_{x \rightarrow 0^+} \left[ J_1(x) f(x) \right] 
    +\left[J_0(x)\left(\frac{f(x)}{x}-f'(x)\right)
        \right]^\infty_0 
        +\int_0^\infty J_0(x) \,
        \left(f''(x) - \frac{f'(x)}{x} + \frac{f(x)}{x^2} \right)
        dx\;.$$ These expressions provide several efficient alternatives to evaluate $I[f]$, provided the integrated terms are well defined, i.e. if $$f(x) = A + B x \ln x + {\cal O}(x)$$

#### Comparison to a known function

Part of the difficulty to evaluate numerically the Bessel expansions comes from the fact that the original functions are singular at the source position. As a result, the large $k$ modes continue to be important to reconstruct the solution. We can take advantage of the fact that the singularity is known, as the density is quite close to the free diffusion case $f_{\rm ref}(r)=1/4\pi

We assume Eddington accretion for the BH seeds, so that the evolution of the BH mass is given by: $$m_{BH} = m_{0} \exp{\left [(t-t_0)/t_{sal} \right ]},$$ where $m_0$ is the mass at formation time $t_0$ and $t_{sal}$ is the Salpeter time [@sal64]: $$\label{eq:accr}
t_{sal} = \frac{\epsilon ~m_{BH} ~c^2}{(1-\epsilon)L_{Edd}} = 4.507 \cdot
10^{8} yr \frac{\epsilon}{(1-\epsilon)},$$ where $\epsilon$ is the radiative efficiency.

If $\epsilon \approx 0.1$ there has been enough time to build up a $z\approx 6$ supermassive black hole with mass $m_{BH} > 10^9$ starting from a PopIII remnant formed at $z>40$. This highlights that only a minor fraction of the PopIII BH seeds formed before $z=40$ can accrue mass with high efficiency, otherwise the number density of supermassive black holes at low redshift would greatly exceed the observational constraints. The first BH seeds in the box are distant from each other, so they evolve in relative isolation, without possibly merging among themselves. Therefore other mechanisms must be responsible for quenching accretion of the first BH seeds. Interestingly if we were to assume that accretion periods are Poisson distributed in time for each seed, we would not be able to explain the observed power law distribution of BH masses at $z <
6$ around the high mass end. A Poisson distribution would in fact give too little scatter around the median value and a sharp (faster than exponential) decay of the displacements from the mean accreted mass. An exponential distribution of the accretion efficiency is instead required to match the observed BH mass function. In addition, it is necessary to assume that the duty cycle of the BH accretion is roughly proportional to the mass of the halo it resides in. To explore this possibility we follow the merging history of PopIII halos formed at $z=40$ by means of a merger-tree code. We implement a BH growth based on Eq. \[eq:accr\], but at each step of the tree we limit the BH mass to $m_{BH} \leq
\eta~ m_{bar}$, where $m_{bar}$ is the total baryon mass of the halo

Forward Spectral Model and Retrieval Algorithm {#sect:fm}
----------------------------------------------

The computation of the spectrum from the model atmosphere was carried out using the [Nemesis]{} computer code [@irwin08], which also accomplishes the fitting and parameter retrieval. This code has been significantly validated in the past, having been successfully applied to model reflection and thermal infrared spectra of Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus; from a variety of spacecraft and ground-based facilities and instruments, including Galileo, Cassini, Mars Express, Venus Express, UIST.

The Jovian model opacity is derived from two sources: (i) gas vibrational-rotational bands, and (ii) collisional-induced gas opacity. Jupiter’s atmosphere is also known to contain stratospheric haze. The addition of haze (particulate) opacity was investigated in paper I using the refractive index co-efficients of @khare84 or a simple grey absorber. However, the effect on the retrieval was not found to be statistically significant, i.e. the difference to the $\chi^2$ was below the noise threshold. Therefore we have followed the approach of Paper I and do not include a haze opacity in our retrievals. The atlases for the gas bands are identical to Paper I, except for ethane, where we substituted the more recent, improved list of @auwera07, now also available in HITRAN 2008 [@rothman08] and the 2009 update of GEISA [@husson08]. The collision-induced opacity uses the method of Borysow and co-workers [@borysow85; @borysow88].

The spectral calculation proceeds based on the correlated-$k$ approximation [@goody89a], whereby tables of $k$-coefficients are pretabulated in advance, at an appropriate range of pressure and temperature grid points covering the entire atmospheric range of interest. The spectral resolution was convolved into the $k$-tables during the computation, so that separate tables were built for each gas at both the IRIS and CIRS resolutions: 3.9 and 0.48 [cm$^{-1}$]{} FWHM of Hamming function instrument line shape (ILS) respectively [see @nixon09b section 2.2 for further details of the apodization]. This constitutes a change and improvement over the spectral modeling of Paper I, where the ILS was approximated by a triangle function,

The simulations were performed using the [gtobssim]{} tool, which is part of the [*Fermi*]{} ScienceTools distribution, and using the same pointing and live time history and event selection as used in the 2FHL catalog. We have employed the P8R2\_SOURCE\_V6 instrument response function for the simulations and analysis and the Galactic and isotropic diffuse emission were simulated using the [gll\_iem\_v06.fits]{} and [iso\_P8R2\_SOURCE\_V6\_v06.txt]{} templates [^1]. The last ingredient of the simulations is an isotropic population of point sources that has the characteristics of blazars (fluxes and spectra) as detected in 2FHL. The simulations described here were produced iteratively and ultimately rely on the source count distribution $dN/dS \propto S^{-\alpha}$ as determined at the end of photon fluctuation analysis (see later), which is, a broken power law with a break flux $S_b =1\times 10^{-11}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and a Euclidean slope above the break, $\alpha_1=5/2$, while below $S_b$ the slope is $\alpha_2=1.65$.

![image](plot/mapsim_80m_02.png){width="1.03\columnwidth"} ![image](plot/mapreal_80m_02.png){width="1.03\columnwidth"}

Sources were generated with fluxes in the range $[S_{\rm{min}},S_{\rm{max}}]=[10^{-14},10^{-9}]$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and with power-law spectra of the form $dN/dE\propto E^{-\Gamma}$. For each source the photon index $\Gamma$ is drawn from a Gaussian distribution with average value 3.2 and standard deviation 0.7 (this reproduces the observed distribution as shown on the right panel of Fig. \[fig:checks\]). Galactic sources are not considered in the simulations since we are interested in the flux distribution of blazars at $|b|>10^{\circ}$. We produced 10 simulations of the $\gamma$-ray sky following these prescriptions and in Fig. \[fig:map\] the sky map of one simulation is shown together with the real one. Clearly visible in both maps are the diffuse emission along the Galactic plane, the [*Fermi*]{} bubbles [@Fermi-LAT

In the left panel of Fig. 1, we plot the Hawking temperature $T_{\rm H}$ as a function of the horizon radius $z_H$ for various chemical potential $\mu$. From the figure, we can see that for small chemical potential $\mu<\mu_c = 0.673 {\rm GeV}$, there exist two branches of the black hole solution for a given temperature $T_{\rm H}$, one is stable (smaller $z_H$) while the other (larger $z_H$) is unstable. Beyond these two branches, there is also another solution, the thermal-AdS solution. There is a first-order phase transition between the stable black hole solution and the thermal-AdS, the so-called Hawking-Page transition.

By comparing their free energies, which are functions of the temperature $T_{\rm H}$ and the chemical potential $\mu$, we can obtain the transition temperature $T_{\rm HP}$ for various chemical potential, which is shown in the left panel of Fig. 2. At zero chemical potential, $T_{\rm HP} \simeq 0.264 {\rm GeV}$ which agrees well with the lattice result [@Lucini:2003zr; @Borsanyi:2012cr] (Actually, we use this condition to fix $\bar{a}$ to take the above value.). When the chemical potential exceeds $\mu_c$, the unstable branch of the black hole solution and the Hawking-Page transition disappear, thus defining a critical point $(\mu_c, T_c)$. From the phase diagram, we can see that the transition temperature decreases as the chemical potential increased, qualitatively agreeing well with the lattice results for heavy quarks.

By calculating the free energy of the $q\bar{q}$ pair holographically in this frame, one can observe that this Hawking-Page transition is dual to confinement-deconfinement transition of the boundary theory, with the thermal-AdS and AdS black hole correspond to confinement and deconfinement phases respectively.

Case II: Specious-confinement/deconfinement phases
--------------------------------------------------

In this case, the warped factor takes a more complicated form $$\begin{aligned}
A(z) = -\frac{3}{4} \ln (a z^2 +1) + \frac{1}{2} \ln (b z^3+1) - \frac{3}{4} \ln (a z^

If $(R/fR)_{\mathfrak{m}}$ is not F-pure then $R/fR$ has an isolated non-F-pure point at ${\mathfrak{m}}$ if and only if the below Frobenius action is injective: $$F: H^n_{\mathfrak{m}}(R/fR)_{\le -n(d-1)} \to H^n_{\mathfrak{m}}(R/fR)_{\le -pn(d-1)}.$$

In their study of the F-pure thresholds of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces, Bhatt and Singh proved a similar result [@BS Theorem 3.5] under the assumption that $R/fR$ has an isolated singularity at ${\mathfrak{m}}$. Their methods generalize well to the setting of this paper. The relationship between isolated singularities and isolated non-F-pure points is as follows: regular rings are F-pure, so $\{\text{non-F-pure points of $R/fR$}\} {\subseteq}{\mathbb{V}}(f)_{sing}$. Thus if $(R/fR)_{\mathfrak{m}}$ is not F-pure and has an isolated singularity, it follows that it has an isolated non-F-pure point. Interesting examples of these phenomena often arise as affine cones over smooth projective varieties.

I want to thank my advisor Wenliang Zhang for suggesting this problem to me and for useful discussions.

Main result
===========

The [*Frobenius map*]{} on a ring $A$ of prime characteristic $p > 0$ is the ring homomorphism $F: A \to A$ given by $F(a) = a^p$. We say that $A$ is F-finite if $A$ is a finitely generated module over $F(A) = A^p$.

We fix notation: throughout, $k$ will denote an F-finite field of characteristic $p > 0$. Let $R = k[x_0, \dots, x_n]$ be the polynomial ring in $n+1$ variables over $k$ and $f \in R$ be homogeneous of degree $d$. Note that in this case $R$ is F-finite. Several of the definitions we provide (\[defnPairs\], \[defnNonFP\]) rely on F-finiteness for their equivalence to other definitions in the literature. Denote by ${\mathfrak{m}}= (x_0, \dots, x_n)$ the

A summary of the steps [@jssnrw] involved in the monopole calculations is as follows: (1) $SU(2)$ configurations are projected into the maximum Abelian gauge. (2) The resulting $SU(2)$ links are factored into Abelian and charged parts. (3) The Abelian link angles are used to locate the magnetic current of the monopoles. (4) Monopole Wilson loops are calculated. (5) The string tension is extracted from fits to the monopole Wilson loops. Steps (3)-(5) proceed exactly as they would in $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory.

For $SU(2)$ lattice gauge theory, these steps involve strong assumptions. Briefly, these are that in the maximum Abelian gauge (MAG), long range physics is Abelian and controlled by monopoles. Each link of a configuration in the MAG is approximated by its Abelian part, $\exp(i\phi^{3}_{\mu}\tau_{3})$, where $\tau_{3}=\sigma_{3}/2$ is the isospin generator, and $-2\pi \leq \phi^{3}_{\mu}
    \leq 2\pi$. The key assumption for Wilson loops is $$<W_{SU(2)}>\: \sim \: <W_{\phi}>,$$ where the $\sim$ sign means equivalent at long range. The Abelian Wilson loop $ W_{\phi}$ is given by $$W_{\phi} = \exp(i\sum_{x,\mu}\phi_{\mu}(x)J_{\mu}(x)).
    \label{eqn_Wphi}$$ In Eq.(\[eqn\_Wphi\]), $\phi_{\mu}$ is a rescaled link angle, $\phi_{\mu}=\phi^{3}_{\mu}/2$, while $J_{\mu}$ is an integer-valued current describing the path traversed by the heavy quark. Motivated by results in $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory [@jsrw], the Abelian Wilson loop $W_{\phi}$ is further assumed to factor into a short range part involving the exchange of neutral gluons, times a term $W_{mon}$ arising from monopoles. Thus for the confining part of the heavy quark potential $$<W_{SU(2)}> \: \sim \: <W_{\phi}> \: \sim \: <W_{mon}>
    \label{eqn_assume}$$ is supposed to hold. In particular, $W_{SU(

We now construct the spectral triple $({\cal {A}}, {\cal {H}}, D)$ over the $n$-point space $M$. In our case, $\cal A$ is the algebra on $M$ defined in the last section. Without loss of generality, $\cal H$ is taken to be the $n$-dimensional linear space over $\bf C$, i.e., $\cal H$ is just the direct sum ${\cal H}  = \bigoplus_{i=1}^{n} {\cal H}_{i}$, ${\cal H}_{i} = \bf {C}$. The action of $\cal {A}$ is given by $$f\in {\cal A} \longrightarrow 
               \left ( \begin{array}{cccc}
                        f(1)      &    0 & ... & 0   \\
                        0      &    f(2) & ... & 0    \\
                         ...   &     ... &  ... & ... \\
                         0     &   0    & ...   & f(n)
                               \end{array}  \right ).$$ Then $D$ is the Hermitian $n \times n$ matrix with elements $D_{ij} =D_{ji}^{*}$, and $D_{ij}$ is a linear mapping from ${\cal H}_{j}$ to ${\cal H}_{i}$. We have the following equality defines the involutive representation of $ d a$ ($a \in \cal A)$ in $\cal H$, $$\pi(d a) = i[D, \pi(a)].                     \label{3.1}$$ To ensure the differential $ d$ satisfies $$d^{2} =0,                                    \label{3.3}$$ one has to impose the following condition on $D$, $$D^{2} = {\mu}^{2} I,                                  \label{3.4}$$ where $\mu$ is a real constant and $I$ is the $n \times n$ unit matrix.

We now take $D_{ij} \ne  0$ $(i\ne j).$ Then the representation $\pi:\; \Omega(\cal{A}) \rightarrow \cal{L}(\cal{H})$ is injective on $\Omega^{1}(\cal{A})$.

In Connes’ language [@Co2], Our spectral triple $({\cal A}, {\cal H}, D)$ is odd (except the case of $n = 2$). For the sake of convenience,

We want to apply this theorem to our case. Observe that $\delta$ is in the form $\frac{m_1}{n}\tau+\frac{m_2}{n}$. So, $$\log{\left\lvertz-\delta\right\rvert}\geq -K_2D^6(\log n+\log D)(\log\log n+1+\log D)^3 \log V_1\log V_2$$ and then $$\begin{aligned}

    \end{aligned}$$ As we will show, this inequality holds only for $n$ small, since the LHS growth as $n^2$ and the RHS is logarithmic. Observe that $\omega(n)\leq \log_2 n$ and $(1-\rho(n))>0.5$. Since $n>\max\{70000,D\}$, then $$(\log n+\log D)(\log\log n+1+\log D)^3\leq n.$$ Therefore, the inequality could hold only for $$\begin{aligned}
    n<&\frac{1}{(1-\rho(n))n\hat{h}(P)}\Big(2\log n+C_E(\omega(n)+1)+\#SC+\\&+2K_2D^6(\log n+\log D)(\log\log n+1+\log D)^3 \log V_1\log V_2\Big)\\&<\frac{2}{\hat{h}(P)}\Big(2C_E+2+2D^6K_2\log V_1\log V_2+\#SC\Big).
    \end{aligned}$$ If ${\left\lvertx(nP)\right\rvert}\leq 2C_1$, then, proceeding as before, $B_n$ can have a primitive divisor only for $$n<\frac{2}{\hat{h}(P)}\Big(2C_

For $\modt\ \lapprox\ 1-2~\gevsq$, the  distributions are exponentially falling with slopes $b$: $\rm {d} \sigma / \rm {d}t \propto e^{-b |t|}$. In an optical model approach, the diffractive $b$ slope is given by the convolution of the transverse sizes of the interacting objects: $b = b_{q \bar q} + b_Y + b_{\pom}$, with contributions of the $q \bar q$ dipole, of the diffractively scattered system (the proton or the excited system $Y$) and of the exchange (“Pomeron") system. Neglecting effects related to differences in the WF, universal $b$ slopes are thus expected for all VM with the same $q \bar q$ dipole sizes, i.e. with the same values of the scale $\mu^2 = {\mbox{($Q^2 \!+ \!M_V^2$})}/4$. Conversely, elastic and proton dissociative slopes are expected to differ for all VM production at the same scale by the same amount, $b_p - b_Y$. Measurements of elastic and proton dissociative $b$ slopes for DVCS and VM production are presented in Fig. \[fig:bslope\] as a function of the scale $\mu$ [^2].

Introduction {#sec:intro}
============

There are two meanings ordinarily associated with the noun *paradox*. Either it is an apparently absurd or counter-intuitive statement that further explanation nevertheless proves to be well-founded, or it is a statement that is taken to be self-contradictory or intrinsically unreasonable (adapted from [@oed p.185]). Often, in the former meaning, a paradox is also said to be *apparent*. In brief, the intent of this paper is is to show that a number of paradoxes in chain dynamics are indeed apparent paradoxes, as they can be explained within a unified theory.

To this end, in Sections \[sec:dissipation\] and \[sec:shocks\], building on earlier work of O’Reilly and Varadi [@reilly:treatment] and others before them, we propose a theory for dissipative singularities in a one-dimensional inextensible continuum, which we conventionally call a *string*. The chain problems to which this theory is to be applied are presented in Section \[sec:chain\_problems\] along with a brief history of the (supposedly) paradoxical solutions that have been proposed so far. In due order, these very problems are then solved within the present theory in Sections \[sec:falling\], \[sec:folded\], and \[sec:sliding\]. Although attained in a different perspective, the conclusions reached here are in tune with those of Grewal, Johnson, and Ruina [@grewal:chain], and of Hamm and Géminard [@hamm:weight] before them. There is a common ground between these approaches which perhaps deserves further study and experimental validation.

Dissipation Principle for Singular Strings {#sec:dissipation}
==========================================

Here we

The following theorem shows that Theorem 1 remains valid for some special classes of matrices with nonnegative elements. [**Theorem 5.**]{} [*Let $M = (a_{i,j})$ be a $k \times k$ matrix. Suppose that $\exists s,l \in {\bf Z}: -(k-1)\leq s <l\leq
k-1$ such that $a_{i,j}>0$ for $s\leq j-i \leq l$ and $a_{i,j}=0$ for $j-i<s$ or $j-i>l$ . If $a_{i,j}a_{i+1,j+1} \geq c_k \
a_{i,j+1}a_{i+1,j} \quad (1 \leq i < m,\ 1 \leq j < n) $ then $\det M \geq 0.$* ]{}

We will show how to prove Theorem 5 in the section “Proof of Theorem 4”.

A variation of Theorem 3 for the class of Toeplitz matrices was proved by J. I. Hutchinson in [@hut]. To formulate his result we need some notions.

The class of $m$-times positive sequences consists of the sequences $\{a_k\}_{k=0}^\infty$ such that all minors of the infinite matrix

$$\label{mat}
 \left\|
  \begin{array}{ccccc}
   a_0 & a_1 & a_2 & a_3 &\ldots \\
   0   & a_0 & a_1 & a_2 &\ldots \\
   0   &  0  & a_0 & a_1 &\ldots \\
   0   &  0  &  0  & a_0 &\ldots \\
   \vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\ddots
  \end{array}
 \right\|$$

of order not greater than $m$ are non-negative. The class of $m$-times positive sequences is denoted by $PF_m.$ A sequence is called a multiply positive sequence if it is $m$-times positive for some $m\in{\bf N}.$ A sequence $\{a_k\}_{k=0}^\infty$ such that all minors of the infinite matrix (\[mat\]) are nonnegative is called a totally positive sequence. The class of totally positive sequences is denoted by $

The mesh, on its transfer frame, is then lowered onto the mesh frame in such a way that the perimeter of the mesh lays at a lower level with respect to the mesh frame. This configuration guarantees a good contact of the mesh at all the chamfered surfaces and a good adherence of the mesh. Finally, some weights are placed on the outside of the mesh frame and around the central insert during the curing time of the glue (24 hours), shown in Fig. \[Fig:MeshGluing\].

![Photo showing the glueing of the mesh to its frame for the single mesh (left) and the double mesh case (right).[]{data-label="Fig:MeshGluing"}](Figures/Mesh_glueing.pdf "fig:"){width="36.00000%"} ![Photo showing the glueing of the mesh to its frame for the single mesh (left) and the double mesh case (right).[]{data-label="Fig:MeshGluing"}](Figures/DoubleMeshGlueing_0028.jpg "fig:"){width="62.00000%"}

The mesh is only glued to the chamfered part of the frame. In this way, small glue excesses do not affect the stacking of the panels during the quadruplet assembly. Furthermore, a good electrical contact between the mesh and the 4 mm wide flat part of the frame is guaranteed.

After curing of the glue, the mesh is cut along the perimeter of the mesh frame and the transfer frame is removed. When the mesh is cut, its tension force is transferred to the mesh frame, resulting in panel deformations of O(0.5 mm)[^10]. Remeasuring the mesh tension, values very similar to the originals were found[^11].

While the two outer drift panels have only one mesh, the central drift panel carries meshes on both sides. The glueing procedure follows the one of the single mesh. To prevent panel deformations after the first mesh has been glued the meshes were cut from their transfer frames only after the second mesh had been glued. In this case the tension forces of the two meshes do approximately cancel and the panel stays flat.

### Front-end electronics\[sec:Front-end\_electronics\]

Prior to the assembly of the quadruplets, the fixation of the front-end adaptor (mezzanine) boards is added to the panels.

Zebra connector compression bars are screwed to the drift panel frames at the places where the front

However, a system of $ N $ Bosons is described by a trace of the projection to symmetric wave functions, i.e., wave functions that are invariant under permutations of the single particle indices. Hence the trace for a system of Bosons is given as $${{\operatorname {Tr}\,}}_+({\rm e}^{-\beta{{\mathcal H }}_N})=\frac{1}{N!}\sum_{\sigma\in\mathfrak S_N}\int_{{\ensuremath{\mathbb{R}}}^d}{{\rm d}}x_1\cdots\int_{{\ensuremath{\mathbb{R}}}^d}{{\rm d}}x_N\bigotimes_{i=1}^N {\ensuremath{\mathbb{E}}}_{x_i,x_{\sigma(i)}}^\beta\Big ({\rm e}^{-H_{N,\beta}-G_{N,\beta}}\Big),$$ where $ \mathfrak S_N $ is the group of permutation of $ N $ elements. These symmetrised systems are the subject of the review [@A07d] in these proceedings. Recent results can be found in [@AD06], [@AK06] and [@A07a], [@A07b].

The path measure $ {\ensuremath{\mathbb{P}}}_{N,\beta}$ is a model for $N$ Brownian motions in a trap $W$ with the presence of a repellent pair interaction. We can conceive the $N$-tuple of the motions, $B_t=(B_t^{{{\scriptscriptstyle{({1}})}}},\dots,B_t^{{{\scriptscriptstyle{({N}})}}}),$ as one Brownian motion in ${\ensuremath{\mathbb{R}}}^{dN}$. Introduce the normalised occupation measure of the $dN$-dimensional motion, $$\mu_\beta({{\rm d}}x)=\frac 1\beta\int_0^\beta\delta_{B_s}({{\rm d}}x)\,{{\rm d}}s,$$ which is a random element of the set ${{\mathcal M }}_1({\ensuremath{\mathbb{R}}}^{dN})$ of probability measures on ${\ensuremath{\mathbb{R}}}^{dN}$. It measures the time spent by the tuple of $N$ Brownian motions in a given region. Note that there is only one time scale involved for all the motions, i.e., the Brownian particles interact with each other at common time units. We can write the Hamiltonians in terms of the occupation measure as $$H_{N,\beta}=\beta\langle \mathfrak
W,\mu_\beta\

![The points show measurements of the isovector $F_1$ form factor at five values of the pion mass; the coloured bands are uncertainties from a pole-dominance fit to the data.

The slope of the form factor at $Q^2 = 0$ is related to the isovector charge radius $\langle r^2 \rangle^{1/2}$. The left-hand panel in Figure \[fig:charge\] shows the charge radius obtained from the calculation above. A naive linear fit in $m_\pi^2$ would clear be far below the experimental points, illustrating the need to correctly describe the non-analytic behaviour in the approach to the physical light-quark masses. The curve shows the chiral extrapolation of the charge radius, using the finite-range regulator[@Leinweber:2001ui]. The right-hand panel shows the isovector mean square charge radius obtained by the QCDSF/UKQCD Collaborations, using two flavours of Wilson fermions, with pion masses down to around $350~{\rm MeV}$; the line is the chiral behaviour in the small-scale expansion.[@Gockeler:2003ay]

Generalized Parton Distributions {#sec:gpd}
================================

The electromagnetic form factors described above are particular cases of Generalized Parton Distributions. There are two GPDs corresponding to the choice $\Gamma = \gamma \cdot n$ in [eqn. \[eq:gpd\]]{}, $H(x,\xi,t)$ and $E(x,\xi,t)$, and a further two corresponding to the $\Gamma =
\gamma \cdot n \gamma_5$ in [eqn. \[eq:gpd\]]{}, $\tilde{H}(x,\xi,t)$ and $\tilde{E}(x,\xi,t)$. The invariants are: $$\begin{aligned}
t & = & - \Delta^2 = -(P - P')^2 \nonumber \\
\xi & = & -n \cdot \Delta /2\end{aligned}$$ where $n_\mu$ is

Replacing the values of the coefficients we just calculated, we obtain $$\begin{array}{rl}
\omega=&(2q_{20}-\lambda x-\mu x^2)(x-2x^2+ax^3)dx\\
&+d[Q_1+(q_{02}-\frac13\lambda x-\frac13 \mu x^2)y^2+q_{04}y^4]+
(\lambda x+\mu x^2)dH,\\
s_2=&\frac23(\lambda x+\mu x^2)^2+\kappa y+2q_{02}(\lambda x+\mu x^2)\\
&+4q_{04}[2(\lambda x+\mu x^2)H-\lambda(\frac13x^3-\frac13x^4+\frac{a}{10}x^5)
-\mu(\frac12x^4-\frac{8}{15}x^5+\frac{a}{6}x^6)].\end{array}$$

\[p4\] Assume that $q_{11}\neq 0$ and $M_1(h)=M_2(h)=M_3(h)\equiv 0$. Then the function $M_4(h)$ has the form $$\begin{array}{l}
M_4(h)=\lambda q_{11}^3[2hI_0(h)-(3ah+\frac34-\frac{2}{3a})I_1(h)
+(\frac32-\frac{4}{3a})I_2(h)],\quad \mu=0,\\[1ex]
M_4(h)=-\frac12\mu q_{11}^3[I_0(h)-2I_1(h)+aI_2(h)],\quad \lambda=0,\\[1ex]
M_4(h)=-(\frac{\lambda^2}{\mu^2}+\frac{3\lambda}{2\mu}) q_{11}^3[2\mu I_1(h)
+a\lambda I_2(h)],\quad \lambda\mu\neq 0,\quad
a\lambda^2+4\lambda\mu+4\mu^2= 0.
\end{array}$$ Moreover, $M_4(h)\not\equiv 0$.

[**Proof.**]{} In what follows, it is useful to

From Eq.(\[2\]), we obtain the energy spectrums $$\begin{aligned}
E_{k}= \pm \sqrt{|\rho_{k}|^{2} + |\delta_{k}|^{2} \pm
\sqrt{2(|\rho_{k}|^{2} |\delta_{k}|^{2} + \text{Re}(\rho_{k}^{2}
{\delta_{k}^{*}}^{2}))}}. \label{6}\end{aligned}$$ We know the necessary condition for topological phase transition is the closure of the energy gap. When $\lambda = \lambda^{'} =
0$, the energy spectrums reduce to $E_{k}=\pm|\rho_{k}|$, it is direct to find that the energy gap is closed only when $J=J^{'}$ at $k=\pi/d$. In Ref.[@M.; @Atala], it is shown that when $J
> J^{'}$, each of the two occupied bands has $\varphi_{Zak} = \pi/2$, and the system is topologically trivial, When $J<J^{'}$, each band has $\varphi_{Zak} = -\pi/2$, and the system is topologically nontrivial. To characterize the topology of Bloch bands conveniently, we define a new topological invariant $\nu$, $$\begin{aligned}
(-1)^{\nu} = sgn(\varphi_{Zak}). \label{7}\end{aligned}$$ $\nu=0$ corresponds to a trivial band and $\nu=1$ corresponds to a topologically nontrivial band. Based on this definition, the phases of the system are classified by an integer defined as $Z=\nu_{1}+\nu_{2}$, where $\nu_{1}$ is the topological invariant of the lower occupied band, and $\nu_{2}$ is the topological invariant of the upper occupied band. However, in the following we use $Z(\nu_{1},\nu_{2})$, instead of $Z$, to characterize the phases, because we can directly read the topology of every occupied band from $Z(\nu_{1},\nu_{2})$.

[*Topological phase transitions induced by spin-orbit coupling.—*]{} When $\lambda=\lambda^{'}\neq0$, the degeneracy of the bands is lifted, and only the energy gap between the upper occupied band and the lower unoccupied band can be closed (see Fig.\[fig1\](a)(b)(c)(d)). The condition for the closure of energy gap is now modified

Since $X \overset{g}{\longrightarrow} Z \overset{h}{\longrightarrow} \hat{Y}$ forms a Markov chain, by Lemma \[lemma:jsd\], the following inequality holds: $${d_{\text{JS}}}({\mathcal{D}}^{\hat{Y}}_S, {\mathcal{D}}^{\hat{Y}}_T) \leq {d_{\text{JS}}}({\mathcal{D}}^Z_S, {\mathcal{D}}^Z_T).$$ On the other hand, since ${d_{\text{JS}}}(\cdot, \cdot)$ is a distance metric, we also have: $${d_{\text{JS}}}({\mathcal{D}}_S^Y, {\mathcal{D}}_T^Y) \leq {d_{\text{JS}}}({\mathcal{D}}_S^Y, {\mathcal{D}}_S^{\hat{Y}}) + {d_{\text{JS}}}({\mathcal{D}}_S^{\hat{Y}}, {\mathcal{D}}_T^{\hat{Y}}) + {d_{\text{JS}}}({\mathcal{D}}_T^{\hat{Y}}, {\mathcal{D}}_T^Y) \leq {d_{\text{JS}}}({\mathcal{D}}_S^Y, {\mathcal{D}}_S^{\hat{Y}}) + {d_{\text{JS}}}({\mathcal{D}}^Z_S, {\mathcal{D}}^Z_T) + {d_{\text{JS}}}({\mathcal{D}}_T^{\hat{Y}}, {\mathcal{D}}_T^Y).$$ Applying Lemma \[lemma:relationship\] to both ${d_{\text{JS}}}({\mathcal{D}}_S^Y, {\mathcal{D}}_S^{\hat{Y}})$ and ${d_{\text{JS}}}({\mathcal{D}}_T^{\hat{Y}}, {\mathcal{D}}_T^Y)$ then finishes the proof.

In view of the result in Theorem \[thm:lower\], applying the AM-GM inequality, we have: $$\sqrt{{\varepsilon}_S(h\circ g)} + \sqrt{{\varepsilon}_T(h\circ g)} \leq \sqrt{2\left({\varepsilon}_S(h\circ g) + {\varepsilon}_T(h\circ g)\right)}.$$ Now since ${d_{\text{JS}}}({\mathcal{D}}_S^Y, {\mathcal{D}}_T^Y)\geq {d_{\text{JS}}}({\mathcal{D}}_S^Z, {\mathcal{D}}_T^Z

Geometrical preliminaries
=========================

The geometry of the spacetime is given by the affine Minkowski space ${\mathcal{M}}$. If a reference point $O$ is chosen, then each point $P$ in ${\mathcal{M}}$ is represented by a vector $x$ in the associated Minkowski vector space $M$ according to . We mostly keep $O$ fixed and use this representation. The Minkowski product is denoted by a dot, $x\cdot y$, and we write $x^2=x\cdot x$. If a Minkowski basis $(e_0,\ldots,e_3)$ in $M$ is chosen, then we denote . We also then use the standard multi-index notation $x^{\alpha}=(x^0)^{{\alpha}_0}\!\ldots
(x^3)^{{\alpha}_3}$, , $D^{\beta}={\partial}_0^{{\beta}_0}\!\ldots\,{\partial}_3^{{\beta}_3}$, where ${\partial}_a={\partial}/{\partial}x^a$. We associate with the chosen Minkowski basis a Euclidean metric with unit matrix in that basis, and denote by $|x|$ the norm of $x$ in that metric. We briefly recall the definitions of test functions spaces used in [@her08]. Let $\phi(x)$ be a smooth tensor or spinor field (with vector representation of points) and define for ${\kappa}\geq0$, $l=0,1,\dots$ the seminorms $$\|{\varphi}\|_{{\kappa},l}=\sup(1+|x|)^{\kappa}|D^{\beta}{\varphi}_j(x)|\,,$$ where supremum is taken over $x\in M$, all ${\beta}$ such that $|{\beta}|=l$ and $j$ running over the components of the field. Then ${\mathcal{S}}_{\kappa}$ is the space of all smooth fields of a given geometrical type for which all seminorms $\|.\|_{{\kappa}+l,l}$ with fixed ${\kappa}$ are finite. Denote moreover the operators on smooth functions $H=x\cdot\partial$ and $H_{\kappa}=H+{\kappa}\operatorname{id}$. Then the space ${\mathcal{S}}^{\kappa}_{{\kappa}+{\epsilon}}$ consists of all fields which under the action of $H_{\kappa}$ fall into ${\mathcal{S}}_{{\kappa}+{\epsilon}}$. Each field ${\varphi}\in{\mathcal{S}}_{{\kappa}+{\epsilon}}^{\kappa}$ has an asymptote $${\

![image](fig4_noguchi){height="9cm"}

The magnetoresistance curves of the MgB$_2$ film \#3 at several temperatures for $H \parallel c$-axis are shown in Fig. \[f03\] (a) as a typical example of the experimental data. No hysteresis is observed. The $H_{\rm c2}$’s were defined as the midpoint of the resistive transition and the transition widths were defined as the fields between 10% and 90% of the normal resistance. The differential data $dR/dH$ are plotted as a function of the magnetic field in Fig. \[f03\] (b), where the peak fields coincide with the $H_{\rm c2}$’s at each temperature. The peak width, which are almost proportional to the inverse of the peak heights, is also corresponding to the transition width. So, a maximum in the peak height observed at 26 K means that the transition becomes sharp at that temperature.

From the magnetoresistance measurements, we obtained the $H_{\rm c2}(T)$ phase diagrams of six films, which are shown in Fig. \[f04\]. Error bars in the figure correspond to the fields between 10% and 90% of the normal resistance. Superconducting anisotropy parameter $\gamma_H = H_{\rm c2}^{(ab)}/H_{\rm c2}^{(c)}$ as a function of temperature was obtained as shown in the inset of the figure, where $H_{\rm c2}^{(ab)}$ and $H_{\rm c2}^{(c)}$ are the $H_{\rm c2}$ for $H \parallel ab$-plane and $H \parallel c$-axis, respectively. The $\mu_0 H_{\rm c2}^{(ab)}(0)$’s attain to 20$\sim$40 T, which are apparently larger than those for MgB$_2$ single crystal. This indicates that the superconducting coherence length is effectively reduced through the reduction of the electron mean free path due to some kind of disorder in fabricating the films. As for the anisotropy, the values of $\gamma_H$ are between one and three depending on the films, which are

Fig. 3 shows four different template spectra (K3+K7, K0+K7, G8+K7 and G5+K7) (grey curves) together with the average ($a$+$e$) spectrum de-reddened with $E(B-V)$ = 0.3, 0.45, 0.50 and 0.60, values selected to give a best fit to the template spectra. The depth of the Mg$b$ band at $\lambda$5175Å (which was the only late-type feature in the first quiescent spectrum published by Thorstensen et al. [@Thor]) and of the TiO band at $\lambda$4954Å  increase with later spectral types and are too strong in the K3+K7 combination. The ($a$+$e$) de-reddened energy distributions for $E(B-V)$ = 0.60, 0.50 and 0.45 match almost equally well the G5+K7, G8+K7 or the K0+K7 composite templates, respectively, although there are differences at the blue and red ends.

In Fig. 4 we show the result of subtracting the synthetic G8 spectrum, assigned to star $a$, from the ($a$+$e$) spectrum, de-reddened for $E(B-V)$ = 0.50. This should approximate the spectrum of star $e$. Also shown (grey line) is our observed K7 V spectrum, normalized to 0.12 at 5500 Å. The main features of this difference spectrum are the emission lines at H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ (weaker) and Ca II K and H(+H$\epsilon$), which appear strong although the signal-to-noise ratio below 4500Å in our spectra is low. Emission at H$\gamma$ is barely detectable and no emission is detected at $\lambda$4686Å. The slight deficit between 4400 and 5000 Å may be of instrumental origin.

Our spectrum is different from that taken by Garcia et al. ([@Gar]) when the sum of Aql X-1 plus star $a$ was more than half a magnitude above quiescence ($V$ = 18.68), and which displays a richer emission-line spectrum, including $\lambda$4686Å, a consequence of X-ray heating.

For a closed, finite dimensional quantum system, the state dependence of the Schrödinger equation is often removed and the dynamics are equivalently lifted to a differential equation on the space of special unitary matrices $U \in SU(d), $ that act on the $d-$dimensional Hilbert space of quantum states. In this representation, the quantum control system is given by $$\label{system1}
\dot{U}(t) = -\frac{i}{\hbar} \left(  H_d + \sum_{j=1}^M \Omega_j(t)H_j \right) U(t)$$ where $H_d$ is the time-independent drift Hamiltonian and the $H_j$ are the control Hamiltonians that capture the coupling of the qubits to an externally applied control field. Denote the controlled Hamiltonian with drift as $$\label{H_Omega}
H_\Omega(t) = H_d + \sum_{j=1}^M \Omega_j(t)H_j$$ The solution to (\[system1\]) must account for the non-commuting operators $\left[ H_\Omega(t_\ell) \, , \, H_\Omega(t_\ell) \right]  \neq 0 \, \, \text{for} \, \, k \neq \ell $ and is formally given by the time-ordered integral $$\label{time-integral}
U_\tau(\Omega) =  {\mathbf T} \exp \left[ -\frac{i}{\hbar} \int_0^\tau  H_\Omega(t) dt\right]$$ With initial conditions given by the identity matrix, $U_0 = \boldsymbol{1} \, , $ the solution of (\[system1\]) simply propagates the state by matrix-vector multiplication $\psi_\tau = U_\tau \cdot \psi_0 \, . $

The quantum gate synthesis problem is to determine the control functions $\left\{ \Omega_j(t) \right\}_{j=1}^M$ that generate a desired target unitary $U_{targ}$ at some time $\tau \, . $ Optimal control typically defines an objective function that is optimized subject to a dynamical constraint and initial and final conditions on the state of the system. In quantum gate synthesis, this methodology is employed to determine

For the second term on the right of , the argument in the proof of Proposition \[prop6a\], together with Theorem \[thm4a\], gives that, for any $q>2$ and $p$ conjugate to $q$, $$\begin{aligned}
&&{\operatorname{E}\left[\left|\left(\d h(X_t)-\Pi_{\gamma_{X_t,Y_t}}\d h(Y_t)\right)(V_t)\right|\right]}\\
&\leqslant&C_1(h){\operatorname{E}\left[\rho(X_t,Y_t)^p\right]}^{1/p}{\operatorname{E}\left[|V_t|^q\right]}^{1/q}\\
&\leqslant&C_1(h)\rho(x,y)e^{-\kappa t}{\operatorname{E}\left[|V_t|^q\right]}^{1/q}.\end{aligned}$$ The condition for $\kappa$ implies in particular that $\kappa>11c_2^2/6$. Then, there is $q\in(2,3)$ such that $$5\kappa\geqslant(4q-2)c_2^2\,\,\,\hbox{ and }\,\,\,3\kappa\geqslant(2q-2+m)c_2^2+mc_2+(5\sqrt mc_2^2+c_2C_0(\phi)+C_2(\phi))/2.$$ For such a choice of $q$, we have that $\tilde\alpha_{2q}$ is bounded above by $\kappa/2$ and $\lambda_1+\tilde\alpha_{2q}-c_2^2$ in Lemma \[lem7\] is bounded above by $\kappa$, so that the corresponding $\tau_q$ is bounded by $\kappa$. In addition, $$\begin{aligned}
&&\tilde\alpha_{2q}-(\lambda_1-c_2^2)\leqslant\tilde\alpha_{2q}+c_2^2-\frac{7}{2}c_2^2<-2\kappa+6c_2^2-\frac{7}{2}c_2^2\\

![ Characterization of the device. (a) Logarithmic two-terminal conductance as a function of the left and right finger gate (middle finger gate is unbiased). The conductance map can be divided into four regions: The single-dot regime () with a zoom-in show in (c), the two pn-double-dot regimes () and () with zoom-ins shown in (b) and (e), respectively, and the pnp-triple-dot regime () with a zoom-in shown in (d). Schematics on top of (b-d) indicate n-type (red) and p-type (blue) QDs connected to n-type source (S) and drain (D). Dashed lines in (b,e) outline the hexagonal structure of the charge stability diagram in the double-dot regimes.

When a p-type QD forms below both gates L and R, we reach the pnp-triple-dot regime in quadrant . The zoom-in shown in Fig. 1(d) shows three distinct sets of resonances: vertical (horizontal) resonances of the p-type QD below gate L (R) and diagonal resonances of the n-type QD in the middle.

The schematic in Fig. 2(a) shows the situation for a triple-dot formed along the channel. The positive back-gate voltage ($V_{BG} = 5 \ \mathrm{V}$) induces a finite electron density inside the channel. By applying a negative voltage to any of the finger gates, the electron density underneath the respective gate can be reduced. At some point, the electron gas below the finger gate is completely depleted (Fig.2(b)) and transport through the channel is pinched off. Reducing the finger gate voltage further, a finite hole density is induced, forming small p-type island inside the n-type channel (Fig.2(c)). The resulting pn-junctions provide natural tunnel barriers such that a p-type QD can be formed under each of the finger gates [@eich_spin_

The effect of the nonuniform detector acceptance is corrected by evaluating the cumulants of $Q$-vector products [@Selyuzhenkov:2007zi]. While the correction is found to be negligible for the $\gamma_{112}$ and $\delta$ correlators, there is a sizable effect of 5–10% correction to the $\gamma_{123}$ correlator.

Event shape engineering {#subsec:analysis_ese}
-----------------------

In the ESE analysis, within each multiplicity range of [$\text{pPb}$]{}or centrality range of [$\text{PbPb}$]{}data, events are divided into different $q_{2}$ classes, where $q_2$ is defined as the magnitude of the $Q_{2}$ vector. In this analysis, the $q_2$ value is calculated from one side of the HF region within the range $3 < \eta < 5$ for both [$\text{pPb}$]{}and [$\text{PbPb}$]{}collisions (weighted by the tower ), where in [$\text{pPb}$]{}collisions only the [$\mathrm{Pb}$]{}-going side of HF is used because of the poor resolution from a relatively low charged-particle multiplicity on the proton-going side. In each $q_2$ class, the $v_2$ harmonic is measured with the scalar product method using a common resolution term ($v_{2,c}$) as in the $\gamma_{112}$ correlator. Therefore, the $v_{2}$ from the tracker region can be expressed in terms of the Q-vectors as

$$v_{2} = \frac{\left\langle Q_{2,\alpha}Q^{*}_{2,{\mathrm{HF}\pm}} \right\rangle}{\sqrt{\frac{\left\langle Q_{2,{\mathrm{HF}\pm}} Q^*_{2,{\mathrm{HF}\mp}}\right\rangle \left\langle Q_{2,{\mathrm{HF}\pm}} Q^*_{2,\text{trk}}\right\rangle}{\left\langle Q_{2,{\mathrm{HF}\mp}} Q^*_{2,\text{trk}}\right\rangle} }},
\label{v2_SP}$$

where particles from the HF are selected from the same region as particle $c$ in the $\gamma_{112}$ correlator.

In [$\text{PbPb}$]{}collisions, the particle $c$ in the $\gamma_{112}$ correlator is taken from

In this paper we calculate the angular diameter of the shadow for a non-rotating black hole that is surrounded by a non-magnetized pressure-less plasma. Although we are mainly interested in the Schwarzschild case, in large parts of the paper we work in an unspecified spherically symmetric and static spacetime, so the results can be applied, e.g., also to charged black holes or to wormholes.

In our work the plasma manifests itself as a refractive and dispersive medium, which leads to a change of the light rays in comparison with vacuum. As a result, the geometrical size of the shadow is changed. We do not take into account the processes of absorption and scattering of the photons by plasma electrons. Also, we neglect the gravitational field of the plasma particles.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section \[sec:eom\] we work out the equation of motion for light rays in a plasma on a spherically symmetric and static spacetime. In Section \[sec:circular\] we determine the circular light orbits which are of crucial relevance for the formation of the shadow. In Section \[sec:shadow\] we calculate the angular diameter of the shadow. We specify the results in Section \[sec:thin\] to the case of a low-density plasma and in Section \[sec:accretion\] to the case that the plasma has the particular density profile that corresponds to spherically symmetric accretion of a dust onto a Schwarzschild black hole. In the same section we also discuss the perspectives of actually observing the influence of a plasma on the shadow of a supermassive black hole.

We use units such that $G=c=1$, so the Schwarzschild radius is $R_S=2M$. Our choice of signature is $\{-,+,+,+\}$. We use Einstein’s summation convention for latin indices which take the values $i,k,$ $\dots$ $= t, r, \vartheta, \varphi$.

Equations of motion for light rays in a non-magnetized plasma {#sec:eom}
=============================================================

We consider a spherically symmetric and static metric $$\label{eq:g}
g_{ik}dx^{i} dx^{k} 
= - A(r) dt^2 + B(r) dr^2 +
D(r) \big( d \vartheta ^2 + \mathrm{sin} ^2 \vartheta \,

Here we have used the same notation for the fractional Mellin amplitudes $M_{\kappa (i_4\dots i_1)}$ as in [@mack2009] and assumed that they are to be known from OPE, generalising them to the free parameter $\kappa$. These amplitudes are functionals of the functions $F$ and the kinematic relations on $\omega_i$. Determination of the fractional Mellin amplitudes is no trivial matter as it also is not in using the ordinary Mellin transform. At this stage one may return to the procedures of using the kinematic relations between the different exponents $\xi_{ij}^0$ and the identification of the Mellin amplitudes from field theory, methods that have meanwhile been described in extension in the literature. The calculation parallels that [cf., e.g., @fitz2012] for the ordinary Mellin analogue. It is clear that in taking the limit $\kappa\to\infty$ after having performed all calculations reproduces the result that would be obtained applying the ordinary Mellin transform.

The possible advantage of the approach given in this brief note is that in the last expression the complex integration variables appear merely as variables in the denominator of the inverse fractional Mellin transform $\mathcal{M_\kappa}^{-1}$. In addition to the freedom gained which is buried in the arbitrary, possibly even complex parameter $\kappa$, they have got rid of their property of being complex powers, a property that should substantially simplify the application to CFT and the CFT/AdS duality. The second form of the Mellin transform lacks this obvious advantage.

To derive the closed equations for $n^{(s)}_{q\omega}$, first integrate Eq.  with respect to $p$: $$\begin{aligned}

Further notations will be simplified by introducing the dimensionless variables as $\tilde{\alpha} = \dfrac{2}{\pi}\dfrac{\alpha n_0}{e a_B}$, $\mathcal{U}_q = \dfrac{U_q}{\pi \hbar v_F}$, $\mathcal{E} = \dfrac{E}{e n_0^2}$, $\mathcal{E}_q = \dfrac{E_q}{e n_0}$, $\mathcal{F}_{q\omega} = \dfrac{F_{q\omega}}{e n_0}$, and $v_q = \dfrac{\omega}{v_F q}$, with $v_F = \dfrac{\hbar k_F}{m}$ and $a_B$ being the Bohr radius in the material.

**Update**: We use the Adam algorithm [@kingma2014adam] with the step size of $0.01$ to update the learning parameters. The Adam algorithm requires $\frac{\partial \mathcal{D}}{\partial \bm{A}}$ obtained in the backward step and it performs $\mathcal{O}(NK)$ arithmetic operations to update the parameters, where $NK$ is the number of learning parameters.

**Computational Complexity of TTW –** Calculating Equation (12) is the most computationally expensive step in the TTW algorithm. Time and space complexities needed to calculate this step is $\mathcal{O}(KNT)$. We run this step in a loop for $I$ iterations ($I=100$ in our experiments); therefore, time and space complexities of TTW are $\mathcal{O}(IKNT)$ and $\mathcal{O}(KNT)$ respectively. According to our experiments, a good choice for $K$ is a number between $8$ and $16$ for the datasets of the UCR archive.

Experiments
===========

\[sec:experiments\]

We use the UCR (University of California, Riverside) time-series classification archive to conduct experiments of this paper [@UCRArchive]. This archive contains $85$ datasets from a wide variety of applications (e.g., medical imaging, geology and astronomy). Each dataset is split into train and test sets and both sets contain class labels up to 60 classes. All time-series in a dataset of UCR have the same length; for different datasets this length varies from 24 to 2,709 samples.

**Baseline System**: We implement the GTW algorithm, proposed by Zhou et al. [@zhou2012generalized], as the baseline method for comparison. The basis functions and other parameters of the implemented GTW are consistent with Section 5.4 of their paper [@zhou2012generalized].

This result is a rewriting of $$\begin{gathered}
\mathbb E\!\left[ \delta\!\left(\frac{C(t_{\ell_J})}{G(t_{\ell_I})} - y\right) \ \Big \vert \ \frac{C(t_{\ell_I})}{G(t_{\ell_I})} = x \right] =

\int \mathrm d z \ \mathbb E\!\left[ \delta\!\left(\frac{C(t_{\ell_{I+1}})}{G(t_{\ell_I})} - z\right) \ \Big\vert \ \frac{C(t_{\ell_I})}{G(t_{\ell_I})} = x \right]

Supposing for simplicity that $\ell_0=0$ and $\ell_N=n$, the distribution of the portfolio at final maturity $t_n$ can then be obtained as $$\mathbb E\Big[ \delta\big(C(t_n)- y\big) \ \big\vert \ C(t_0) = x \Big]
  =
  \frac{1}{G(t_0)} \Psi_{t_0,t_n}\!\left( \frac{x}{G(t_0)} ,  \frac{y}{G(t_0)}  \right)$$

The main difference with the homogeneous payoff is the following: whereas the dynamics of $C(t_{\ell_I})/G(t_{\ell_I})$ taken at lock-in dates is Markovian, it is not true for the dynamics of $C(t_{\ell_I})$ itself.

The numerical implementation is similar to the other cases. Equation  is not a product of operators. As a consequence, it is also numerically more

Let $\mathcal L$ be a big line sheaf and let $D$ be a nonzero effective Cartier divisor on a projective variety $X$. We define $$\gamma_{\mathcal L,D } :=\limsup_{N\to\infty}\frac{N\cdot h^0(V,\mathcal L^N)}{\sum_{m=1}^{\infty} h^0 (V ,  \mathcal L^N(-m D)  ) }.$$

Let $D_1,\hdots,D_q$ be effective Cartier divisors on a variety $X$ of dimension $n$.

Since the discovery of the existence of a metal-insulator transition by Anderson [@and] originating by a significant presence of disorder in a sample of material, a large part of activity in condensed matter physics pertained the deep understanding of this effect originating from the localization of the conduction electrons [@mck].

Several breakthroughs as the scaling theory [@lic] appeared that improved the understanding of the metal-insulator transition. Besides, weak localization theory made clear the effect of higher order corrections to the scaling theory itself [@alt]. More recently, the interplay between disorder and electron-electron interaction has been clarified [@fin].

As in all phase transitions, also this case depends critically on the dimensionality of the system. Indeed, it is well-known that for $d\le 2$ the system always localizes and so it is always in an insulating phase. This result has been challenged by recent experimental findings [@kra1; @kra2] showing a 2D metal-insulator transition. This effect cannot be explained by the localization theory of Anderson and the scaling theory. A satisfactory explanation has been recently found numerically [@bac] through the effect of electron-electron interaction becoming increasingly important as the density of the two-dimensional electron gas is lowered producing a rich phase diagram in this limit.

Notwithstanding the increasing relevance that electron-electron interaction has assumed in recent years, there are a lot of situations for disordered crystals where the Anderson model proves to be a satisfactory description of the physics while leaving opened several problems. Current studies point toward a proper understanding of the scaling of the localization length with some specific parameters of the crystal as could be the energy. This scaling is characterized by a critical exponent $\nu$ that has been obtained both by experiments [@ex1; @ex2;

Adding the ${\operatorname{fix}}$ event is particularly beneficial for benchmarks with many disequalities, particularly `queens-400` which only uses disequalities.

Adding the ${\operatorname{bc}}$ event has significant benefit (up to 5%) when there are linear equalities as in `alpha` or [$\operatorname{bounds}({{\mathbb Z}})$]{} consistent as in `photo`. But for other examples, where one would expect some reduction in runtime, the overhead (to be discussed in more detail below) for maintaining a richer event set exceeds the gains from reducing the number of propagation steps. This is true for examples such as `minsort-200` (minimum propagators), `partition-32` (multiplication), and `golomb-10-b` and `square-7-b` (linear equations and [$\operatorname{bounds}({{\mathbb Z}})$]{} consistent ).

Splitting the ${\operatorname{bc}}$ event into ${\operatorname{lbc}}$ and ${\operatorname{ubc}}$ events exposes the overhead once more. There is almost never an improvement in number of propagations, since only inequalities can actually benefit, and there is substantial overhead.

p-evt-stat.tex

#### Influence of propagation order {#influence-of-propagation-order-1 .unnumbered}

Similar to using fixpoint reasoning, the use of events also changes the order in which propagators are executed. Table \[table:static-event-prio\] reconsiders all examples that could possibly benefit from ${\operatorname{bc}}$ or ${\operatorname{lbc}},{\operatorname{ubc}}$ events and all examples that show a remarkable increase in number of propagation steps in Table \[table:static-event\].

The numbers confirm that with priorities no considerable increase in runtime can be observed for all but `crowded-chess-7`, where the increase in runtime here is due to a change in propagation order to the introduction of event sets that does not depend on the relative priorities of the propagators used.

Once priorities are used, ${\operatorname{lbc}}$ and ${\operatorname{ubc}}$ are basically never beneficial.

#### Memory requirements {#memory-requirements .unnumbered}

Table \[table:event-mem\] shows the total memory allocated for different event sets relative to a propagation engine not using events (the engine uses dynamic fixpoint reasoning and priorities). It is important to

Our main result is the demonstration of the existence of the BG phase at arbitrarily weak disorder. We provide the proof of this fact in a ’direct’ and in an ’enhanced’ forms. By ’direct’ form we mean tracing the renormalization picture (in the superfluid phase, where the RG equations are asymptotically exact) with the observation that the commensurate scenario, taking place at smaller scales of distance, is destroyed at larger distances by sufficiently strong disorder, in favor of the universal disordered scenario. \[Incidentally, this accounts for the effect of disorder-stimulated superfluidity.\] So that commensurability turns out to be irrelevant to any second-order-type transition arising with decreasing of the strength of disorder. The ’enhanced’ proof does not rely on any assumption concerning the type of the transition leading to the destruction of superfluidity. We simply take the phase boundary for superfluid - insulator transition following from the ’direct’ treatment as a lower boundary for the strength of disorder sufficient to support superfluidity, without specifying the phase adjacent to SF. Then we compare the result with that for the MI phase boundary, following from the exact relation between the minimal amount of disorder destroying MI and the insulating gap of the pure system [@FM]. The comparison shows that, in relative units, the separation between the boundaries is ever increasing with vanishing disorder, thus revealing the presence of BG between MI and SF.

The RG descriptions of the superfluid-to-insulator transitions in 1D were initially constructed in terms of the effective action for the long-wave density deviations [@GS; @FWGF], employing Haldane’s representation of 1D bosons [@Hald]. For our purposes, however, it is more convenient to use a dual treatment in terms of the effective action for the phase field [@KPPS]. This language directly takes into account effects of the collective backscattering off either commensurate or disordered potential, the corresponding instantons being just vortices in the phase field in (1+1) dimensions. As a result, the descriptions for the commensurate and disordered cases turn out to be very close to each other. The only difference is that in the disordered case one deals with ’vertical’ vortex-antivortex pairs (the spatial coordinates of vortex, $x_1$, and antivortex, $x_2$, coincide up to some microscopic length), because contributions of non-vertical pairs are averaged out due to the random phase associated with the pair: $$\gamma (x_1,x_2)

This paper is organized as follows. The problem formulation is presented in Section \[sec:problem\]. Background results and concepts from algebraic topology are reviewed in Section \[sec:topology\]. The proposed approach is presented in Section \[sec:approach1\] for numerical data along with some simulation results. Extension of the method described in Section \[sec:approach1\] to mixed categorical and numerical data is discussed in Section \[sec:approach2\].

Problem formulation {#sec:problem}
===================

Let us consider a database table $T(A_1,A_2,\dots,A_m)$ consisting of $N$ rows, where each $A_i \in \D$ are various attributes that in general can take the form of *numeric* and/or *categorical* values, i.e., the domain $\D$ can either be a set of discrete or continuous values. Without loss of generality, we can identify with $Q_T = \{A_1,A_2,\dots,A_d\}$ a set of $d$ attributes that we define as *quasi-identifiers*, namely attributes that can be joined with external information/databases so that private information can be obtained. Typical examples of private data that could be obtained are names of individuals, salaries, etc.

Another database table $\bar{T}(\bar{A}_1, \bar{A}_2, \dots, \bar{A}_m)$ consisting of $N$ rows is said to be a *generalization* $\bar{T} = G(T)$ of the table $T$ if, for every row $T_j$ of $T$, $$Q_{T_j} \subset Q_{\bar{T}_j}\,.$$ In this paper, as said previously, we will be focusing on the concept of -anonymity for privacy, that is formally defined as follows.

Consider a generalized database $\bar{T}$ and a quasi-identifier set $Q_{\bar{T}}$. The set $Q_{\bar{T}}$ is said to have the -anonymity property if and only if each unique tuple in the projection of $\bar{T}$ on $Q_{\bar{T}}$ occurs at least $k$ times in $\bar{T}$.

Given a database $T$, the problem of -anonymity is thus

-   We have split the documents to get coherent chunks of text for retrieval. We have obtained 171 fragments that constitute our text collection, with an average length of 1331 words per fragment.

-   We have extended the original [*TOPIC*]{} tags of the Brown Corpus with a hierarchy of subtags, assigning a set of tags to each text in our collection. This is not used in the experiments reported here.

-   We have written a summary for each of the fragments, with lengths varying between 4 and 50 words and an average of 22 words per summary. Each summary is a human explanation of the text contents, not a mere bag of related keywords. These summaries serve as queries on the text collection, and then there is exactly one relevant document per query.

-   Finally, we have hand-tagged each of the summaries with WordNet 1.5 senses. When a word or term was not present in the database, it was left unchanged. In general, such terms correspond to groups (vg. [ *Fulton\_County\_Grand\_Jury*]{}), persons ([*Cervantes*]{}) or locations ([*Fulton*]{}).

We also generated a list of “stop-senses” and a list of “stop-synsets”, automatically translating a standard list of stop words for English.

The lignocellulosic biorefinery is based on a biochemical conversion platform where the polysaccharides in lignocellulosic material are converted to fuel by using enzymes [@huber]. One of the principal difficulty in the lignocellulosic biorefinery is the energy needs required by the process of fuel production [@ragauskas; @cardona; @piccolo]. Current integrated biorefinery involves the lignin-enriched residue as fuel for the energy needs, with the consequence of reducing the possibility of higher-value uses of lignin. The use of external sources of low-enthalpy heat can represent a way to overcome this unwanted consequence: waste heat from fermentation due to the presence of metabolism could be one of these sources.

Thermodynamic and thermoeconomic analysis, in particular the second law analysis, represents a powerful approach to evaluate the technological option for technology selection in order to design the more efficient biofuel production systems. In particular, our results can be summarized as follows:

-   for the *Spirulina platensis*: $7.79$ J kg$^{-1}_{b}$

-   for the *Chlorella vulgaris*: $85.20$ J kg$^{-1}_{b}$

where the indicator $EI_\lambda$ is expressed in kWh in order to assign an economic value comparable with other energy resources. The result is expressed in energy consumed per unit mass of biomass produced. In particular, considering the mean value of the kWh cost in Italy as 0.06797 EUR kWh$^{-1}$, obtaining the following cost of production:

-   for the *Spirulina platensis*: 0.53 EUR kg$^{-1}_{b}$;

-   for the *Chlorella vulgaris*: 5.79 EUR kg$^{-1}_{b}$.

This result highlight that biofuel becomes interesting from an economic point of view if obtained from cyanobacteria.

In the following sections we will heavily rely upon the mathematical notions of [*operations*]{} and [*instruments*]{}. Although these notions are well-known it will be in order to recall the pertinent definitions adapted to the present purposes and their interpretations in the context of measurement theory. In order to keep the presentation as simple as possible we restrict ourselves to the case of finite dimensional Hilbert spaces ${\mathcal H}$ and refer the reader to the literature on the general case of separable Hilbert spaces.

Let $B({\mathcal H})$ denote the space of Hermitean operators $A:{\mathcal H}\longrightarrow {\mathcal H}$ and $B_+({\mathcal H})$ the cone of positively semi-definite operators, i. e., having only non-negatives eigenvalues. Moreover, let $T:B({\mathcal H})\longrightarrow B({\mathcal H})$ be a linear map satisfying

-   $T$ is [*positive*]{}, i. e., maps $B_+({\mathcal H})$ into itself,

-   $T$ is [*completely positive*]{}. This means that $T\otimes {\mathbbm 1}:B({\mathcal H}\otimes {\mathbbm C}^N)\longrightarrow B({\mathcal H}\otimes {\mathbbm C}^N)$ will be positive for all integers $N$.

Then $T$ will be called an [*operation*]{}. It may be trace-preserving or not.

Operations are intended to describe state changes due to measurements. By definition, a [*Lüders measurement*]{} (without selection according to the outcomes) induces the state change $$\label{OI1}
  \rho \mapsto L(\rho)=\sum_{n\in{\mathcal N}} P_n\,\rho\,P_n
  \;,$$ where $\left(P_n\right)_{n\in{\mathcal N}}$ denotes a complete family of mutually orthogonal projections $P_n\in B_+({\mathcal H})$. Then $L$ is an example of a trace-preserving operation. Note that the map (\[OI1\]) is defined for all $\rho\in B({\mathcal H})$ whereas the physical interpretation holds only for [*statistical operators*]{} $\rho$, i. e., for positively semi-definite operators with $\mbox{Tr}(\rho)=1$.

We mention the following representation theorem for operations, see, e. g., [@BLPY16], prop.7.7, or [@NC00], chapter 8.2.3. $A$

[Figure \[fig:AofD\]]{} shows the estimated cross sections for an SIS clump embedded in the lens galaxy, as a function of ${\delta}$, for each image in the two systems. In B1422+231 there is a substantial cross section for the positive-parity images A and C to be made [*brighter*]{} by substructure (${\delta}>0$). There is a smaller cross section for negative-parity image B to be likewise enhanced, but a much more significant cross section for it to be made [*dimmer*]{} (${\delta}<0$). The faint negative-parity image D is much less likely to be affected, and due to its faintness it is more likely to be brightened than dimmed. The results for PG 1115+080 are similar: positive-parity images (A$_1$ and C) are always brightened by an SIS clump, while negative-parity images (A$_2$ and B) can be brightened but are much more likely to be suppressed. The differences between positive-parity images and negative-parity images are similar to those discussed by Schechter & Wambsganss (2002). Although those authors were studying microlensing (perturbations by point-mass stars), the qualitative features are similar because the conceptual differences between SIS and point-mass clumps are small.

=8.0cm =8.0cm

[Figure \[fig:AofZ\]]{} shows how the cross sections change if the clump is taken out of the lens galaxy and placed elsewhere along the line of sight. In general the cross sections peak at the redshift of the lens galaxy, but the curves are relatively broad with a FWHM of $\Delta z \sim 0.11$–$0.34$. In other words, clumps could differ in redshift from the lens galaxy by up to several tenths and still have a significant effect on the images. For positive-parity images, the cross section for brightening (${\delta}>0$) even has tails extending to $z=0$ and to the source redshift. For negative-parity images, the cross section for dimming (${\delta}<0$) is broad but falls to zero at the redshifts where ${\beta}> ({\kappa}+{\gamma})^{-1}$ (see eq. \[eq:effparity\]). The cross section for brightening (${\delta}>0$) of negative-parity images is actually a [*

First note that if $m=1$ then $(1)$ holds. For the case $2\leq m<n$, note that to obtain a $m$-dimensional subspace which contains the given vector $\xi$, it is sufficient to choose another $m-1$ vectors such that these $m-1$ vectors and the vector $\xi$ span a $m$-dimensional subspace. For the choice of the first vector, we have $p^{n}-p$ choices from ${\mathbb{F}_{p}^{n}}$ (except the vectors from the subspace of ${\mathbb{F}_{p}^{n}}$ which spanned by $\xi$). For the choice of the second vector, we have $p^{n}-p^{2}$ choices to make sure that the second vector, the first vector, and the vector $\xi$ span a $3$-dimensional subspace. We continue to do this until we choose $m-1$ vectors. In the end we have $(p^{n}-p)(p^{n}-p^{2})\cdots (p^{n}-p^{m-1})$ amount of choices. Note that for each $m$-dimensional subspace which contains vector $\xi$, there are amount of $(p^{m}-p)(p^{n}-p^{2})\cdots (p^{m}-p^{m-1})$ choices which generate (or span) the same subspace. It follows that (see for the definition of ${n \choose m}_{p}$) the amount of $m$-dimensional plane which contain $\xi$ is $$\frac{(p^{n}-p)(p^{n}-p^{2})\cdots (p^{

\[Question-Weak-version\] Does there exist a transcendental entire function $f$ such that $\mathcal{J}(f)$ is connected and $$\liminf_{r\rightarrow+\infty}\frac{\log M(2r, f^k)}
{\log M(r,f^k)}=d_k\in [1,2]$$ for each $k\in \mathbb{N}$?

Question \[Question-Strong-Version\] and Question \[Question-Weak-version\] are asked for the general transcendental entire function $f$. In fact, we could further restrict $f$ into some special class of functions to consider the questions above. One can still replace $\log M(r,f)$ by the Nevanlinna’s characteristic $T(r,f)$ or Ahlfors-Shimizu’s characteristic $T_{0}(r,f)$ to discuss the similar questions. For the definitions of these two characteristics, we refer to Section \[Preliminaries\].

Up to now, we investigate the case that $f$ has only simply connected Fatou components. A nature question is whether we can get the similar results when $f$ has some multiply connected Fatou component $U$? We will give a partial answer under the condition $e(U)=2$, where $e(U)$ denotes the eventual connectivity of $U$. Kisaka and Shishikura [@Kisaka-Shishikura] proved that $e(U)$ can only be $2$ or $\infty$ for any multiply connected Fatou component of a transcendental entire function. In the sequence, we will consider the case that $f$ has a multiply connected Fatou component. We confine the case that the eventual connectivity is $2$ and get the following.

\[Multiply\] Let $f$ be a transcendental entire function. Assume that $\mathcal{F}(f)$ has a multiply Fatou component with eventual connectivity $2$. Then $z\in \mathcal{J}(f)$ if and only if $$\lim_{n\rightarrow+\infty}\frac{1}{n}\log S(f^n, D(z,r))=+\infty$$ for any $r>0.$

We believe that the growth condition can be completely removed. Here, we prove a theorem without any growth condition, while we need to restrict ourselves in hyperbolic transcendental entire functions in class $$\mathcal{B}=\{

We have also tested this idea with a simulation of the stellar orbits diffusion. We have inserted tracer stars in an exponential disk under the 3D model for the Galaxy, as described in Flynn et al. ([@flynn]). New stars are born each time step, simulating a constant SFR. The stars are given small random kicks in their velocities at each time step. Stars near the solar circle get sufficient kicks for being heated up to have values of the velocity dispersion ellipsoid similiar to the observed one. Closer to the galactic center, the heating is greater, increasing exponentially inward with the same scale length as the disk light distribution (circa 4 kpc), with less heating in the outer disk. Inside 2 kpc, the heating is cut off, to simulate less molecular clouds there and to simplify the computation. Indeed, such stars are not expected to be deflected onto orbits which eventually take them out to the solar circle over the disk lifetime.

At the end of the simulation, we find all stars which are on or near to the solar circle. We have computed the mean guiding radius of their present orbit, $R_m$ and compared it with the a priori known birth radius $R_i$. The relationship found between them is $\langle (R_i-R_\odot)\rangle 
\approx 2 \langle (R_m-R_\odot) \rangle$ as expected by the theoretical considerations performed by Wielen et al. ([@WFD]).

The problem does indeed come when one tries to recover the relationship from the data. The only way we have of recovering $R_i$ from the data is to use \[Fe/H\]. The disk gradient is only about 0.1 dex/kpc, and the scatter in the local metallicities is (intrinsically) of the same order or larger (e.g., Edv93; Paper I). Here, by scatter, we mean the width of the \[Fe/H\] distribution. In our sample, $R_m$ lies in the range 6 to 10 kpc, so that the birth radii of the stars lie in the range 7 to 9 kpc. Over such a short range in the disk, the mean metallicity of the stars changes by only 0.1 dex in either direction, whereas the intrinsic dispersion (over all ages) is 0.12-0.3 dex.

Our results show that $R_m$ can surely give some information about the birthplace radii of the stars. But this

abstract: 'With improving methods and surveys, the young field of extrasolar planets has recently expanded into a qualitatively new domain - terrestrial (mostly rocky) planets. The first such planets were discovered during the past year, judging by their measured masses of less than 10 Earth-masses ($M_{\oplus}$) or Super-Earths. They are introducing a novel physical regime that has not been explored before as such planets do not exist in our Solar System. Their composition can be either completely terrestrial or harbour an extensive ocean (water and ices) above a rocky core. We model the structure and properties of the first Super-Earth (mass $\sim$ 7.5 $M_{\oplus}$) discovered in 2005, illustrating the possibilities in composition and providing radius evaluations in view of future detection of similar planets by transits. We find that a threshold in radius exists for which larger values indicate that a Super-Earth most certainly has an extensive water content. In the case of GJ876d this threshold is at about 12000 km. Our results show that unique characterization of the bulk composition of Super-Earths will be possible in future transit studies.'

Introduction
============

In the last 11 years more than 200 exoplanets have been discovered but only in the last year the minimum mass for detection has been pushed down to allow for terrestrial planets. The first extra-solar planet with a mass lower than 10 $M_{\oplus}$, i.e. a Super-Earth, was discovered last year by @Rivera_et_al:2005 orbiting an M4V star named GJ876. Its estimated mass is 7.5$\pm$0.7 $M_{\oplus}$ and it has an orbital period of 1.94 days. It is close to the host star and the surface temperature is calculated to range between 430 and 650 K [@Rivera_et_al:2005] . The star is known to have two gas giant planets GJ876b,c in 30 and 61 day orbits [@Marcy_et_al:1998; @Marcy_et_al:2001]. Hence, the planetary system of star G

Finally, figure \[fig-3\] shows the results in case $\chi=2.4$. As one can see, both $c_0$ and $c_1$ modes generate simultaneously in a wide range of the applied current. One should also note how mode $c_0$ power differs from the ideal case (dashed line). This is a result of energy conservation, i.e., system (\[init\]) can be treated as conservative, having one of integrals $Q=|c_0|^2+|c_1|^2$ which is the total mode power. Obviously, in the case when one has a two-mode generation regime, each mode power will be lower than in the case of one-mode regime.

It should be noted that figures \[fig-1\]–\[fig-3\] show stationary mode powers. Time evolution of a system is not considered, that is why the present approach is not suitable for analyzing the mode time evolution under the action of spin-polarized current.

Conclusions
===========

In conclusion, it was demonstrated that thermal noise acting on STNO under the action of spin-polarized current can lead to numerous fundamental effects. When the power of thermal noise is relatively small, one-mode generation regime in STNO is not affected though subcritical regime ($\Delta<1$) appears. This regime corresponds to the regenerative regime when STNO efficiently filters the lowest eigenmode of the STNO from the noise, providing a measurable output microwave signal before the actual threshold of excitation $I=I_\textrm{th}$ for this mode is reached. An increase of thermal noise power leads to the regime at which both modes of the system have nonzero powers at some region of the applied currents. This regime is similar to the one observed in the experiments of two-mode generation regime. The region of two-mode generation is edged by a simple one-mode generation regime where only the lowest frequency mode has nonzero power.

Here we explain how to install and use `qeirreps`. The flowchart of the calculations is shown in Fig. \[fig:flow\].

Compiling environment for `qeirreps`
------------------------------------

A Fortran 90 compiler, BLAS, and LAPACK libraries are required for the installation of `qeirreps`. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Quantum ESPRESSO</span> must also be installed in advance. The version of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Quantum ESPRESSO</span> must be qe-6.3 or before. [^1] To obtain old-formatted output files, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Quantum ESPRESSO</span> must be compiled with the following option: $$\texttt{\$ ./configure --enable-xml=no}\ .$$

In addition, the program `qe2respack` [@respack] [^2] is required, which can be downloaded or cloned from the branch of `respack` “maxime2" in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/mnmpdadish/respackDev/). The program `qe2respack` is in the directory `util/qe2respack`. For installation, the file `Makefile` must be edited to specify the compiler, libraries, and the location of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Quantum ESPRESSO</span> in your compiling environment. By typing `$ make` in the directory `util/qe2respack`, the executable binary `qe2respack` is compiled.

Installation of `qeirreps`
--------------------------

Our program `qeirreps` is released at GitHub (https://github.com/qeirreps/qeirreps). The program files which contain source files, documents, and examples can be cloned or downloaded from this repository. The file `qeirreps/src/Makefile` must be edited to specify the compiler and libraries in your compiling environment. By typing `$ make` in the source directory `qeirreps/src/`, the executable binary `qeirreps.x` is compiled.

In this article we obtain integrators that, at the same time, avoid the use of negative steps and do not require special assumptions on the operator, as well as they exploit the simplicity of the decomposition of the original problem. These methods can also be applied to problems with nonlocal nonlinearities as it is shown below. It is possible to build arbitrary high order integrators for which the number of basic steps is lower than previous symplectic methods. Moreover, these methods can naturally be parallelized. In this work, we present a rigorous proof of the convergence of the proposed methods, and we also test their performance in several examples of interest.

We study the initial value problem $$\begin{aligned}
\begin{cases}
\label{eq: ut=Au}
\partial_{t}u=A_{0}\,u+A_{1}(u),\\
u(0)=u_{0},
\end{cases}\end{aligned}$$ where $A_{0}$ is a linear closed operator densely defined in $D(A_{0})\subset\mathsf{H}$, $\mathsf{H}$ is a Hilbert space, which generates a quasicontraction semi-group of operators. We assume that the nonlinear term $A_{1}:\mathsf{H}\to\mathsf{H}$ is a smooth mapping with $A_{1}(0)=0$. In many problems of interest, the partial equations

\[eq: flujos parciales\] $$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq: ut=A0u}
\partial_{t}u=&\,A_{0}\,u,\\
\label{eq: ut=A1u}
\partial_{t}u=&\,A_{1}(u),\end{aligned}$$

can be easily solved either analytically or numerically, which enable to find approximated solutions of the problem applying in turn the flows $\phi_0$ and $\phi_1$ associated to each partial problem and respectively.

There exist many numerical integration methods for based on splitting methods, the most known are the Lie–Trotter and Strang methods defined by $$\begin{aligned}
\Phi_{\mathrm{Lie}}(h,u)=&\,\phi_{1}(h,\phi_{0}(h,u)), \\
\Phi_{\mathrm{Strang}}(h,u)=&\,\phi_{0}(h/2,\phi_{1}(h,\phi_{0}(h/2,u))),\

Methods
=======

In this Section we consider the problem of learning the unknown function $F$ from observations $(\y(t_0), \ldots, \y(t_M) ) \in \R^{N \times (M+1)}$ of the system’s state $\u(t) = (u(\x_1,t),\ldots,u(\x_N,t))^T$ at $N$ arbitrary spatial locations $(\x_1, \dots, \x_N)$ and at $M+1$ time points $(t_0, \dots, t_M)$. We introduce efficient graph convolution neural networks surrogates operating over continuous-time to learn PDEs from sparse data.

We apply the method of lines (MOL) to numerically solve Equation $\ref{eq:pde}$. [@schiesser2012numerical]. The MOL consists of selecting $N$ nodes in $\Omega$ and discretizing spatial derivatives in $F$ at these nodes. We place the nodes to the observation locations $(\x_1, \dots, \x_N)$. The discretization leads to $F$ being approximated by $\hat{F}$ and produces the following system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) whose solution asymptotically approximates the solution of Equation $$\begin{aligned}
 \label{eq:odes}
    \dot{\u}(t) = \begin{pmatrix} \du_1(t) \\  \vdots \\ \du_N(t) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{d u(\x_1, t)}{dt} \\  \vdots \\ \frac{d u(\x_N, t)}{dt} \end{pmatrix} &\approx \begin{pmatrix} \hat{F}(\x_1, \x_{\N(1)}, u_1, u_{\N(1)})  \\ \vdots \\ \hat{F}(\x_N, \x_{\N(N)}, u_N, u_{\N(N)}) \end{pmatrix} \in \R^N.\end{aligned}$$ As the discretized $\hat

2.  The angular correlation functions of EROs were measured with several colour and magnitude thresholds from the DXS/Subaru sample. All these correlation functions showed a clear break at $\sim 0.02^{\circ}$ which implies that the angular correlation function of EROs cannot be described by a single power-law. Furthermore, redder or brighter EROs showed higher amplitudes than bluer or fainter ones. The correlation functions from the DXS/PS1 and the DXS/Subaru samples with the same criteria also showed good agreement. The correlation functions at different redshifts had similar amplitudes on large scales, indicating a higher bias at higher redshift.

3.  A standard halo model was fitted to the observed angular correlation of EROs and matches well. The biases for EROs range between 2.7 and 3.5, and the average dark matter halo mass hosting EROs is over $10^{13} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$. EROs at higher redshifts are more biased and located in slightly less massive dark matter haloes than at lower redshift. Also the ERO satellite fraction decreases with increasing redshift. The different fraction of old, passive EROs at different redshifts may affect the properties. In addition, the overall halo properties for EROs are consistent with $10^{11.0} M_{\odot}<M_{*}<10^{11.5} M_{\odot}$ galaxies.

4.  The predicted angular correlation function of EROs from the [GALFORM]{} semi-analytic model showed good agreement with the observed correlation function. Comparing the halo model for observed EROs to the [GALFORM]{} predictions, we found that the EROs predicted by [GALFORM]{} present too high a fraction of satellite galaxies or too many galaxies in less massive haloes. Finally, we stress that the results from the HOD frame work must be interpreted with care due to the effect of AGN feedback and that additional refinements are necessary in future semi-analytical models to improve the modelling of the physics of galaxy formation.

Our clustering results are derived from the large solid angle survey currently available. Nevertheless, the effects of cosmic variance dominate at large scales, so substantial improvements could be obtained in the measurements from even larger surveys. In the near future, the completed UKIDSS and VISTA surveys will be important for making further progress on studying galaxy evolution at $z>1$. Moreover the combination of near-IR surveys and improved optical surveys such as Pan-STARRS, Hyper Suprime Camera on Sub

Samples (100000) were originally at high temperature but they had a small magnetisation per site $m_{0}=0.$ $0278.$ The size of the lattice in this case is L = 72 and the updating was done with heat-bath dynamics. Figure 1.a shows results for the case $(J^{\prime }/J)$ $=2$ whereas figure 1.b presents results for $(J^{\prime }/J)=0.5$.

The slope of those curves depends on the ratio ($J^{\prime }/J$) and give estimates for $\eta ^{*}$.(Eq.

Dynamical low-rank approximation methods have been considered in [[@Cheng2013-1; @Cheng2013-2; @Koch2007; @Musharbash2014; @Sapsis2009]]{}, with different types of constructions but an approximation of the same form $$\begin{aligned}
{\boldsymbol{u}}(t,{\boldsymbol{\xi}}) \approx \sum_{i=1}^r {\boldsymbol{v}}_i(t) \alpha_i(t,{\boldsymbol{\xi}}), \label{approxformdynamical}\end{aligned}$$ which at each instant $t$ can be interpreted as a rank-$r$ approximation in the tensor space $X \otimes \mathbb{R}^{{\boldsymbol{\Xi}}}$. Again, the approximation can be seen as a projection onto a time-dependent reduced space $X_r(t)$ but here, the projection is obtained through principles which are local in time (e.g., Dirac-Frenkel principle). This results in a reduced order model which takes the form of a dynamical system.\
In this paper, we propose a new model order reduction method for solving general parameter-dependent dynamical systems of the form . This method provides an approximation of the form , so that it can be interpreted as a dynamical low-rank approximation method. However, the proposed method differs from existing dynamical low-rank approximation methods in that it adopts a subspace point of view and provides a uniform control of the error over the parameter set. The reduced space $X_r(t) \subset X$ is here obtained as the span of some selected trajectories $\{{\boldsymbol{u}}(\cdot,{\boldsymbol{\xi}}^i)\}_{i=1}^r$ of the full-order model . The approximation is obtained by solving a reduced dynamical system of size $r$ obtained by Galerkin projection (see, e.g., [@Benner2013]), which has the form of the initial dynamical system with a modified flux which takes into account the time dependency of the subspace. The resulting approximation (when discarding some necessary numerical approximations) interpolates the solution map ${\boldsymbol{\xi}}\mapsto {\boldsymbol{u}}(\cdot,{\boldsymbol{\xi}})$ at points $\{{\boldsymbol{\xi}}^1,\hdots,{\boldsymbol{\xi}}^r\}$. An a posteriori error estimate $\Delta_r(t,{\boldsymbol{\xi}})$ (local in time) is derived in the lines of [@Wirtz2014] using the logarithmic Lipschitz constant associated to the flux. This error

The Basis of Mallavibarrena and Sols {#sec:msbasis}
====================================

The purpose of this section is to define the basis of Mallavibarrena and Sols [@MS].

Fix a triple of partitions $\alpha = (\mb{a},\mb{b},\mb{c})$ of nonnegative integers $A,B,C$ such that $A + B + C = N$, respectively. Let $r,s,t$ be the lengths of $\mb{a},\mb{b},\mb{c}$ and let $e,f,g$ be indices for $\mb{a},\mb{b},\mb{c}$, respectively. We will associate to this data a locally closed subset $U_{\alpha}$ of the open set in $\mathbb{P}^{2[N]}$ of reduced subschemes. The class $\sigma_{\alpha} = \left[\overline{U_{\alpha}}\right]$ of its closure in $\mathbb{P}^{2[N]}$ will be an element of the MS basis.

Fix $r$ general lines $L_e$ with $r$ general points $P_e \in L_e$, $s$ general lines $M_f$, and a general point $Q$. The locus $U_{\alpha}$ is the locus of reduced schemes $Z$ in $\mathbb{P}^{2[N]}$ which can be written as the disjoint union of three subschemes $Z = Z_1 \cup Z_2 \cup Z_3$ such that:

1.  $Z$ does not contain $Q$ or any point of intersection of any pair of fixed lines.

2.  $Z_1$ contains each point $P_e$, and meets each line $L_e$ in $\mb{a}_e$ points.

3.  $Z_2$ meets each line $M_f$ in $\mb{b}_f$ points.

4.  $Z_3$ contains $t$ disjoint subschemes $Z_{3,g}$ consisting of $\mb{c}_g$ points collinear with $Q$.

The codimension of $U

Here $\alpha_d$ is a constant depending on the dimensionality $%
d=3,2$ or $1$ of the emitter (the well has dimension $d-1$). The values are, $\alpha_1=2, \alpha_2=2L\sqrt{2m^*}/\Pi\hbar, \alpha_3=m^*L^2/\pi\hbar^2$, where $L$ is the width of the emitter and $m^*$ the effective mass of the carriers.

The capacitance C represents the Coulomb barrier. As charge flows through the nonlinear element, entering the well, the voltage drop $V=U_0-U$ is reduced. At the same time charge is allowed to leave the well through the collector represented by the load resistor R. These elements define a time constant $\tau_0=RC$ characterizing the rate at which the well may be emptied. With these definitions the conservation of charge provides an equation of motion for the voltage $U(t)$ on the output side of the device,

$$C\left(U(t+\tau)-U(t)\right)=\Delta Q - \tau \frac{U(t)}{R}.$$

Defining $V_n=V(t+n\tau)$ one obtains from Eqs. (1) and (4) the following iterated map,

$$V_{n+1}=(1- \gamma) V_n - \gamma R I_{max}f(V_n) + \gamma U_0,$$

where $\gamma=\tau/\tau_0$ and we assume that $\tau_0>\tau$ holds. The map has fixed points given by

$$V^*=U_0-RI_{max}f(V^*).$$

A simple linear analysis in the neighborhood of one of these fixed points shows that for it to be stable the condition

$$-1< R I_{max} \frac{df}{dV}|_{V^*}<2/\gamma - 1$$

must be satisfied. It follows that for either an increasing or decreasing function $f(V)$ at the fixed point, an instability occurs provided the local derivative is sufficiently large in absolute value for the above condition to be violated. For a sharp resonance the function $f(V)$ will essentially follow the profile given by Eq.(3) within the window $E_r -
E_F\le V \

There, we observe that the total flux is symmetric as a function of the parameter $\alpha$, about its value $1/2$. This is due to a duality linking the HPC models with specific volumes $\alpha$ and $\hat{\alpha}$, when $\hat{\alpha} = 1-\alpha$. In fact, given the configuration I$=\{q_1, q_2, q_3,  \ldots, q_L\}$ with $q_0=0$ and $q_L=\alpha_L$, let us build the sister configuration II$=\{r_0,r_1, r_2,\ldots ,r_L\}$, starting from $r_0 = (1-\alpha)L$, and recursively defining $r_{m+1} =  r_m - 1  + (q_{L-m+1}-q_{L-m})$. Since the original length is $\alpha L$, the length of the new configuration is equal to $(1-\alpha)L$. Let us finally assume that the velocities of the configuration II are left unchanged: $\dot r_{m} = \dot q_{L-m}$.

Consider now two consecutive particles with positions $q_n$ and $q_{n+1}$ in the configuration I and assume that they are moving against one another. They will undergo a type-A collision after a time $\tau  = d/(\dot q_{n+1}-\dot  q_n)$, where $d =  q_{n+1}-q_n$ is the initial mutual distance. Within the sister configuration II, the corresponding particles of coordinate $r_m

Open cluster monitoring provides the following advantages and incentives:

-   In general, metallicity, age, distance, and foreground reddening are either known or may be determined for cluster members (more easily than for random field stars). Thus, planets detected around cluster stars will readily represent data points for any statistic correlating planet frequency with age or metallicity of the parent star.

-   The planet-formation processes, and hence planet frequencies, may differ between the open cluster and Galactic field populations. This study allows the EXPLORE Project to compare these two different environments.

-   Specific masses and radii for cluster stars may be targeted in the search by the choice of cluster and by adjusting exposure times for the target. In general, smaller stars offer better chances to detect the low-amplitude transit signal.

The difficulties and challenges involving open cluster surveys are:

-   The number of monitored stars is typically lower than in rich Galactic fields, reducing the statistical chance of detecting planets.

-   Determining cluster membership of stars in the open cluster fields without spectroscopic data is difficult due to the contamination by Galactic field stars. Since the clusters are typically concentrated toward the Galactic disk, this contamination may be significant.

-   Significant differential reddening across the cluster field and along the line of sight can make isochrone fitting (and subsequent determination of physical parameters such as age, distance, and metallicity) difficult.

Note that both of the latter two difficulties may at least in part be circumvented by obtaining spectra. In this work, we illustrate some of the points mentioned above, describe our observing and data-reduction strategies, and show some of our preliminary results of the southern open cluster NGC 2660. Preliminary results of the study of our second target, NGC 6208, are presented in a companion paper [@lbm04] in this volume.

    Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) generate valuable knowledge about network security, but an abundance of false alarms and a lack of methods to capture the interdependence among alerts hampers their utility for network defense. Here, we explore a graph-based approach for fusing alerts generated by multiple IDSs (e.g., Snort, OSSEC, and Bro). Our approach generates a weighted graph of alert fields (not network topology) that makes explicit the connections between multiple alerts, IDS systems, and other cyber artifacts. We use this multi-modal graph to identify anomalous changes in the alert patterns of a network. To detect the anomalies, we apply the role-dynamics approach, which has successfully identified anomalies in social media, email, and IP communication graphs. In the cyber domain, each node (alert field) in the fused IDS alert graph is assigned a probability distribution across a small set of roles based on that node’s features. A cyber attack should trigger IDS alerts and cause changes in the node features, but rather than track every feature for every alert-field node individually, roles provide a succinct, integrated summary of those feature changes. We measure changes in each node’s probabilistic role assignment over time, and identify anomalies as deviations from expected roles.

    We test our approach using IDS alerts generated from a network of 24 virtual machines (workstations, data and print servers, DHCP and DNS servers), virtual switches, and a virtual server that approximates connections to the internet. The simulation includes three weeks of normal background traffic, as well as cyber attacks that occur near the end of the simulations. The network includes installations of Snort and OSSEC, which generated alerts throughout the experiment. A NetFlow sensor also captured the network traffic during the simulation. This paper presents a novel approach to multi-modal data fusion and a novel application of role dynamics within the cyber-security domain. Our results show a drastic decrease in the false-positive rate when considering our anomaly indicator instead of the IDS alerts themselves, thereby reducing alarm fatigue and providing a promising avenue for threat intelligence in network defense.

If $i'=i$ and $j'=j$ then $V(G_i)\cap V(G_j)$ contains $v_1$ and $v_2$, a contradiction.

If $i'=i$ and $j'\neq j$ then $$v_1,G_i,v_2,G_{j'},u_2,G_j,v_1$$ is a cluster-cycle of length $3$. It follows that we can assume $i\neq i'$ and, by symmetry, $j\neq j'$. Now if $i'=j'$ then we have a cycle $$v_1,G_i,u_1,G_{i'},u_2,G_j,v_1$$ hence $i'\neq j'$. But then there is a cycle of clusters $$v_1,G_i,u_1,G_{i'},v_2,G_{j'},u_2,G_j,v_1$$ of length $4$. That gives a contradiction in the case $v_1,v_2\not\in\sigma$.

Now suppose $v_1\in\sigma$. Define $i$ by the condition $v_1v_2\in E(G_i)$. Let $u\in\sigma$ be any vertex such that $u\not\in V(G_i)$. Then $u\neq v_1,v_2$. Now $v_1,u,v_2$ is a triangle in $G$ whose one edge is in $E(G_i)$ and its opposite vertex is not in $V(G_i)$. That easily implies that the cluster-girth of $G$ is $3$, and the proof of (\*) is complete.

Suppose that $v\not\in V(G_i)$. Let $v_1\neq v_2$ be any two vertices of $\sigma$. We have $v\neq v_1$ and $v\neq v_2$ since $v_1,v_2\in V(G_i)$ and $v\not\in V(G_i)$. If $j,l$ are defined by $vv_1\in E(G_j)$ and $vv_2\in E(G_l)$ then $j\neq i$ and $

\[proposition-difference-galois-correspondence\] Let $\mathcal{K}$ be a difference field of characteristic $0$ with bijective endomorphisn and algebraically closed constant field $k$, and let $\mathcal{M}$ be an étale difference module over $\mathcal{K}$. Denote by $T(\mathcal{P})$ the total Picard-Vessiot ring of $\mathcal{M}$ over $\mathcal{K}$ and by $G$ the Galois group scheme. The maps $H \mapsto T(\mathcal{P})^H$ and $\mathcal{L} \mapsto \operatorname{Aut}(T(\mathcal{P}){\mid}\mathcal{L})$ define an order-reversing bijection between the set of closed subgroups of $G(k)$ and those intermediate difference rings of $\operatorname{Aut}(T(\mathcal{P}){\mid}\mathcal{K})$ where every non-zerodivisor is a unit.

Note that since $k$ is assumed to be algebraically closed of characteristic 0, one can work here with closed subgroups of $G(k)$ as in classical differential Galois theory. Having this correspondence at our disposal, the same argument that proved Theorem \[idobs\] also gives:

\[solution-rings-difference-case\] Let $\mathcal{L}$ be an intermediate difference ring of $T(\mathcal{P}){\mid}\mathcal{K}$ in which every non-zerodivisor is a unit.

The ring $\mathcal{L}$ is a total solution ring for $\langle \mathcal{M} \rangle_{\otimes}$ if and only if the corresponding subgroup $H$ is an observable subgroup of the Galois group $G(k)$.

Finally, we discuss an application to transcendence theory pointed out to us by Yves André. In ([@MR3215927], Corollary 1.7.1) he explains how his results on solution algebras for differential modules imply a theorem of Beukers [@beukers] concerning the specialization of algebraic relations between E-functions. The theory of solution algebras for difference equations sketched above implies the analogous results of Adamczewski–Faverjon [@adamczewski] and Philippon [@philippon] for Mahler functions.

In this section we prove some of the main results listed in the introduction. We start with Theorem \[xxthm0.2\].

If $Z(A)$ is not isomorphic to $\Bbbk[t]$, the assertion follows from Lemma \[xxlem3.7\](1). If $Z(A)$ is isomorphic to $\Bbbk[t]$, the assertion follows from Lemma \[xxlem3.7\](3).

Note that every AS-regular algebra has finite global dimension. If $A$ is not PI, then by Lemma \[xxlem2.7\], $$\operatorname{GKdim}Z \leq \operatorname{GKdim}A-2=3-2=1.$$ If $Z(A)$ is not isomorphic to $\Bbbk[t]$, the assertion follows from Lemma \[xxlem3.7\](1). If $Z(A)$ is isomorphic to $\Bbbk[t]$ and if $\operatorname{gldim}A/(t)=\infty$, the assertion follows from Lemma \[xxlem3.7\](3). For the rest of the proof we assume that $Z(A)=\Bbbk[t]$ and $A/(t)$ has finite global dimension.

By Rees lemma, $\operatorname{gldim}A/(t)\leq 2$. By the Hilbert series computation, we obtain that $\operatorname{GKdim}A/(t)=2$. This implies that $A/(t)$ is AS-regular of global dimension two. Since we assume that $\Bbbk$ is algebraically closed, $A/(t)$ is either $\Bbbk_q[x,y]$ or $\Bbbk_{J}[x,y]$. In particular, the Hilbert series of $A/(t)$ is $\frac{1}{(1-s)^2}$. Since $A$ is AS-regular of global dimension three, it is generated by either $3$ elements or $2$ elements. Next we consider these two cases.

Case 1: $A$ is generated by two elements. Then the Hilbert series of $A$ is $\frac{1}{(1-s)^2(1-s^2)}$. It forces that $\deg t=2$. If $A/(t)=
\Bbbk_q[x,y]$, then $t=xy-qyx$ and $A/(t-1)=\Bbbk\langle x,y \rangle/(xy-qyx-1)$. If $

### Tag-based Image Retrieval

We evaluate the effectiveness of tag relevance fusion in context of tag-based image retrieval. That is, for each of the 81 test tags, we sort images labeled with that tag in descending order by (fused) tag relevance scores.

*Baselines*. As our goal is to study whether tag relevance fusion helps, the single-feature neighbor voting [@tagrel-tmm09] is a natural baseline. For a more comprehensive comparison, we implement the following three present-day methods: tag position [@jasist11-sun], tag ranking [@tagranking-www09], and semantic field [@tmm12-zhu]. As tag ranking requires a specific visual feature for kernel density estimation in the feature space, we try tag ranking with each of the four features.

*Evaluation Criteria*. We use Average Precision (AP), which is in wide use for evaluating visual search engines. We also report Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), commonly used to assess the top few ranked results of web search engines [@ndcg]. We compute NDCG for the top 100 ranked results. For overall comparisons, we average AP and NDCG scores over concepts, reporting mAP and mNDCG.

*Test of statistical significance*. We conduct significance tests, with the null hypothesis that there is no difference in mAP (or mNDCG) of two image retrieval systems. In particular, we use the randomization test as recommended by Smucker [*et al.* ]{}[@cikm07-msmucker].

### Visual Concept Learning with Weak Labeling

In this experiment, we apply tag relevance fusion to select better training examples for visual concept learning. The resultant concept classifiers will enable us to search images that are totally unlabeled. Concretely, for each test tag, we select its positive training examples from the NUS-WIDE training set, by sorting images in descending order by Late-minmax-average, and preserve the top 100 ranked images. We consider SemanticField and TagRel$_{\text{COLOR}}$ as two baselines, applying them separately to acquire another two sets of 100 positive training examples. As the focus is to compare which positive set is better, the same negative training data shall be used. We take a random subset of 1,000 images from the NUS-WIDE training set as the common negative

1.  $\{x,y,\{z,u,v\}\}=\{\{x,y,z\},u,v\}-\{z,\{y,x,u\},v\}+\{z,u,\{x,y,v\}\}$;

2.  the mapping $z\rightarrow \{x,x,z\}$ is hermitian and has non-negative spectrum;

3.  $\|\{x,x,x\}\|=\|x\|^3$.

In [@Isidro03], J. M. Isidro shows that every Hilbert $C^*$-module is a ${\rm JB}^*$-triple with the Jordan triple product $$\{x,y,z\}=\displaystyle\frac{1}{2}(x\langle y,z\rangle+z\langle y,x\rangle).$$ A well-known theorem of Kaup [@Kaup83] (see also [@Chu05]) states that every surjective linear isometry between ${\rm JB}^*$-triples is a *Jordan triple homomorphism*, i.e., it preserves the Jordan triple product $$T\{x,y,z\}=\{Tx,Ty,Tz\}, \forall x,y,z\in E.$$ Hence, if $T$ is a surjective linear isometry between Hilbert $C^*$-modules, then $$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:triple}
T(x\langle y,z\rangle+z\langle y,x\rangle)=Tx\langle Ty,Tz\rangle+Tz\langle Ty,Tx\rangle, \forall x,y,z\in E.\end{aligned}$$ The equation (\[eq:triple\]) holds if and only if $$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:tri}
T(x\langle x,x\rangle)=Tx\langle Tx,Tx\rangle, \forall x\in E\end{aligned}$$ by triple polarization $$2\{x,y,z\}=\frac{1}{8}\sum\limits_{\alpha^4=\beta^2=1}
\alpha\beta \langle x+\alpha y+\beta z,x+\alpha y+\beta z\rangle(x+\alpha y+\beta z).$$

A ternary ring of operators (TRO) between two Hilbert spaces $H$ and $K$ is a linear subspace $\mathfrak{R}$

Infrared Spectroscopy
=====================

The reason for using IR spectroscopy is mainly that almost all biological marker molecules (i.e. biomarkers) will show some spectral features in the near to far IR ([@hand2005]). Furthermore, the spectroscopy will not destroy the sample (e.g. there is no contact with the sample, no contamination). Previous techniques of detection tended to destroy, or damage, the endolithes or the environment in which they lived (e.g. by using electron-microscope, chemical and biological or analysis).

Biomarkers are an important source of information in the search for evidence of life in geological samples. Even if the organisms are dead or dormant, it is still possible to detect their presence, byproducts or even their chemical alterations of the environment.

In searching for extraterrestrial life, it is important to have a minimum of preconception about them in order to find it.

Endolithes
==========

Endolithes are organisms that live inside rocks or in the pores between mineral grains. There are thousands of known species of endolithes, including members from Bacteria, Archaea, and Fungi. They represent near half the Earth’s biomass and also present an ideal model of life for Mars ([@ascaco2002], [@hand2005]).

This study used two groups of samples. One from the Guelph region (west of Toronto, Ontario) and the other near Eureka on the Ellesmere Island in the Nunavut ([@omelon2006]). Both regions have different geology and climate.

Methodology
===========

Samples were scanned using a technique called diffuse scattering. The IR beam was directed toward the sample and a series of mirrors redirected the scattered beam to the IR sensor. The spectra were obtained using an IR Nicolet spectrometer.

The apparatus used to collect the scattered IR beam could not receive large rock samples. It was necessary to break them into smaller pieces. The same device was very sensible to the angle of incidence and reflectance. It was important to position both mirrors near the vertical above the sample. The adjustment of each mirrors, in order to optimize the reception of light, was very time consuming. Those adjustments were performed using an aluminum plate as the sample to maximize the received flux to the sensor. When the rock sample was placed in the light path, the total flux drops a lot but the signal-to-noise ratio was high enough.

Spectra

3.  $Z_3=Z_2$ with $\omega_{Z_3}=2\omega_{Z_2}$ and with the diagonal $G$-action where $\iota_3(x)=([1:0],x)$.

It is not hard to show that $\iota_1^{-1}(Z_{1,G}^{ss})=\iota_2^{-1}
(Z_{2,G}^{ss})=\emptyset$ while $\iota_3^{-1}(Z_{3,G}^{ss})=
{\mathbb{P}}_1\setminus \{[1:0]\}$.

### The case of linear actions on projective manifolds {#subsubsect:algebraic_setup}

Let us recall the approach taken by Doran and Kirwan in [@DorKir]. There, the authors study the situation where $X$ is a subvariety of ${\mathbb{P}}(W)$ for some finite-dimensional $G$-module $W$ and they consider the embedding ${\hat{\iota}}\colon G\times_NX\hookrightarrow 
G\times_N{\mathbb{P}}(W)\cong(G/N)\times{\mathbb{P}}(W)$ that is induced by the embedding $\iota\colon X\hookrightarrow{\mathbb{P}}(W)$. Then, they equip $G\times_NX$ with the $G$-linearised ample line bundle $L:={\hat{\iota}}^*(\mathrm{pr}_1^*(\mathscr{O}_{G/N})\otimes 
\mathrm{pr}_2^*(\mathscr{O}_{{\mathbb{P}}(W)}(1)) )$. In this way, Doran and Kirwan can consider the set of Mumford-semistable points $(G\times_NX)^{ss}_G(L)$ in $G\times_NX$ and they proceed by defining the set of Mumford-semistable points in $X$ as $X^{ss}_N(L):=\iota^{-1}(G\times_NX)^{ss}_G(L)$, see [@DorKir Definition 5.1.5]. As shown in [@DorKir Propositions 5.1.8 and 5.1.9], this set $X^{ss}_N$ does not depend on the choice of the group $G$ and can be intrinsically defined knowing only the $N$-action on $X$.

### The definition of semistability

$$P=\left[ \left( x-\xi_0\right)^2+y^2\right]^{-\frac{1}{3}h_1+\frac{1}{6}h_{\rho}} \left[ \left( x-x_0\right)^2+y^2 \right]^{\frac{1}{3}h_1-\frac{1}{2}h_{\rho}} \left( x_0-\xi_0\right)^{-\frac{1}{3}h_1+\frac{1}{2}h_{\rho}}y^{\frac{1}{3}h_1+\frac{1}{6}h_{\rho}}g(\eta_1,\eta_2)
\label{LPP-CFT3}$$

in which we have considered two independent crossing ratios $\eta_1\equiv \frac{(z-\xi_0)(\bar{z}-x_0)}{y(x_0-\xi_0)}$ and $\eta_2\equiv \frac{(z-\xi_0)}{y}=\lim_{x^{\infty}\rightarrow\infty}\frac{(z-\xi_0)(\bar{z}-x^{\infty})}{y(x^{\infty}-\xi_0)}$. It would be more convenient to work with the dimensionless variables $a\equiv \frac{x-\xi_0}{y}$ and $b\equiv\frac{x-x_0}{x_0-\xi_0}$. It is not difficult to check that $P$ can be written in the following form:

$$P(x,y,\xi_0,x_0)= \left( \frac{1+b}{a(1+a^2)}\left(1+(\frac{ab}{1+b})^2\right) \right)^{\frac{1}{3}h_1} \left( \frac{a^3(1+a^2)}{(1+b)^2(1+\frac{ab}{1+b})^2)^3}\right)^{\frac{1}{6}h_\rho}g(a,b)
\label{LPP-CFT4}$$

From the above formula, one realizes that all coefficients can be absorbed in $g$ and so $P$ would be a function on $a$ and $b$, i.e. $P(x,y,\xi_0,x_

Hardness on graph classes {#sec:hardness}
=========================

In this section, we discuss some complexity results for [Min Bisection]{} and [Max Bisection]{}. In Section \[ssec:obtimal\], we have seen that there is a quite simple reduction from [MaxCut]{} to [Max Bisection]{}. We formally describe some immediate consequences of this reduction as follows. Let $\mathcal C$ be a graph class such that

-   [MaxCut]{} is NP-hard even if the input graph is restricted to be in $\mathcal C$ and

-   for every $G \in \mathcal C$, a graph $G'$ obtained from $G$ by adding arbitrary number of isolated vertices is also contained in $\mathcal C$.

The reduction shows that [Max Bisection]{} is NP-hard for every graph classes $\mathcal C$ that satisfies the above conditions.

\[thm:nph:max\] [Max Bisection]{} is NP-hard even for split graphs, comparability graphs, AT-free graphs, and claw-free graphs.

It is known that [MaxCut]{} is NP-hard even for split graphs [@Bodlaender::2000] and comparability graphs [@Pocai::2016], and co-bipartite graphs [@Bodlaender::2000] that is a subclass of AT-free graphs and claw-free graphs. If $\mathcal C$ is the class of co-bipartite graphs, the second condition does not hold in general. However, we can prove the hardness of [Max Bisection]{} on co-bipartite graphs, which will be discussed in the last part of this section.

Suppose the input graph $G$ has $2n$ vertices. Let $\overline{G}$ is the complement of $G$. It is easy to see that $G$ has a bisection of size at least $k$ if and only if $\overline{G}$ has a bisection of size at most $n^2 - k$. This immediately gives the following theorem from Theorem \[thm:nph:max\].

\[thm:nph:min\] [Min Bisection]{} is NP-hard even for split graphs and co-comparability graphs.

For bipartite graphs, [Max Cut]{} is solvable in polynomial time. However, we show that [Min Bisection]{} and [

We note that every endo-trivial structure is also retract-trivial. However, the reverse implication is not necessarily true: in Figure \[fig:Tournament6\] we give an example of a structure that is retract-trivial but not endo-trivial. This example is based on a digraph but is not itself a digraph. It is also possible to construct a retract-trivial digraph that is not endo-trivial [@Si17], but on reflexive tournaments both concepts do coincide.

A reflexive tournament is endo-trivial if and only if it is retract-trivial. \[lem:endo-retraction-trivial\]

(Forwards.) Trivial. (Backwards.) By contraposition, suppose $e$ is a non-trivial endomorphism of a reflexive tournament ${\ensuremath{\mathrm{H}}}$. Consider $e({\ensuremath{\mathrm{H}}})$ and build some function $e^{-1}$ from $e({\ensuremath{\mathrm{H}}})$ to ${\ensuremath{\mathrm{H}}}$ by choosing $e^{-1}(y)=x$ if $e(x)=y$ arbitrarily. Since ${\ensuremath{\mathrm{H}}}$ is a (reflexive) tournament, $e^{-1}$ is an isomorphism, whereupon $e^{-1} \circ e$ is the identity automorphism when restricted to some subtournament ${\ensuremath{\mathrm{H}}}_0$ of ${\ensuremath{\mathrm{H}}}$. Hence $e^{-1} \circ e$ is a non-trivial retraction of ${\ensuremath{\mathrm{H}}}$ (to ${\ensuremath{\mathrm{H}}}_0$).

Essential Unarity and a Dichotomy for Reflexive Directed Cycles {#sec:Benoit}
===============================================================

In this section we give the first concrete application, of which we are aware, of the aforementioned result of Chen, formally stated below.

Let ${\ensuremath{\mathrm{H}}}$ be a finite structure whose universe $V({\ensuremath{\mathrm{H}}})$ has size strictly greater than $1$. If each polymorphism of ${\ensuremath{\mathrm{H}}}$ is essentially unary, then [Surjective ${\ensuremath{\mathrm{H}}}$-Colouring]{} is [$\mathsf{NP}$]{}-complete. \[thm:Chen-hauptsatz\]

In order to this, we make use of the endomorphism graph and a result from Mároti and Zádori [@marz

$$L(\Omega_\Lambda, \alpha,\beta, v_0, r_s)=\prod\limits_i\frac{1}{(2\pi \sigma_i^2)^{1/2}}\exp(-\chi^2/2)$$

The probability for a particular $\Omega_\Lambda$ is calculated according to the following marginalization

$$P(\Omega_\Lambda)=\int  L(\Omega_\Lambda, \alpha,\beta, v_0, r_s) M(\Omega_\Lambda, \alpha,\beta, v_0, r_s)d\alpha d \beta d v_0 d r_s$$

![ The probability ration vs. $\Omega_\Lambda$. We marginalize $\alpha$, $\beta$, $v_0$ and $r_s$ parameters, and assume the prior probability function is a constant. $P_0$ is the maximum probability. []{data-label="like"}](like.eps){width="8cm"}

Here $M$ is a prior probability function. It depends on several parameters, but in general $M$ is assumed to be a constant. Figure \[like\] shows the likelihood ratio under this assumption. Again the small $\Omega_\Lambda$s are ruled out immediately. But we must emphasize that the minimum $\chi ^2$s appearing in $30\mbox{Mpc}<R_v<40\mbox{Mpc}$ and $40\mbox{Mpc}<R_v$ cases are not reasonable and therefore $M$ cannot be taken as only a constant. A further study of the prior probability is needed.

Conclusion
==========

In this paper, we studied the properties (orientation and density profiles) of the cosmological voids using the SDSS10 data. We first confirmed that the voids’ orientation is not purely random as one might naively expect. This effect has been first noticed by Foster etc[@Foster2009]. Later, Sutter etc. have found a constant empirical stretching factor using numerical simulations, and applied the stretching factor to SDSS DR10 data[@Sutter:2014oca; @Lavaux]. They found that the voids’ orientation can be used as
