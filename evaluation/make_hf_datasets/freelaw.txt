                             USDC No. 5:11-CR-770-2


Before JONES, DENNIS, and HAYNES, Circuit Judges.
PER CURIAM:*
        A jury convicted Artemio Lomas of one count of conspiracy to possess with
intent to distribute 1,000 kilograms or more of marijuana in violation of 21
U.S.C. §§ 846 and 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A) and two counts of possession with intent
to distribute 100 kilograms or more of marijuana in violation of § 841(a)(1),
(b)(1)(B). The district court sentenced Lomas to three concurrent terms of 151
months in prison. Lomas argues for the first time on appeal that the district

court erred in calculating the drug quantity attributable to him under the
Sentencing Guidelines by using the gross weight rather than the net weight.
      Because Lomas did not object in the district court to the drug quantity
attributed to him, our review is for plain error. United States v. Conn, 657 F.3d
280, 284 (5th Cir. 2011); United States v. Sparks, 2 F.3d 574, 589 (5th Cir. 1993).
Simply put, Lomas has not demonstrated that the court used the gross weight
rather than the net weight. Neither the trial testimony nor the presentence
report (PSR) referenced either gross weight or net weight. Furthermore, the
district court was entitled to rely on the jury’s finding that Lomas conspired to
possess with intent to distribute 1000 kilograms or more of marijuana and
Lomas’s admission that the facts in the PSR were correct. See United States v.

The amendments to the PACA trust provisions contained in this legislation are intended to strengthen and improve the operation of the trust and eliminate the *21 expense to USDA in administering these provisions. . . .
To enhance the operation of the trust, an alternate method of preserving trust benefits has been included in the bill. The current requirement to file a trust notice with the USDA is eliminated. Instead, the legislation makes clear that a licensee may use standard invoices or other billing statements to provide notice to the buyer of intent to preserve trust benefits . . .
Under current law, the trust is in effect at the time of shipment of the perishable commodity. The unpaid supplier, seller or agent must provide notice of trust coverage to the buyer in order to preserve these trust benefits. Consistent with this principle, this legislation, under paragraph 4 of section 5(c) of PACA, provides that the suppliers, seller, or agent may perfect its trust claim by giving notice to the buyer on the invoice or billing statement. This change to the Act provides both a convenience and cost savings to the unpaid supplier, seller or agent. The Committee intends the effect of notice provided through the use of usual billing or invoice statements to be the legal equivalent to the current practice of providing notice subsequent to the payment date by means independent of the billing statement or invoice. (Emphasis added).
It is quite clear that Congress' intent in adding § 499e(c)(4) was to provide a simpler and, for the government, a less expensive way for suppliers to preserve their trust rights. It is equally clear that Congress had no intent to redefine what constitutes the trust res under PACA. If Congress had intended to redefine or limit the trust res, it could have and should have amended § 499e(c)(2), which defines trust res, rather than dealing with the issue in a subsection relating only to preservation. In addition, the last sentence of the legislative history set forth above is very clear about the effect of the amendment  it says that the new method of trust preservation is the legal equivalent of the then current practice of filing notice set forth in subsection (c)(3). It says nothing about providing lesser or different protection through the new alternative manner of preservation. Clearly, if it had been Congress' intent to do what Kelly has asserted, the legislative history would not say that the new method of trust preservation is the legal equivalent of filing notice; moreover, the statute, or at least the legislative history, would have explicitly stated that the alternative method of preservation

On June 4, 2009, we notified Bourne=s
appellate counsel of our concern that we lacked jurisdiction over this appeal
because Bourne=s notice of appeal was not filed
in the trial court until May 4, 2009.[2]  We informed him that the appeal was subject
to dismissal for want of jurisdiction unless he filed a response on or before
June 15, 2009, advising us whether the mailbox rule would apply in this case.  See Tex. R. App. P. 9.2(b).  Bourne=s
appellate counsel=s reply, dated June 8, 2009, and
received by the court on June 9, 2009, fails to provide this court with a basis
to exercise jurisdiction.




A notice of appeal that complies with the
requirements of rule 26 of the rules of appellate procedure is essential to
vest this court with jurisdiction over an appeal.  See Tex. R. App. P. 26.2(a)(1); Slaton
v. State, 981 S.W.2d 208, 210 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998).  The court of criminal appeals has expressly
held that without a timely filed notice of appeal or motion for extension of
time, we cannot exercise jurisdiction over an appeal.  See Olivo v. State, 918 S.W.2d 519, 522
(Tex. Crim. App. 1996) (AWhen a notice of appeal is filed
within the fifteen‑day period [in rule 26.3] but no timely motion for
extension of time is filed, the appellate court lacks jurisdiction.@).  Here, we lack jurisdiction to dispose of the
purported appeal in any manner other than by dismissing it for lack of
jurisdiction.  See id. at

[1]See Tex.

We are not impressed with the construction urged by defendant that it was intended during the interim we should have a legislature with an increased Senate membership but with an unchanged House apportionment. To say the new offices are created and the term thereof becomes presently effective (the vacancy thus resulting to be filled by appointment), would in our opinion be in direct conflict with the plain language of the amendment, and the result would be to deprive the people in the nine counties granted an additional senator, of the privilege of exercising their electoral franchise to select the person to fill the office. We believe this was never the intent of the electorate, for they have ever jealously guarded their right to elect their public officials and vested the appointing power in other hands only in exceptional cases. For example, see Chapter 135, Laws 1947 (now Section 19-210 of the 1952 Cumulative Supplement), enlarging the membership of the Supreme Court. A departure from this policy would have to be declared in clearer words than are here found.
Furthermore, we note that the amendment was proposed by a concurrent resolution of the legislature, and therein it was *400 provided that it should be submitted to a vote of the people at the next regular general election, or at a special election called for that purpose. This meant that possibly there would be no submission to the electorate until November, 1954, which indicates the legislature never intended there be any term other than the regular two-year term provided for by Article 4, Part 2, Section 21, of the Constitution, which reads:
"The members of the first legislature shall hold office until the first Monday in January, 1913. The terms of office of the members of succeeding legislatures shall be two years."
It appears that another court has reached a similar conclusion upon a comparable fact situation. In State ex rel. Sanchez v. Dixon, La. App., 4 So.2d 591, 595, the issue presented was whether the governor could appoint as interim appointments, four additional police jurors, under an act authorizing the creation of these offices upon varying population increases. The court said:
"The general rule is that, where no time is fixed for the beginning of the term of an elective office, it begins at the time the office is filled by an election, and if the office is an appointive one, the term begins when the appointment is made. So, where an election is necessary, the term does not begin until after that election is held. 46 C.J., pages 965, 966; 22 R

                                   I. COMPLIANCE WITH ANDERS2

        Pursuant to Anders v. California, Thomas's counsel filed a brief and a motion to

withdraw with this Court stating that he has diligently reviewed the appellate record and

that, in his opinion, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. See 386 U.S. 738, 744-45

(1967). Counsel's brief meets the requirements of Anders as it presents a professional

evaluation showing why there are no non-frivolous grounds for advancing an appeal.

att

       In Olive/Metts, this Court stated:

       [b]ecause “a child’s placement with relatives weighs against termination under
       MCL 712A.19a(6)(a),” the fact that a child is living with relatives when the case
       proceeds to termination is a factor to be considered in determining whether
       termination is in the child’s best interests. Although the trial court may terminate
       parental rights in lieu of placement with relatives if it finds that termination is in
       the child’s best interests, the fact that the children are in the care of a relative at
       the time of the termination hearing is an “explicit factor to consider in
       determining whether termination was in the children’s best interests[.]” A trial
       court’s failure to explicitly address whether termination is appropriate in light of
       the children’s placement with relatives renders the factual record inadequate to
       make a best-interest determination and requires reversal. [In re Olive/Metts, 297
       Mich App at 43 (emphasis added; citations omitted).]

        In this case, respondent’s argument that the trial court failed to consider the children’s
relative placement at the time of the termination hearing is belied by the trial court’s opinion.
Contrary to respondent’s argument, the trial court acknowledged the children’s relative
placement several times, and made reference to the issues respondent had with that placement.
Specifically, the trial court referenced the foster care worker’s testimony that

       Father has had a problem with the relative placement and has made things
       difficult in this regard, which is troubling to her. He has requested multiple times
       that Minors be moved from their placement despite the girls doing well. During a
       family team meeting, Father made enough inappropriate comments that Ms.
       Killip[s] had to conclude the meeting.

The trial court concluded that respondent was unlikely to rectify any of the conditions that
brought the children into care, in part because of his continued angry and aggressive behavior.
The trial court also noted that the children had made improvements in the foster home, and
needed permanency and stability in a suitable home environment.

       The record therefore establishes that the trial court considered the children’s relative
placement at the time of the termination hearing. Moreover, given that respondent repeatedly
refused to facilitate the children’s

       he was convicted of operating while intoxicated in Cause No. 341 for the same

       conduct that was charged in Count III of Cause No. 40 relating to the events

       that occurred on August 30, 2013. He asserts that the charges of aggravated

       battery, resisting law enforcement, and operating a vehicle while intoxicated in

       Cause No. 40 all occurred within a few minutes.


[38]   The State argues that this case is not within the scope of the successive

       prosecution statute because it did not file a new additional charge against Hahn,




       4
        Hahn mentions Ind. Criminal Rule 4(C), but does not develop an argument. Accordingly, this issue is
       waived.

       and that Hahn did not provide the trial court or this Court with a record of

       Cause No. 341. The State also argues that his argument fails even if the

       successive prosecution statute applies because his intoxicated driving as charged

       under Cause No. 341 was temporally distinct and involved different conduct

       and bore no necessary relationship to the conduct alleged in Counts I and II in

       Cause No. 40.


[39]   Because Hahn appeals the trial court’s denial of a motion to dismiss, we review

       the trial court’s decision for an abuse of discretion. Thompson v. State, 966

       N.E.2d 112, 117 (Ind. Ct. App. 2012) (citing Haywood v. State, 875 N.E.2d 770,

       772 (Ind. Ct. App. 2007)), trans. denied. An abuse of discretion occurs when the

       trial court’s decision is clearly against the logic and effect of the facts and

       circumstances before it, or when the court misinterprets the law. Id. Ind. Code

       § 35-34-1-8 governs motions to dismiss by a defendant and provides in part that

       “[t]he defendant has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence

       every fact essential to support the motion.” Ind. Code § 35-34-1-8(f). “Because

       the defendant has the burden of proof, the denial of his motion is a negative

       ruling, reversible only if the evidence

Commission and Chief Election Officer's motion for

reconsideration and/or clarification of the January 4, 2012 order

and the January 6, 2012 opinion granting the petition for a writ

of mandamus, the papers in support and the record, it appears

that the lack of complete information about the non-permanent

status and location of Hawaii's non-residents is no basis for

disregarding the express mandate of the Hawai'i Constitution,

article IV, section 4, that only permanent residents be counted

in the population base for the purpose of reapportionment of the
state legislature.


           It further appears that the January 6, 2012 opinion


discussed and disposed of the sole issue presented in


petitioner's petition as to whether the inclusion of non­

permanent residents in the population base for the 2011 Final


Reapportionment Plan constituted an error in the Reapportionment


Plan.   How the Commission identifies the non-permanent resident


population for apportionment under article IV, section 4 and


whether the Commission must follow the procedures set forth in


HRS § 25-2 in preparing and filing a new reapportionment plan


were not issues in petitioner's mandamus proceeding.


           It finally appears that the January 6, 2012 opinion

Robert A. Butterworth, Atty. Gen., and Jorge Espinosa, Asst. Atty. Gen., for appellee.
Before HUBBART, NESBITT and JORGENSON, JJ.
PER CURIAM.
The defendant, Miguel Angel Fernandez, appeals from a final judgment of conviction and sentence of life imprisonment for burglary of a structure with an assault or battery with a firearm, robbery with a firearm, and kidnapping with a firearm. We affirm the judgment of conviction. However, because the trial court erred in applying the sentencing guidelines, we remand for resentencing within the guidelines range.
First, we hold that the trial court did not err in excluding as hearsay two out-of-court statements relating to defendant's alibi defense. No offer of proof was made to indicate what the excluded evidence would have revealed. The Florida Evidence Code, Section 90.104(1)(b), Florida Statutes, provides:
(1) A court may predicate error, set aside or reverse a judgment, or grant a new trial on the basis of admitted or excluded evidence when a substantial right of the party is adversely affected and:
* * * * * *
(b) When the ruling is one excluding evidence, the substance of the evidence was made known to the court by offer of proof or was apparent from the context within which the questions were asked.
"It is axiomatic that failure to proffer what the excluded evidence would have revealed precludes appellate consideration of the alleged error." A.McD. v. State, 422 So.2d 336, 337 Fla. 3d DCA 1982) (citations omitted). Although we assume that the testimony would have been favorable to the defendant, we cannot speculate as to what that testimony would have been. See A.McD., 422 So.2d at 336. ("The bare question, `Have you ever been subject to any disciplinary investigations?' provides no insight as to its relevancy."); Woodson *439 v. State, 483 So.2d 858, 859 (Fla. 5th DCA 1986) ("The witness' response was not `apparent' from the context of the question.")
The absence of proffer in the present case precludes our review of the alleged error. Because Fernandez does not contend that the answers sought from Officer Vermillion were also inherent in the questions asked, the absence of proffer precludes our review of that alleged error as well.
Second, no error occurred when John Kastrenakas, the

RIDGE, District Judge.
On reconsideration of a Division No. 5 order favorable to petitioners' application for a certificate of convenience and necessity as a contract motor carrier, the Interstate Commerce Commission (two members dissenting and one member not participating) found "that applicants (petitioners) * * * have failed to show that the proposed operation will be consistent with the public interest and the national transportation policy, and that the application should be denied." Petitioners brought the instant review action to annul, set aside and enjoin said order. We have jurisdiction in the premises by virtue of Sections 1336, 1398, 2284, and 2321-2325, Title 28, U.S.C.A.
In their complaint, petitioners allege that the report and order of the I.C.C. so entered is unjust, arbitrary, unreasonable and without any basis in fact or law, in that the I.C.C. erroneously (a) considered a certificate of convenience and necessity of Frozen Food Express, a protesting motor carrier in the proceeding, which was issued subsequent to the date of filing of petitioners' *818 application with the Commission; (b) considered the operating authority of Frozen Food Express and Refrigerated Transport, Inc., when said carriers did not petition for reconsideration of the Division No. 5 order; (c) considered the operating authority of Refrigerated Transport a protesting motor carrier which was not placed in the record; (d) and the operations of Refrigerated Transport thereunder when that motor carrier submitted no evidence as to its fitness, operations and equipment, to reasonably provide the supporting shipper with adequate motor carrier service; (e) considered a trip-lease arrangement of Frozen Food and Refrigerated Transport when the agreement relating thereto was not in the record before the Commission; (f) and was in fact shown to be an illegal operation by said motor carriers; (g) in incorrectly interpreting and construing the scope of operating authority of Frozen Food as a common carrier; (h) and failed to consider petitioners' challenge of the Examiner's qualifications that heard and granted the application of Frozen Food for such authority; (i and j) considered rail service as being direct and adequate to meet the particular needs of the supporting shipper when no evidence was offered by rail protestants and connecting rail carriers in respect to their willingness and ability to meet the particular needs of such shipper; and (k) in not finding as matter of law that the supporting shipper

    Merardo Alcaraz-Diaz appeals the sentence imposed following

his guilty plea conviction of being found in the United States

after deportation/removal in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1326.

Alcaraz contends that 8 U.S.C. § 1326(a) and 8 U.S.C. § 1326(b)

define separate offenses.    He argues that the prior conviction

that resulted in his increased sentence is an element of a

separate offense under 8 U.S.C. § 1326(b) that should have been

alleged in his indictment.   Alcaraz maintains that he pleaded

guilty to an indictment which charged only simple reentry under

8 U.S.C. § 1326(a).    He argues that his sentence exceeds the

two-year maximum term of imprisonment which may be imposed for

that offense.

       In Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224, 235

(1998), the Supreme Court held that the enhanced penalties in

8 U.S.C. § 1326(b) are sentencing provisions, not elements of

separate offenses.    The Court further held that the sentencing

provisions do not violate the Due Process Clause.     Id. at 239-47.

Almendarez-Torres, but asserts that the decision has been cast

into doubt by Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U

Appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of ArkansasBefore LOKEN, FAGG, and HANSEN, Circuit Judges.
PER CURIAM.


1
Four Arkansas inmates appeal the district court's dismissal without prejudice of their 42 U.S.C.  1983 action filed against various prison officials challenging various conditions of their confinement. The district court1 dismissed the suit under 42 U.S.C.  1997e(a) for failure to exhaust available prison administrative remedies. In their pro se brief on appeal, plaintiffs admit "that they made a mistake in prematurely filing their lawsuit," but argue that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the suit without prejudice because their prison grievances were in process when the suit was filed, and some grievances were administratively denied before the district court ruled.


2
Section 1997e(a) provides that "[n]o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under [ 1983] by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted." When multiple prison condition claims have been joined, as in this case, the plain language of  1997e(a) requires that all available prison grievance remedies must be exhausted as to all of the claims. Here, it is apparent that at least some of the plaintiffs' many claims were not fully exhausted at the time the district court dismissed the action without prejudice.

Defendants filed a motion requesting an initial hearing en banc to consider whether our decision in Williams v. Norris, 176 F.3d 1089, 1090 (8th Cir. 1999) -- that it is improper to dismiss without prejudice when available prison administrative remedies are exhausted "at the time the [district] court ruled" -- is contrary to the plain language of  1997e(a) ("no action shall be brought"), as construed by a number of our sister circuits. See, e.g., Perez v. Wisconsin Dept. of Corrections, 182 F.3d 532, 534- 35 (7th Cir. 1999); Brown v. Toombs, 139 F.3d 1102, 1104 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 833 (1998); cf. Underwood v. Wilson, 151 F.3d 292, 296 (5th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1133 (1999). We need not address that issue because it is clear from the record

PER CURIAM:

               Leon    Eugene       Grayson         seeks       to    appeal         the     district

court’s       order    accepting      the      recommendation              of    the       magistrate

judge       and    denying       relief   on     his       28    U.S.C.          §    2254      (2006)

petition.          The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice

or    judge       issues    a    certificate        of   appealability.                    28   U.S.C.

§ 2253(c)(1) (2006).               A certificate of appealability will not

issue       absent     “a       substantial      showing             of    the       denial     of   a

constitutional right.”              28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2) (2006).                          When the

district court denies relief on the merits, a prisoner satisfies

this       standard    by    demonstrating          that    reasonable               jurists     would

find that the district court’s assessment of the constitutional

claims is debatable or wrong.                   Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473,

484    (2000);       see    Miller-El     v.    Cockrell,            537    U.S

       Sheriff Brice called Martinez and asked him to meet with Springer at the courthouse for an

interview. Martinez was not informed of hisMiranda rights or his rights under the Texas Code of

Criminal Procedure prior to this interview. During the interview, Martinez told Springer of three

instances of sexual conduct withthe complainant. Thefirst instance Martinez reported occurred at

Martinez's shop. Martinez said the complainant performed oral sex on him. After this admission,

Martinez reported a second instance that occurred when Martinez's family and the complainant's

family were vacationing together. Martinez said the complainant beganto performoral sex on him

but Martinez interrupted and stopped it. Martinez also reported a third instancethat occurred at the

complainant's house. Martinez said the complainant again performed oral sex on him, and

Martinez then penetrated the complainant's anus with his penis. At the end of the interview,

Springer gave Martinez the Miranda and Texas statutory warnings and then asked Martinez to

reduce his oral statements to writing. Martinez did so, and Springer arrested him.

       Martinez was charged with two counts of sexual assault against a child. See TEX. Penal

Code Ann. § 22.011(a)(2) (West 2011). One count alleged Martinez intentionally or knowingly

caused the penetration of the complainant's mouth with Martinez's sexual organ. See id.

 § 22.011(a)(2)(B). The other count alleged Martinez intentionally or knowingly caused the
 penetration ofthe complainant's anus with Martinez's sexual organ. See id. §22.011(a)(2)(A). The
jury convicted Martinez and assessed his punishment at five years' imprisonment for the first
count, and ten years' imprisonment for the second count. The trial court ordered Martinezto serve

his sentences consecutively.

                                     Motion to Suppress

        Martinez contends the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress all oral and

written statements stemming from the interview with Springer. He argues the oral statements
should be suppressed because they were the product of a custodial interrogation and he was not
giventhe warningsrequired by Miranda v. Arizona and article 38.22 ofthe Texas Code ofCriminal

Procedure prior to the interview. Martinez also argues his written statements should have

The review is of the record as a whole, and the administrative order is to be sustained if it appears, upon that review, that substantial evidence supports the findings.  Universal Camera Corporation v. National Labor Relations Board,  340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456; O'Leary, Deputy Commissioner, v. Brown-Pacific Maxon, Inc., 340 U.S. 504, 71 S.Ct. 470, 95 L.Ed. 483.  Questions of credibility are for the Deputy Commissioner to determine.  National Labor Relations Board v. Walton Manufacturing Co., 369 U.S. 404, 82 S.Ct. 853, 7 L.Ed.2d 829.  The burden of showing that the accident caused an acceleration of the death of the employee was upon the claimant.  Gooding v. Willard, 2nd Cir.1954, 209 F.2d 913.


9
If the whole record has within it the substantial evidence that is required to sustain the finding, that evidence must be found in the testimony of Dr. James G. Jones.  He was a specialist in internal medicine and at the time of the hearing had been practicing for a year in the City of Houston.  He had never examined Gee and so his testimony was based upon the clinical and hospital records, upon X-rays and upon the hypotheses incorporated in the questions of counsel.  The doctor expressed the opinion that the fertilizer masked Gee's true condition and delayed a diagnosis of cancer so that it progressed beyond the stage at which treatment might have been given which probably would have prolonged his life by as much as two or three months.  If his life was not prolonged, it can be said that his death was accelerated.  But this is not all that Dr. Jones said in his testimony.  The prolongation of Gee's life would probably have resulted if there had been an early diagnosis of cancer.  He 'guessed' that the pleural effusion, which he opined was masked by the effect of the fertilizer incident, had existed for several weeks prior to the incident. On cross-examination he gave an affirmative answer to this question,

'And the only thing that you are in a position to say now, as I understand it, is that had it not been for the fertilizer incident, there is a possibility that the cancerous condition would have been discovered at an earlier date and there is then a

[1]  The order sustaining demurrer reads in pertinent part: "The matter is duly argued and submitted to the court for consideration and decision and the court after due consideration orders said demurrer sustained on grounds that the complaint fails to state a cause of action." The trial court made no ruling on the second ground of the demurrer although respondents seek to justify the court's order and judgment of dismissal on that ground also. We note the demurrer does not specify the name of the "indispensable party" (Kreling v. Kreling, 118 Cal. 413, 420 [50 P. 546]) although supporting points and authorities referred to "the county." Thus in the light of this, the order sustaining the demurrer and the absence of any mention therein of the second ground we cannot speculate whether the trial court considered the second ground of the demurrer and if it did, whether it found it to be a valid one.

Code, designating certain offices to be located "at" the county seat], and the preceding sections upon which they are based, it intended that all of the business of these offices be conducted within the original boundaries of some particular city in the event that such original boundaries had been fixed prior to 1878, but that the Legislature did permit business to be conducted outside the original boundaries where by happenstance those boundaries were not fixed at the time of the original designation.

Motion for Transfer to Supreme Court Denied March 1, 2005.
ROBERT G. ULRICH, Judge.
Frank Nease appeals the decision of the Labor and Industrial Relations Commission disqualifying him from unemployment benefits for six weeks. The appeal is dismissed as moot.
Mr. Nease applied for unemployment benefits after he was discharged by his employer, Independent Living Resource Center, Inc. A deputy with the Division of Employment Security determined that Mr. Nease was disqualified for benefits for four weeks because he was discharged for misconduct connected with work. Mr. Nease appealed, and the Appeals Tribunal modified the deputy's determination deciding that Mr. Nease was disqualified for benefits for six weeks. Mr. Nease then appealed to the Commission, which affirmed the decision of the Appeals Tribunal. This appeal followed.
The Division filed a motion to dismiss Mr. Nease's appeal, which was taken with the case, arguing that no justifiable issue exists, and, therefore, Mr. Nease's case is now moot. It contends that Mr. Nease has received the maximum amount of unemployment benefits and cannot receive any additional benefits should he prevail on appeal. Mr. Nease responded to the motion arguing that dismissal of his appeal would deprive him of the liberty interest in his good name and judicial review of the decision of the Division finding that he engaged in misconduct at work. He also argues that his case presents issues of general importance that are likely to recur yet evade judicial review.
A case is moot when the question presented for decision seeks a judgment upon some matter that, if the judgment is rendered, would not have any practical effect upon any then existing controversy.

OPINION

PER CURIAM:

Murray Alan Coats appeals a decision of the district court denying
his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, see 28 U.S.C.A. § 2254 (West
1994 & Supp. 1997), which challenged his North Carolina convic-
tions. Coats argues that the district court applied an incorrect standard
of review in considering the decision of the state postconviction court.
Coats further contends that the district court erred in denying him
relief on the basis of violations of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83
(1963), and ineffective assistance of counsel. Finding no error, we
affirm.

I.

Coats was convicted in 1989 by a North Carolina court on two
counts of first-degree sexual offense, see N.C. Gen. Stat. § 14-27.4
(1993), and one count of second-degree kidnapping, see N.C. Gen.
Stat. § 14-39 (1993). Coats' victim testified that she was working at
a convenience store when Coats forced her at gunpoint to leave the
store and accompany him to a barn where he forced her to remove her
clothes and perform oral sex on him for an hour or more. She also tes-
tified that Coats penetrated her vagina with his finger. Coats' convic-
tions were affirmed by the North Carolina Court of Appeals, and the
North Carolina Supreme Court denied discretionary review.

In 1993, having obtained new counsel, Coats filed a motion for
appropriate relief in the Wake County Superior Court asserting that

                    2
his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective, that Coats had dis-
covered evidence having a direct and material bearing upon his inno-
cence, and that the prosecutor had engaged in misconduct by failing
to disclose the evidence. An evidentiary hearing was held in Decem-
ber 1994, after which the state-court judge denied Coats' motion,
finding in pertinent part that trial counsel was not constitutionally
ineffective, that the newly discovered evidence was not material, and
that the prosecutor had not engaged in misconduct. The North Caro-
lina Court of Appeals then denied certiorari. Coats subsequently filed
this petition for a writ of habeas corpus in January 1997, and the dis-
trict court granted summary judgment against him

Walter Powers (Daniel Needham & Walter White with him) for the plaintiff.
Philander S. Ratzkoff (Roger B. Coulter with him) for the defendants.
CUTTER, J.
The authority's bill in equity seeks declaratory relief against Perini Corporation (Perini) and also against an insurance company (the insurer, see fn. 1) which had issued to Perini a comprehensive liability insurance policy. The policy named Perini as insured and the authority and the trustee (fn. 1) as additional insureds. A judge of the Superior Court, without making any decision, reserved the case for the determination of this court upon the pleadings and a case stated.
In 1959, the authority (acting under St. 1958, c. 598) made a contract with Perini (drafted by the authority) to construct an additional traffic tunnel (now known as the Lieutenant Callahan Tunnel) under Boston harbor, to modernize the existing Sumner Tunnel, and to combine the two tunnels as a single project. The contract (art. 26) provided that Perini "shall indemnify and save harmless the [a]uthority and ... its officers, ... and employees against all suits, claims or liability of every name and nature, for or on account of any injuries to persons or damage to property arising out of or in consequence of the acts of ... [Perini] in the performance of the work covered by the contract and/or [sic] failure to comply with ... [its] terms... whether by himself or his employees or sub-contractors, but only in respect of such injuries or damages sustained ... prior to the completion and acceptance of the work ... [emphasis supplied in the original *450 exhibit]." Certain other relevant contract provisions are summarized in the margin.[2]
The insurer issued the comprehensive liability insurance policy mentioned above. As amended, the relevant coverage (insuring agreement 1, coverage D, property damage liability) read, "To pay on behalf of the [i]nsured all sums which the [i]nsured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages for: (a) [p]hysical injury to or destruction of tangible property, or (b) [l]oss of use of such tangible property, provided the physical injury thereto was caused by accident."[3] The policy also required the insurer to "defend any suit ... against the insured alleging such ... injury or destruction and seeking damages which are payable under ... this policy

4
This case is controlled by Stone v. Powell, 428 U.S. 465, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976), and its progeny.  In Stone v. Powell, the Supreme Court held that


5
where the State has provided an opportunity for full and fair litigation of a Fourth Amendment claim, a state prisoner may not be granted federal habeas corpus relief on the ground that evidence obtained in an unconstitutional search or seizure was introduced at trial.


6
Id. at 494, 96 S.Ct. at 3052.  Petitioner contends the knife should have been excluded as the fruit of an unconstitutional search and seizure.  Relying on Stone v. Powell, the federal district court held petitioner was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing and denied his petition for writ of habeas corpus.


7
The record does not show that petitioner moved to suppress the pocket knife prior to trial in the state courts.  From the record it is apparent, however, that he objected to the introduction of this evidence at trial and that the court admitted the evidence over his objection.  Petitioner subsequently presented this issue on direct appeal.  McDaniel v. State, 509 P.2d at 681.  Furthermore, the legality of the search and seizure producing the pocket knife was considered in a full evidentiary hearing conducted on his application for post-conviction relief pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. XXII, §§ 1080 Et seq.  (1971).  The denial of post-conviction relief was affirmed on appeal to the Oklahoma Criminal Court of Appeals.


8
We are convinced by our careful examination of the record that the state provided and petitioner received an opportunity to fully and fairly litigate his Fourth Amendment claims.  Petitioner's primary complaint on this appeal is that the Oklahoma Criminal Court of Appeals skirted the illegal search and seizure issue when it refused to rule directly on the admissibility of the pocket knife, and entered a harmless error ruling as follows:


9
Defendant lastly contends that the trial court erred in allowing the introduction of the pocket knife found on the front seat of defendant's car after defendant had been arrested and taken into custody.  . . .  A reasonable view of the record indicates other substantial evidence from which the jury could find the defendant guilty.  It is thus apparent that the jury could not have been prejudiced by the admittance of the pocket knife.

McDaniel v. State,

California that a criminal defendant also has the right to waive counsel and represent himself.

Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 818-20, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 2532-33, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975);

Hatten, 71 S.W.3d at 333. To be constitutionally effective, such a decision must be made

competently, voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently. Godinez v. Moran, 509 U.S. 389, 400,

113 S.Ct. 2680, 2687, 125 L.Ed.2d 321 (1993); Faretta, 422 U.S. at 835-36, 95 S.Ct. at 2541.

The decision is made knowingly and intelligently if made with a full understanding of the right

to counsel, which is being abandoned, as well as the dangers and disadvantages of self-

representation. Faretta, 422 U.S. at 835-36, 95 S.Ct. at 2541; Williams v. State, 252 S.W.3d 353,

356 (Tex.Crim.App. 2008).

       The Court of Criminal Appeals has held on several occasions that there is no

constitutional right to hybrid representation. See e.g., Dunn v. State, 819 S.W.2d 510, 525-26

(Tex.Crim.App. 1991); Scarbrough v. State, 777 S.W.2d 83, 92 (Tex.Crim.App. 1989); Landers

v. State, 550 S.W.2d 272, 280 (Tex.Crim.App. 1977). In Scarbrough, the Court of Criminal

Appeals held that the admonishments regarding the dangers and disadvantages of self-

representation should include making the accused aware that there is no right to standby counsel.

Scarbrough, 777 S.W.2d at 93. If the defendant asserts a desire for self-representation, but also

indicates he would prefer what actually amounts to hybrid representation, the trial court should

decide at the earliest practicable moment whether to allow it, and if not, should inform the

defendant he must choose instead between two mutually exclusive rights--the right to self-

representation

Before JOE SPURLOCK, II, HILL and FARRIS, JJ.


*278 OPINION
HILL, Justice.
Relator, George Joseph Oliver, brings us this application for writ of habeas corpus, complaining that he is being unlawfully confined in the Tarrant County jail pursuant to findings that he was in contempt of court for his failure to make payments of temporary support pursuant to temporary orders and pursuant to his final divorce decree, pending appeal. He contends that the trial court erred in finding him guilty of contempt for failing to make payments on April 25, 1987, a date not specifically alleged in the motion for contempt; that he could not be punished for contempt because thirty days had not elapsed from the date the April 25, 1987 payment was due until the motion for contempt was filed; that he could not be found in violation of temporary orders entered April 24, 1986, because they were superseded by the final decree of December 17, 1986; that temporary orders contained in the final divorce decree are unenforceable because they were not entered in accordance with TEX. FAM.CODE ANN. secs. 3.58(h) and 3.59 (Vernon Supp.1987); and that the presumption of his ability to pay constitutes a violation of his right to due process of law.
We reject the majority of Oliver's contentions and order him remanded to the custody of the Tarrant County Sheriff.
Oliver's first contention is that the trial court erred by finding him guilty of contempt for failing to make payments on April 25, 1987, a date not specifically alleged in the motion for contempt. He does not complain that he did not receive notice of the specifically alleged violation of March 25, 1987.
A motion for contempt is comparable to an indictment or information and complaint charging several different misdemeanors. Ex parte Loreant, 464 S.W.2d 223, 224 (Tex.Civ.App.Houston [1st Dist.] 1971, no writ). Punishment for more than one act of contempt is possible in one proceeding only if the motion for contempt sets out specifically distinct and separate violations of the order. Id.
In the case at bar, the motion for contempt alleges the following:
Respondent has disobeyed the Order and Decree as follows: Respondent failed to pay the required temporary support for March 25, 1987. If Respondent fails to make any other payment for temporary support before the time the Court considers this Motion for Contempt, then the Court should also consider any such

     BEFORE PRATHER, C.J., SMITH AND WALLER, JJ.


     SMITH, JUSTICE, FOR THE COURT:


¶1. David B. Corry and Paul J. Corry appeal to this court their convictions from a trial de novo
without a jury in the Circuit Court of Amite County. On November 25, 1995 David Corry and Paul J.
Corry were charged with various hunting violations. Specifically, David Corry was charged with the
criminal offenses of hunting deer without orange, hunting deer over bait, and hunting deer without a
license. Paul Corry was charged with the criminal offenses of hunting deer without orange and
hunting without a license. On a first impression issue, we determine that § 49-7-33, our "baiting"
statute is constitutional. There is no merit to any of the issues raised by the Corry's.

¶2. The following sequence of events led up to the charges filed against the Corrys.

                                               FACTS

¶3. Sometime around October 7, 1995, Mississippi Wildlife and Fisheries conservation officer Donald
Foreman received information from a confidential source that someone was hunting deer over ground
baited with shelled corn on Micheal Cupit's(1) land. Subsequently, on November 25, 1995, Officer
Foreman, accompanied by Officer Ricky Long, went to the location where the hunting violations
were allegedly occurring. In order to reach the Cupit property, the officers crossed over land owned
by Merkle Brady and E. L. Caston. Officer Long testified that while standing on land adjacent to
Cupit's, he observed an individual on Cupit's land in a tree stand (approximately 15 to 20 feet off the
ground) with a gun but not wearing orange. Officer Long then entered Cupit's land and ascertained
that the individual in the tree stand was Paul Corry. Officer Foreman testified that he had already
crossed onto Cupit's land when Officer Long made him aware of the individual in the tree stand. The
defendants noted this difference in testimony. The remaining facts are not in controversy.

¶4. Paul Corry told the officers that his brother, David Corry, was also hunting somewhere on the
Cupit property. There was no corn found around Paul, therefore, he was only charged with hunting
deer without orange and hunting without a valid license

David L. Kreeger argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were Solicitor General McGrath, Assistant Attorney General Sonnett and John R. Benney.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.
In 1942 the Government owed the petitioner a $3,104.87 refund of processing and floor taxes paid by the petitioner under the Agricultural Adjustment Act. The petitioner owed the Reconstruction Finance Corporation $5,963.51, balance on a note for borrowed money. The General Accounting Office directed the Treasury not to pay the tax refund to the petitioner, but to issue a check for the refund payable to the R.F.C. "to partially liquidate" petitioner's indebtedness to that governmental agency. As *538 authorized by 28 U.S.C. 250 (1), the petitioner then brought suit against the Government for the tax refund in the Court of Claims. The Government filed a counterclaim for the $5,963.51, asserting the right to do so under 28 U.S.C. 250 (2), which gives the Court of Claims jurisdiction to hear and determine "All set-offs, counterclaims, . . . or other demands whatsoever on the part of the Government of the United States against any claimant against the Government in said court . . ." The petitioner challenged the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims to hear and determine the counterclaim on these two grounds: (1) the Comptroller exceeded his authority in directing the Treasury to pay the tax refund to the R.F.C. instead of to the petitioner; (2) the R.F.C. should be treated in the same way as a privately owned corporation and when so treated the petitioner's admittedly valid indebtedness to R.F.C. is not a claim "on the part of the Government" entitling it to set up a counterclaim under 28 U.S.C. 250 (2). The Court of Claims, rejecting both these contentions, rendered judgment for the United States and against the petitioner for the amount it owed the R.F.C. less the amount of the tax refund. We granted certiorari.
Little need be said as to the contention concerning the alleged lack of authority of the General Accounting Office to direct the Treasury not to pay the petitioner, since we agree with the Court of Claims that its jurisdiction to hear and determine counterclaims is in no way dependent upon the preliminary intragovernmental steps which precede court action.

I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

Doretha Smaw was first employed as a Virginia State Trooper in 1982. Compl. ¶ 2. At the time of her hiring, she weighed 219 pounds. Blankenship Aff. ¶ 7. Although Smaw's weight exceeded the maximum weight allowable under the personnel guidelines of the VSP, she was accepted as a trooper with the understanding that she would reach the appropriate weight during her employment. Id.
During her nine-year tenure as a trooper, Smaw received numerous written warnings from her supervisors about the fact that her weight remained in excess of the maximum weight limitation. Compl. ¶ 15-66. In August of 1988, Smaw was examined by a VSP doctor, who found that no medical reason prevented her from reaching the prescribed weight. Def.Mem.Supp.Summ.J. ¶ 3b. The doctor suggested several ways for Smaw to attain the desired weight, and recommended that she lose three pounds per month until she reached a satisfactory weight. Id.
Pursuant to that program, Smaw was weighed monthly. Smaw was consistently unable to meet the three-pound-per-month program, and, in 1991, she was terminated from employment as a trooper. Id. at ¶ 3c.

II. STANDARD FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

Under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment should be granted only if "there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the ... moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). For the evidence to present a "genuine" issue of material fact, it must be "such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). Facts are deemed material if they might affect the outcome of the case. Celotex Corp. v.

       During the last few years of his employment with the County of Fresno (County),
appellant Gary Johnson, was on assignment in Sacramento County. The County paid
appellant a flat monthly allowance on top of his regular salary to cover appellant’s out-of-
town living expenses.
       When appellant retired, respondent, the Fresno County Employees’ Retirement
Association (FCERA), calculated appellant’s pension without including this flat monthly
allowance as part of appellant’s final compensation. Appellant filed a claim with the
FCERA seeking to have the flat monthly allowance included in his pension calculation.
The FCERA denied appellant’s claim and declared the flat monthly allowance was not
pensionable.
       Appellant then filed a petition for writ of mandate in the trial court. The trial court
denied appellant’s petition on the ground that appellant’s claim was barred by a class
action settlement agreement. The court did not rule on whether the flat monthly
allowance is “compensation earnable” and therefore included in the final compensation
calculation. (Gov. Code,1 §§ 31461, 31462.)
       Appellant challenges the trial court’s ruling on two grounds. Appellant argues that
the release in the class action settlement agreement does not cover his claim because the
flat monthly allowance reimbursement method did not exist when the agreement was
signed. Rather, at that time, the County reimbursed employees for expenses incurred
while on assignment on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Appellant

  In his state action, Mr. Tyrer alleges that the defendants’
actions violated both the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment and the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment; the
federal action, by contrast, is more narrow, alleging only a due
process violation.
9
   Mr. Tyrer in his state action also names as defendants the City
Council members in their individual capacities. But “[t]he
existence of additional parties in one suit does not of itself
destroy parallelism.” Schneider Nat. Carriers, Inc. v. Carr, 903 F.2d
1154, 1156 (7th Cir. 1990). Significantly, the City of South Beloit
is a defendant in both the state and the federal action; that
Mr. Tyrer also named the City Council members as defendants in
his state suit does not undermine the conclusion that Mr. Tyrer’s
federal suit raises the same claims against the City that are being
litigated currently in his state action.
10
  For example, as we shall discuss further in the text below, the
same persons would be deposed in both suits—namely the
City Council members, the architects who submitted plans to
the Zoning Board of Appeals and Mr. Tyrer. The same documents
also would be evaluated in both suits, including the records of

297 F.3d 332, 341 (4th Cir. 2002) (holding that because the

dismissal or stay under Colorado River was proper (emphasis

be gained from rehashing the same evidence in another forum

desire to avoid piecemeal litigation counseled in favor of a
stay.” (emphasis added)).
  Mr. Tyrer responds that, although the state suit focuses
exclusively on events pre-demolition, the federal suit
focuses on the constitutionality of the demolition itself—“a

*107 -IV-
We now turn to Sonderman's argument that because Remington failed to record the vacation order as a deed, the order is void against Sonderman and cannot defeat his claim as a subsequent bona fide purchaser. The argument implicates two statutes. Remington points to N.J.S.A. 46:16-1.1, which provides that "[c]ertified copies of final decrees of the former Court of Chancery, final judgments of record of this State * * * may be recorded as deeds of conveyance in the office of the county recording officer of the county wherein the real estate is situate * * *." Its point is that the statute permits, but does not require, the recording of either the foreclosure judgment or the order he obtained vacating that judgment.
Sonderman, however, relies on N.J.S.A. 46:22-1, which prescribes the effect of the failure to record deeds or other instruments. The statute states in relevant part that
[e]very deed or instrument of the nature or description set forth in section 46:16-1 of this title shall, until duly recorded or lodged for record in the office of the county recording officer in which the affected real estate or other property is situate, be void and of no effect against * * * all subsequent bona fide purchasers * * * whose deed shall have been first duly recorded * * *.
Sonderman argues that the order vacating the tax foreclosure judgment, like the judgment itself, should have been recorded in the county deed book and that because it was not so recorded, the order is "void and of no effect" against him. For different reasons, both lower courts rejected that argument.
The Chancery Division ruled that "the Recording Act, per se, is not involved," implicitly ruling that the order need not have been recorded in the deed book. By comparison, the Appellate Division acknowledged the applicability of the Recording Act, stating that
[u]nder N.J.S.A. 46:22-1, deeds and instruments of the nature set forth in N.J.S.A. 46:16-1 are void against subsequent recording bona fide purchasers for value without notice, unless first duly recorded or lodged for record in the county recording office.
However, the book of deeds is not the only record source involved in a diligent search for duly recorded judgments. There is an obligation imposed upon

testimony, contained McLane’s confidential information regarding rebates and pricing. Although

McKinney may not have obtained McLane’s confidential information directly from McLane, he

nonetheless possessed McLane’s confidential information either through Circle K or through Hill,

neither of whom had permission to share that information.

               The record supports findings that McKinney, like Hill, possessed confidential

McLane information, and was planning to use that information to audit McLane for Circle K. Hill

                                                   8
and McKinney were hired by Leavitt to provide information in connection with the audit and,

according to Hill, answer questions. Both Hill and McKinney’s recovery was to be a percentage of

the revenue generated by the audit. Any McLane trade secrets or confidential information that Hill

or McKinney knew could be used in the audit or in Circle K’s other negotiations with McLane.

Under the circumstances, the district court could have found that it was probable that Hill and

McKinney would use confidential information, including trade secrets, for their benefit and to

McLane’s detriment. See Rugen, 864 S.W.2d at 552. We therefore cannot conclude that the

district court abused its discretion in finding a probable right to relief with regard to McKinney’s

misappropriation of trade secrets.

               We overrule appellants’ first issue.


Probable, imminent, irreparable injury

               In their second issue, appellants contend that the district court abused its discretion

in finding that McLane will be irreparably harmed by their participation in an audit of McLane. To

the contrary, the district court heard evidence that Hill had intimate knowledge of McLane’s

accounting practices and access to customer and pricing information. McKinney also possessed

confidential information belonging to McLane. The district court heard evidence that if Hill or

McKinney disclosed this information to any of McLane’s customers, the customers could use the

information to negotiate down prices or otherwise to renegotiate their relationships with McLane to

McLane’s detriment. It is a reasonable inference that if Hill and McKinney were to impermissibly

use McLane’s trade secrets to perform an audit, the resulting damages would be difficult to calculate.

Court of Appeals of Maryland.
Decided January 22, 1958.
The cause was argued before BRUNE, C.J., and HENDERSON, HAMMOND, PRESCOTT and HORNEY, JJ.
Sheldon E. Bernstein, with whom were Jackson Brodsky, David G. Bress and Mark B. Sandground on the brief, for the appellant.
James R. Miller, with whom were Lee C. Miller and James R. Miller, Jr., on the brief, for the appellee.
HENDERSON, J., delivered the opinion of the Court.
This appeal in a non-jury case is from a judgment for $12,412.23, in an action for breach of a written contract, dated December 2, 1954, whereby the appellee, plaintiff, agreed to construct storm sewers in Oakwood Knolls Subdivision, Bethesda, Maryland, and the appellant, defendant, to pay therefor an aggregate price of $43,000.00 The subdivision was laid out in two sections. Lots had been sold and some houses were under construction in the first section, so that construction was urgent. No lots had been sold in Section II. After completing substantially all of the work in the first section, the plaintiff declined to perform the work in the second section, on the ground that the defendant had failed to pay for the work performed and materials furnished in the first section, and had failed to obtain the necessary permits to enable it to perform the work in the second. It brought suit to recover the balance due and damages. The appellant defended on the ground that it was justified in refusing payment until all the work was fully completed, alleging that the contract was entire and indivisible, and that the *376 plaintiff committed an anticipatory breach of the contract by indicating its intention not to proceed with work in the second section at a time when there was a bona fide dispute as to payment for the work completed. The appellant also contends that the court applied the wrong measure of damages, and the proof did not support the damages allowed.
The contract is not a model of clarity. The construction work was required to be in conformity with the standards and specifications of the Montgomery County Department of Public Works and in conformity with a permit issued November 12, 1954, by the State Roads Commission.

Leonard Groves, Jr., v. Joseph Meko, Warden


        SILER, Circuit Judge, concurring and dissenting in part. I concur in the majority opinion

to the extent that it affirms the denial of the writ of habeas corpus by the district court on Counts 1-4,

6. I dissent, however, on the denial of the writ on Count 5 for the reasons stated herein. As the

majority observes, in Marshall v. Commonwealth, 625 S.W.2d 581 (Ky. 1981), the Supreme Court

of Kentucky held that a defendant’s conviction for first-degree wanton endangerment during a

robbery constituted double jeopardy when the defendant was also convicted of first-degree robbery.

Id. at 582-83. Of course, we must decide whether this is still the law after United States v. Dixon,

509 U.S. 688, 703-12 (1993). The test now for double jeopardy is not whether both charges involve

the same conduct, but whether each crime requires proof of a fact the other does not. As the majority

observes, after Dixon, Kentucky courts have held that charges for first-degree wanton endangerment

and first-degree robbery pass the test under Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299 (1932). See

Crisp v. Commonwealth, No. 2004-SC-0058-MR, 2005 WL 629005, at *2 (Ky. Mar. 17, 2005),

Grider v. Commonwealth, No. 2006-CA-001999-MR, 2008 WL 299023, at *2 (Ky. Ct. App. Feb.

1, 2008).

        While it is clear that first-degree robbery requires proof of an element that first-degree

wanton endangerment does not (i.e., theft), it is less clear whether the reverse is true. In other words,

it is unclear whether “us[ing] or threaten[ing] the . . . use of physical force upon another person”

while being “armed with a deadly weapon” (an element of first-degree robbery) constitutes

“manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life” and “wantonly engag[ing] in conduct

JOHN C. HARRISON, Justice.
This is an appeal by Bozena Vinsova and Antonin Hosa, daughter and son and next of kin of Anna Hosova, deceased, from a judgment and decree entered in the estate of Anna Hosova, deceased, by the Honorable R.J. Nelson, Judge of the District Court of the Eighth Judicial District of the State of Montana, in and for the County of Cascade.
Anna Hosova died intestate at Louny, Czechoslovakia, on June 10, 1946, leaving an estate in Cascade County, consisting of an undivided one-half interest in certain farm lands of substantial value.
On January 27, 1960, Bozena Vinsova and Antonin Hosa, residents of Czechoslovakia, by their attorney filed a petition for determination of heirship and for order declaring reciprocity to exist. In this petition it was alleged inter alia, that reciprocity of inheritance rights between the United States and Czechoslovakia existed at the time of the death of Anna Hosova and still exists as required by R.C.M. 1947, section 91-520, and prayed that their rights as heirs of the decedent be determined by the court.
The State of Montana, on March 22, 1960, filed its answer denying that such reciprocity existed on June 10, 1946, the date of death of the deceased or now exists between the United States and Czechoslovakia and prayed that "the foreign heirs be put upon their proof in establishing heirship and proving reciprocity of inheritance and reciprocity of transfer as required by law."
After due proceedings the matter came on for hearing before the court, sitting without a jury on October 25, 1960. By stipulation of counsel it was agreed that the testimony of expert witnesses and other material evidence on the issue of reciprocity of inheritance would cover not only the date of death of Anna Hosova, that is, June 10, 1946, but also four other cases pending in Montana involving heirs or beneficiaries in Czechoslovakia. The dates of death in these four cases are all later *307 than the date here. However, this appeal concerns

The operating agreement also addressed the treatment of capital accounts in the event a
member withdrew from DWP. Article 9.5 provided:

      Withdrawal. A Member may withdraw from the Company for any reason
      after ninety (90) days’ written notice to the Company and remaining
      Members. The Company shall pay to such Withdrawing Member an
      amount equal to the value of such Withdrawing Member’s Capital Account
      balance as of his date of withdrawal . . . within six (6) months of the
      determination of such amount.

        On December 31, 2010, Mr. Warner withdrew as a member of DWP with a
negative balance in his capital account in the amount of $399,657.00. Mr. Warner did
not pay DWP the negative balance in his capital account when he withdrew from the
company. In 2011, Mr. Warner received an Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) Schedule
K-1 Form issued by DWP depicting income to him in the amount of the capital account
deficit. Wayne Vanderford, the certified public accountant for DWP, prepared the 2011
Schedule K-1.

       DWP sent a letter to Mr. Warner’s attorney on February 8, 2012, demanding that
Mr. Warner pay to the company the negative balance in his capital account or dispute the
claim and provide documentation supporting his position. When Mr. Warner failed either
to pay DWP for the negative balance or dispute the claim, DWP initiated this lawsuit on
June 12, 2012, asserting claims for unjust enrichment and breach of the operating
agreement.

       Following discovery, DWP filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking a
judgment against Mr. Warner for the negative capital account balance pursuant to Article
9.5 of the operating agreement. Recognizing that Article 9.5 does not address the
obligation of a withdrawing member to reimburse DWP for a capital account deficit upon
withdrawal, DWP asserted that it was only “logical and equitable” for such an obligation
to exist because DWP had an obligation to pay a withdrawing member’s positive capital
account balance at the time of withdrawal. The trial court agreed and, on March 17,
2015, it entered an order granting DWP partial summary judgment. The trial court

(D.C. Cir. 1988); Neal v.

"Past local miscellaneous service shall be converted to local safety service if the past service:
"(a) Was rendered by a current employee of the same agency for which the miscellaneous service was performed; and
"(b) Was rendered in a position that has subsequently been reclassified as a local safety position; and
"(c) Is credited to an employee who has other local safety service credit for service performed with the agency."
[6]  Another formulation is provided in de Sloovere, Textual Interpretation of Statutes (1934) 11 N.Y.U.L.Q. Rev. 538; reprinted in 2B Sutherland Statutory Construction (5th ed. 1992) 315, 319 [Textual Interpretation]): "[T]he real problem of interpretation in most cases is ... the making of a satisfactory choice from the several possible meanings that the text will bear, the choice may well be one between literalness, logic, history, analysis, grammar, rhetoric, or a meaning derived from aids extrinsic of the text. But which ever is chosen, it must be justified by the whole text by fair use of language."
[7]  "The classical statement is in William v. Berkeley, Plow 223, 231, (1601): `Whoever would consider an act well ought always have particular regard to the intent of it, and accordingly as the intent appears, he ought to construe the words.' It simply means that as the legislative intent appears from the text or context or as light may be thrown upon them by extrinsic aids one ought to construe the words." (Textual Interpretation, supra, at pp. 328-329.)
[8]  Sacramento suggests that there is an absurdity presented because, in light of the subsequent legislation, persons hired as fire prevention, training, and investigation employees after it became effective are entitled to "local safety membership" only at the election of the local agency. This only aids a claim that the subsequent legislation is absurd. However, even as to that, reducing pension benefits for future employees presents no absurdity. (See generally, Claypool v. Wilson (1992) 4 Cal. App.4th 646, 669-670 [6 Cal. Rptr.2d 77].)

In arguing that the district court in the present case abused its discretion, defendant cites the case of United States v. Leja, 568 F.2d 493 (6th Cir. 1977).  Therein, defendant's counsel had attempted to impeach the credibility of a government informant by showing that the informant's livelihood had depended entirely upon the government's compensation.  The district court had allowed cross-examination of the informant as to his compensation from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) for his work in the Immediate case.  However, the court had refused to allow any inquiry whatever into the informant's compensation for his Previous work with the DEA.  The Sixth Circuit reversed the judgment of conviction, reasoning:


11
Past rewards are actually more important than remuneration for the case at hand, since pay for the case at hand comes after the work is done.  Evidence of past rewards shows what an informant can expect by making a case.  It is in making a case that any deceit occurs, for once the case is made, and an investigation terminated by arrest, the testimony is virtually assured.


12
568 F.2d at 498.  We find that the holding of the Sixth Circuit in Leja is sound.  However, the facts of the present appeal are distinguishable from the facts of Leja.  In the case now before us, the district court allowed defendant's counsel to elicit in detail the fact that the government informant had worked for the DEA on previous occasions.  Further, the court ordered the government to produce the DEA's pay guidelines so that defendant's counsel could use the guidelines in his cross-examination.  In Leja, on the other hand, the district court had forbidden All inquiry into the subject of the compensation, if any, that had been previously paid to the government's witness.


13
After a careful review of the record in the present case, we conclude that ". . .  the jury had sufficient information to appraise the bias and motives . . ." of the DEA's informant.  Skinner v. Cardwell, supra, 564 F.2d at 1389.


14
For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.

 Honorable John W. Peck, Senior United States Circuit Judge, Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation

 The facts of the present case are not important for the purposes of this appeal.  Suffice it to say

The Board also argues that Walker did not prove any irreparable injury that would support the issuance of an injunction. We therefore consider whether Walker's removal from the Board was an irreparable injury. In an analogous case, this Court has discussed the element of irreparable injury in the context of injunctive relief:
"Ordinarily a court of equity will not interfere with the internal affairs of a voluntary association, or assume jurisdiction to restrain its acts done or attempted *338 in accordance with its rules and within the scope of its powers. On the other hand, if the act complained of is unauthorized or unlawful and occasions irreparable injury to the complainant member for which there is no adequate and complete remedy at law, equitable relief by way of injunction will be granted. 28 Amer.Jur. section 161, page 351.
"But it is earnestly insisted that irreparable injury is not shown here.
"It is perfectly clear that the threatened acts of the respondents are unauthorized, unlawful and in direct violation of the constitution of the society. As above pointed out, this court has ruled to the effect that complainant's membership... is a property right of value; that the constitution of the society is a contract between its members, and one that the society itself must observe until changed in legal form."
Medical Soc'y of Mobile County v. Walker, 245 Ala. 135, 140, 16 So.2d 321, 325 (1944) (emphasis added). In light of the principles stated in Medical Society of Mobile County, the trial court could have properly concluded that Walker had suffered irreparable injury. Thus, we cannot reverse the trial court's order on the basis that the plaintiff had not shown an irreparable injury.

IV. The Board's Authority to Remove Walker

The Board's final argument is that it was acting within its authority when it removed Walker. We first note that the passage of time has rendered moot the issue of the Board's authority to remove Walker from the remainder of her 1999 term.
"[I]t is not within the province of this court to decide abstract or hypothetical questions, which are disconnected from the gravity of actual relief, or from the determination of which no practical result can follow."

record is completely silent on why the court denied Roberson’s petition. The judgment

denying Roberson’s petition contains no factual findings, and Roberson’s appellant’s

appendix on appeal includes neither a copy of the trial court’s tentative decision, which

the trial court adopted as its order denying the petition, or a transcript of the April 2,

2009, court trial on Roberson’s petition.

       But the administrative record before the trial court did show, and the court was

presumably well aware, that the attorneys for Rialto Citizens vigorously challenged the

project approvals on behalf of Rialto Citizens at the July 1 city council hearing. The

record before the trial court and on this appeal shows the attorneys for Rialto Citizens

presented a letter to the city council, which explained in a detailed attachment why the

project approvals violated CEQA, the Planning and Zoning Law, the Subdivision Map

Act (§ 66410 et seq.), and other laws. The attorneys also submitted an “opposition DVD”

for the city council’s consideration.

       Again, the record on appeal does not indicate that Roberson ever explained to the

trial court what written comments or testimony he would have submitted at the July 1 and

15 city council hearings had he known of the planning commission’s recommendation to

adopt the project approvals. Nor does the record on appeal indicate that Roberson would

have submitted any evidence in opposition to the project approvals other than or in

addition to the evidence his attorneys submitted on behalf of Rialto Citizens.

       Thus, on this record, Roberson did not demonstrate to the trial court that the defect

in the notice of the July 1 city council hearing was prejudicial, resulted in substantial



                                              11
injury to Roberson, or that a different result was probable absent the defect in the notice.

(§ 65010, subd. (b).) To the contrary, ample evidence supports the trial court’s implied

finding—implied in the judgment denying the petition—that the defect in the notice was

not prejudicial, did not result in substantial injury to Roberson, and that a different result

was not probable if the defect had not occurred. (Ibid.) Even though this court’s July

2012 decision in Rialto Citizens was

Raj Kumar Sandhi appeals from the Board of Immigration Appeals' ("BIA") denial of his application for asylum and withholding of deportation.  He disputes the BIA's determination that his testimony was not credible, that his interrogation by the police was a legitimate prosecutorial act and that, in any event, he was ineligible for asylum because he failed to show a nationwide threat of persecution.  Because Sandhi cannot overcome the adverse credibility findings by the BIA, we affirm.

I.  FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

3
Raj Kumar Sandhi, a Sikh native and citizen of the Punjab, India, entered this country in August, 1991.  On August 28, 1991, the Immigration and Naturalization Service ("INS") issued him with an Order to Show Cause, charging him with being deportable pursuant to 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1251a(1)(B) for entering the United States without inspection.  Sandhi admitted deportability, but applied for asylum and withholding of deportation.  At his hearing, Sandhi told the following story of political persecution.


4
Sandhi testified that his troubles began in September, 1990, when Sikh militants, who advocate the use of violence to create an independent Sikh state (Khalistan), came to his home to recruit him.  He said he refused to join, and told them that, while he supported the creation of Khalistan, he did not believe the Sikh religion permitted the use of violent methods to achieve these ends.  He said the militants warned him they would kill him if he should become involved in the government.


5
Sandhi said the militants repeated their demands a month later, again to no avail.  He said that the militants threatened to kill him, but gave him another chance.  According to Sandhi, his third and final encounter with the militants took place in February of 1991, when he again refused to join them, but again was given another chance to reconsider.


6
Sandhi told the IJ he was afraid the militants would carry out their threats.  He testified that he knew of others who had been killed by Sikh militants after refusing to join them.


7
Sandhi also told the IJ about his troubles with the police, who came to his home in March, 1991, and told him they suspected him of involvement with the Sikh militants.  Sandhi testified that he was taken

COWEN, Circuit Judge.

       This case is before the Court on an application of the National Labor Relations

Board (the “Board”) to enforce an order entered on August 23, 2010 against Regency

Grande Nursing and Rehabilitation Center (“Regency Grande”). For the reasons that

follow, we will enforce the order.

                                      I.

       In 2005, the Board found that Regency Grande had engaged in unfair labor

practices at its Dover, New Jersey facility during organizing efforts by Local 300S, a

union affiliated with the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, and Local 1199

of the Service Employees International Union (“SEIU”). Specifically, the Board found

that Regency Grande had violated Sections 8(a)(1), (2), and (3) of the National Labor

Relations Act (the “Act”) by recognizing Local 300S as the exclusive collective-

bargaining representative of employees and entering into a collective-bargaining

agreement with Local 300S at a time when that union did not represent a majority of

those employees. Regency Grande Nursing & Rehab. Ctr., 347 NLRB 1143 (2006).

Upon review, this Court found that substantial evidence supported the Board’s findings

and enforced the Board’s order. N.L.R.B. v. Regency Grand Nursing & Rehab. Ctr., 265

F. App’x 74 (

FACTS
In 1986, Congress expanded Medicaid coverage of pregnancy-related medical care to low-income women who did not otherwise qualify for Medicaid. Women during pregnancy and the 60-day postpartum period who are not eligible under any other Medicaid program and whose income is up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level or, at the State's option, up to 185 percent of the federal poverty level, can apply for limited prenatal and postpartum health care services. 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(l)(1) & (2); 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV). New York State has exercised the option to provide for coverage up to 185 percent of the federal poverty level.
Medical coverage in this program is different from that offered by conventional Medicaid, in that it is limited to prenatal, delivery, postpartum care, and family-planning services. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10). There is no coverage for other kinds of medical care not related to pregnancy or childbirth. However, households which continue to meet the eligibility standards under the Act after the baby's birth may obtain continued health care under Medicaid's Infant Care Program until the infant is one year old. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(l)(1)(B).
For conventional Medicaid coverage, eligible applicants must cooperate with the State Medicaid agency to obtain financial support from third parties who may be legally responsible to support them. Until 1990, applicants could be exempted from this requirement only "[if] the individual is found to have good cause for refusing to cooperate...." 42 U.S.C. § 1396k(a)(1)(B) (1986). However, in 1990, Congress amended § 1396k to add another exemption to the "good-cause" exception. Recognizing that the cooperation requirement created a barrier for some pregnant women who seek prenatal care, Congress decided to exempt women who receive *487 only the limited pregnancy-related medical care coverage, as described in § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV). 42 U.S.C. § 1396k(a)(1)(B) (1990).[1]
In October 1991, Jodi Perry applied for Medicaid benefits to cover the costs of her pregnancy-related medical care. She was told she was ineligible for comprehensive Medicaid coverage because of her income level, but could receive pregnancy-related benefits for the duration of her pregnancy, including 60 days postpartum

 The principles that control in our case are set forth in Unger v. Campau (1956) 142 Cal.App.2d 722 [298 P.2d 891], wherein the defendants sold the plaintiff a dwelling which they had listed as having three separate rental units and *6 which they had told the plaintiff could easily be used for income purposes. In actuality, one of the rental units had been constructed in an illegal manner and without inspection permits, and could not be legally rented. The court upheld the trial court's finding that the manner in which the property had been listed and the defendants' statement that it could easily be rented constituted misrepresentations upon which the plaintiff was justified in relying. As to the question of whether the defendants knew that they were required to obtain permits, the court noted that there was evidence that one of the defendants had worked as a hod carrier, bricklayer and plasterer, and that he had previously obtained a permit in connection with other work performed by him. He had also testified that he knew a permit was necessary for work costing $200 or more. The court thus concluded that the question of knowledge was one of fact and that there was ample evidence to support the trial court's finding of actual knowledge.
 In the case at bar, the representations made by the Cirias and their agent, Mr. Vagin, were almost identical to those made in the Unger case. Granting there was evidence on both sides of the matter, the conflict in the evidence was for the trier of facts. Hence, it cannot be said as a matter of law that the lower court erred in finding that the Cirias knew of the need for permits.
 [3] Appellants next contend that the trial court was without power to hold Paul T. Ciria and Virginia Shank liable as constructive trustees of the note and deed of trust in the absence of any showing that these defendants participated in or had knowledge of the fraud of their parents. Appellants further contend that respondents' failure to file a claim in the estate of Rachel Ciria precluded them from offsetting their damages against the interests of Paul T. Ciria and Virginia Shank. Neither of these arguments is meritorious.
 While the trial court correctly found that Paul T. Ciria and Virginia Shank "did not have any part in any transaction leading up to the sale of said real property to plaintiffs," it does not follow, however, that the court erred in holding these defendants liable as constructive trustees of their interests in the note and deed of trust

                Although the Board of Adjustment application contained a description of the property,

stated that JV Road, L.P. was “seller[] to” SDN, Ltd., and was signed by Mike Young, the agreement

was not an agreement between the parties and was not made for the purpose of memorializing

an agreement to sell the real property at issue. It was an application in which Young represented

himself as the seller—or potential seller—and in which he authorized Lopez-Phelps to act as his

agent, but did not show that a sale had been made or that a contract had been signed. Moreover, the

application contained none of the material terms, including the price for which the property would

be sold. The application represented Young’s attempt to secure rezoning with the City, which was

a prerequisite to a sale between Young and DeNucci. The application was not an agreement to make

a sale of real property.

                DeNucci also relies on a series of email correspondence between the parties that,

he alleges, demonstrates in writing that he and Young had agreed to all material terms. Specifically,

he refers to a July 7, 2006 email in which he sets out the status of his negotiations with Henges

and his thoughts about incorporating the Henges tract. He continues by proposing to proceed with

the project without the Henges tract. DeNucci then writes: “There are some issues we would need

to make sure we all agree on.” He then sets out a list of five items yet to be agreed upon, including

the number of parking spaces available for Chuy’s, the price, the timing, the possibility of a



                                                  7
temporary parking lot, and other miscellaneous issues, including an issue with an easement and

sewer service. On the same day, in response to this email, Young wrote:


       We jointly developed the property with Joe’s and have a reciprocal parking
       agreement that, I believe, will allow us to use it as we see fit. We will need to have
       Ann look at the joint use agreement (Hatcher will you get this from Sharon and to
       Ann v?). As for the other stuff...it makes more sense to get henges on the plate... I
       believe it is good for you to talk to his at

In particular, he opined that the subject property experienced 60-mph winds

because Miami-Opa Locka Airport, which is located more than three miles from

the subject property, recorded wind “gusts” of 60 miles per hour of unknown

duration on June 29, 2013. Significantly, the claimed date of loss was two weeks

later on or about July 17, 2013. Moreover, Mr. Brizuela admitted “Predicting wind

at other locations, wind speed from a particular direction at a particular time, with

an acceptable degree of accuracy is currently highly inaccurate.”

      This Court reviews a trial court’s ruling on a motion for summary judgment

de novo. Volusia Cty. v. Aberdeen at Ormond Beach, L.P., 760 So. 2d 126, 130

(Fla. 2000). “Summary judgment is proper if there is no genuine issue of material

fact and if the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” Id.

“Summary judgment is designed to test the sufficiency of the evidence to

determine if there is sufficient evidence at issue to justify a trial or formal hearing

on the issues raised in the pleadings.” The Fla. Bar v. Greene, 926 So. 2d 1195,

1200 (Fla. 2006). Because summary judgment tests the sufficiency of the evidence

most favorable to the non-moving party, and assuming the jury would resolve all

such factual disputes and inferences favorably to the non-moving party, the non-

Gerelco Traffic Controls, Inc., 176 So. 3d 329, 334–35 (Fla. 3d DCA 2015).

      A court considering summary judgment must avoid two extremes. On the

one hand, “a motion for summary judgment is not a trial by affidavit or deposition.

Summary judgment is not intended to weigh and resolve genuine issues of material

judgment in favor of defendant, after trial to the court, on claims of negligence

brought pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act. He also requests appellate

Further, even if they had been, threats to make an allegation of a crime do not

bodily injury which creates a substantial risk of death, causes serious permanent
                                            10


         A.P. has asked this court to interpret section 702.18 and expand the

definition of “threat or menace of serious bodily injury” to include injuries to a

person’s     reputation    and   criminal    background      and     the   accompanying

consequences. However, we are bound by the plain meaning of the words and

legislature’s intent.     See McGill v. Fish, 790 N.W.2d 113, 118 (Iowa 2010)

(holding “we do not search for legislative intent beyond the express language of a

statute when that language is plain and the meaning is clear”). “[W]ords used in

a statute have their ordinary and commonly understood meaning,” and we are

not at liberty to interpret them otherwise. See id. at 119. Thus, we must decline

A.P.’s request to expand section 702.18.

         We do not find the trial court abused its discretion, and we affirm on this

issue.

         A.P. avers the facts do not support a finding he committed third-degree

sexual abuse.      Under Iowa Code section 709.4(2)(b), for third-degree sexual

abuse the State needs to prove beyond a reasonable doubt A.P. performed a sex

act with a person, not his spouse, who was either twelve or thirteen years of age

at the time of the incident. A.P. maintains the State did not produce sufficient

evidence and argues the juvenile court erred when it adjudicated him.

         A.P.’s argument rests upon the fact A.P. was either thirteen or fourteen

years old at the time of the incident whereas the complaining witness was twelve.

PER CURIAM:*

     Tony L. Bland, Mississippi prisoner # 24431, has filed an

application for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on

appeal, following the district court’s dismissal as frivolous of

his civil rights complaint.    By moving for IFP, Bland is

challenging the district court’s certification that IFP status

should not be granted on appeal because his appeal is not taken

in good faith.   See Baugh v. Taylor, 117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir. 1997).

     The district court construed Bland’s complaint as raising a

challenge to the medical care he received in the Mississippi

Department of Corrections and ordered that the case be dismissed

on res judicata and collateral estoppel grounds, as Bland had

raised the same claims in the state courts.   Bland contends that

he was actually attempting to appeal the Mississippi Supreme

Court’s failure to grant him IFP status on his appeal in the

state courts and the subsequent dismissal of his appeal.     Under

the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, federal district courts lack

jurisdiction to review state judgments.   United States v.

      Bagley pleaded guilty to one count of possessing a forged and counterfeit
security in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 513(a). The security at issue was a blank
counterfeit check. It was one of many that Bagley and others had created using
stolen identities.
      Although the count to which she was pleading guilty involved a blank
check and thus caused no loss, the factual resume Bagley signed at the plea
colloquy stated that the penalty for her conviction may include “restitution to
victims . . . which the defendant agrees may include restitution arising from
all relevant conduct, not limited to that arising from the offense of conviction
alone.” The district court also orally confirmed this understanding before
Bagley entered her plea.
      The Presentence Report (PSR) noted that restitution is ordinarily limited
to the offense of conviction, but characterized Bagley’s acknowledgement in the
factual resume as an agreement that she would “pay restitution as a result of
all relevant conduct.” The relevant conduct assessment, which was also used
to determine Bagley’s Sentencing Guidelines range, found $7,918.57 in actual
loss attributable to counterfeit checks that were used during the scheme.
Bagley did not object to either this calculation or the PSR’s recommendation
that restitution should include relevant conduct. The district court followed
the PSR and ordered Bagley to pay restitution of $7,918.57.


                                      II.
      Because Bagley challenges the restitution order for the first time in this
appeal, we review for plain error. To demonstrate plain error, an appellant
must show an error that is clear and obvious and that affected her substantial
rights. Puckett v. United States, 556 U.S. 129, 135 (2009) (citing United States
v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732–34 (1993)). If the appellant makes such a showing,

OPINION
GRANT, Chief Judge.
This appeal raises a question of first impression: whether a liquidated damage provision in a contract is enforceable only upon a showing of actual damages. The appeal is taken from a partial summary judgment on the liquidated damage issue, an arbitration award and an award of attorney's fees.
FACTS
Totem Construction Company (Totem) was the general contractor on some remodeling and construction at Glendale Community *192 College. Mechanical Air Engineering Company (MAECO) was a subcontractor, furnishing labor and materials for heating, ventilating, air conditioning, sheet metal, and plumbing work. The parties agreed in paragraph 19 of their contract to damages in the amount of $350 for each day of MAECO's delay:
The SUBCONTRACTOR will cooperate with the CONTRACTOR and other SUBCONTRACTORS whose work might interface with the SUBCONTRACTOR'S work and will participate in the coordination of such interface as required, specifically, noting and advising the CONTRACTOR of any interference. The CONTRACTOR, however, will not be liable to the SUBCONTRACTOR for any delays in scheduling the work to be performed by the SUBCONTRACTOR, or any damages arising from such delays. SUBCONTRACTOR and CONTRACTOR agree that if the SUBCONTRACTOR fails to perform within the time specified on the progress schedule posted at the project site, that damages will occur to the CONTRACTOR but that such damages while capable of calculation are not capable of being specifically known at this time. Therefore in lieu of proof of such damages SUBCONTRACTOR and CONTRACTOR agree that a reasonable sum for such damages (and not as a penalty) is the sum of $350.00 per calendar days in excess of the time specifically and that such shall constitute liquidated damages agreed to.
MAECO sued Totem alleging that $16,000 was owed on its subcontracts and change orders. Totem counterclaimed, alleging that

ANALYSIS
Having granted judgment on the pleadings, the sole issue before us is the appropriate discipline. Neb. Ct. R. of Discipline 4 (rev.2004) provides that the following may be considered by this court as sanctions for attorney misconduct: (1) disbarment; (2) suspension for a fixed period of time; (3) probation in lieu of suspension, on such terms as the court may designate; (4) censure and reprimand; or (5) temporary suspension.
Regarding the imposition of attorney discipline, each case must be evaluated individually in the light of the particular facts and circumstances of that case. See State ex rel. Counsel for Dis. v. Lechner, 266 Neb. 948, 670 N.W.2d 457 (2003). For purposes of determining the proper discipline of an attorney, we consider the attorney's acts both underlying the events of the case and throughout the proceeding. Id.
To determine whether and to what extent discipline should be imposed in a lawyer discipline proceeding, we consider the following factors: (1) the nature of the offense, (2) the need for deterring others, (3) the maintenance of the reputation of the bar as a whole, (4) the protection of the public, (5) the attitude of the offender generally, and (6) the offender's present or future fitness to continue in the practice of law. Id. In addition, the determination of an appropriate penalty to be imposed on an attorney in a disciplinary proceeding requires consideration of any mitigating factors. Id.
Here, Watts violated several disciplinary rules and violated his oath of office as an attorney. He has failed to respond to the charges, and there is no record of mitigating factors. We have previously disbarred attorneys who, like Watts, violated disciplinary rules regarding trust accounts, mishandled client funds, and failed to cooperate with the Counsel during the disciplinary proceedings. See, State ex rel. Counsel for Dis. v. Lechner, supra; State ex rel. Special Counsel for Dis. v. Brinker, 264 Neb. 478, 648 N.W.2d 302 (2002); State ex rel. NSBA v. Howze, 260 Neb. 547, 618 N.W.2d 663 (2000).
We have considered the undisputed allegations of the formal charges and the applicable law. Upon consideration, we find that Watts should be disbarred from the practice of law in the State of Nebraska.

Cir. 1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). Oliver cannot meet this high standard because there

is evidence that he was part of the cocaine-trafficking conspiracy.

       Oliver admits having been a cocaine dealer. The only question is whether he was part of the

conspiracy, as the jury found, or whether he was a “lone wolf” as he claims. There is evidence of

the former. Oliver purchased cocaine for resale from conspiracy members Otis Morris and Tyree

Miller. He used other conspiracy members to facilitate purchases. There was also evidence that

Oliver was involved in hundreds of drug sales. Since he did not manufacture his own cocaine, he

must have made large and frequent purchases from distributors such as Morris and Tyree Miller.

This is further evidence that Oliver was part of the conspiracy. “Since the jury was presented with

significant evidence that defendant was heavily involved in drug trafficking, it could infer that the

source of his drugs remained fairly constant.” United States v. Anderson, 89 F.3d 1306, 1311-12

(6th Cir. 1996).

       Oliver argues that evidence that he sold drugs is not enough to prove that he was part of a

conspiracy. However, such evidence may be enough to demonstrate that there was not a manifest

miscarriage of justice in this case. Furthermore, while one-off purchases do not demonstrate the

existence of a conspiracy, repeated purchases do. Id. Oliver purchased drugs from several members

of the conspiracy on multiple occasions, and used other members to set up his purchases. This

evidence supports a conclusion that he knew that the conspiracy existed and that he was distributing

drugs in furtherance of the conspiracy.

       Oliver’s sentence is reasonable considering the large amount of cocaine the conspiracy

distributed and his lengthy criminal history. Because his sentence is within the properly calculated

sentencing guideline range, it is presumed reasonable. See United States v. Rosenbaum, 585 F.3d

259, 267 (6th Cir. 2009). This reasonableness is confirmed by the factors the district court properly

used to decide on the sentence.

FARMER, J.
We affirm the revocation of probation, and in so doing uphold the trial court's determination that the search by police was not improper.
The probation order here provided for warrantless searches of the probationer's residence without probable cause. Police received information from a confidential informant that the probationer was in possession of illegal drugs and a firearm. Because they had a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, they communicated with his probation officer, who agreed to set up a search of his residence with the participation of the police. They were conducting surveillance at his residence *579 immediately before the search. When the probation officer and investigating police arrived at his residence, he was already outside speaking to other police officers involved in the surveillance.
The officers on surveillance had seen him back his vehicle out of his driveway and park it on the street. As he walked back toward his house, the surveillance team saw the van begin rolling backwards until it rolled into an auto parked behind it. The surveillance team thereupon approached and began talking to him. The probation officer and investigating officer arrived on the scene just in time to observe these events. The police officer investigating the matter then informed defendant that they were there to conduct a search of his residence. Which they then did and found enough drugs to charge and convict for trafficking and a firearm to charge and convict for possession by a convicted felon.
Defendant's argument to the trial court and here is that all of this was a pretense for police officers to do an improper search of his residence without probable cause. But in Soca v. State, 673 So.2d 24 (Fla. 1996), the Florida Supreme Court held that the evidence obtained in a warrantless search of a probationer's residence by a probation supervisor, although tipped-off and accompanied by a police investigator, was admissible in a probation revocation hearing, even though it would not be admissible in the criminal case unless that search met all the usual constitutional search and seizure requirements. 673 So.2d at 25.

The district court, entertaining a petition for review, affirmed the referee's order.

The referee made findings of fact left undisturbed by the trial court on its review.  These are amply supported by the record and are not clearly erroneous.  They fully support the conclusions reached by the referee and sustained by the district court.  In Re Rafdo Enterprises, Inc., 7 Cir., 297 F.2d 505, 507 (1962).

It is clear to us, as it was to the referee and the district court, that respondent Bank of Lincolnwood is a bona fide mortgagee and that it disbursed its loan in reliance upon the record title in good faith and upon the written direction of and for the sole benefit of petitioners.


18
It is apparent that by the guaranty, the disbursement certificate, the direction to Lawndale Bank to execute the trust deed, all signed by petitioners, and by accepting the benefits of the loan and making payments thereon, petitioners ratified the entire transaction under scrutiny and are estopped to deny the validity of the trust deed.  See Hilton v. Meier, 257 Ill. 500, 100 N.E. 962 (1913); Loughran v. Gorman, 256 Ill. 46, 99 N.E. 886 (1912).

       Memorandum Opinion by Justice Carter
                                  MEMORANDUM OPINION

       Deidra M. McGraw appeals from her conviction for possession of marihuana in the amount

of 2,000 pounds or less but more than fifty pounds, and resulting sentence of eighteen years‘

imprisonment. Her sole point of error contends that the trial court erred in denying her motion to

suppress the evidence. We affirm the trial court‘s judgment.

I.     Standard of Review

       We review a trial court‘s decision on a motion to suppress evidence by applying a

bifurcated standard of review. Graves v. State, 307 S.W.3d 483, 489 (Tex. App.—Texarkana

2010, pet. ref‘d); Rogers v. State, 291 S.W.3d 148, 151 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2009, pet. ref‘d).

While we defer to the trial court on its determination of historical facts and credibility, we review

de novo its application of the law and determination on questions not turning on credibility.

Carmouche v. State, 10 S.W.3d 323, 332 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000); Guzman v. State, 955 S.W.2d

85, 89 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997); Villarreal v. State, 935 S.W.2d 134, 138 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996);

Graves, 307 S.W.3d at 489.

       We also afford deference to a trial court‘s ―application of law to fact questions,‖ also

known as ―mixed questions of law and fact,‖ if the resolution of those questions turns on an

evaluation of credibility and demeanor. Guzman, 985 S.W.2d at 89. Since all the evidence is

viewed in the light most favorable to the trial court‘s ruling, we are obligated to uphold the denial

of McGraw‘s motion to suppress if it was supported by the record and

his assertions to the contrary, Searcy’s motion fails to properly assert any claims establishing that
his sentence was ‘improper on its face,’ as Rule 35(a) clearly requires.” The issues raised by
Searcy are actually about his underlying conviction and the lawfulness of his conviction has been
raised and affirmed on prior appeals. Therefore, any current arguments related to his underlying
conviction, whether previously raised or not, are properly barred pursuant to res judicata. For
example, Searcy asserts his first degree murder conviction was obtained through an
unconstitutional presumption contained in the jury instructions.         He also alleges the jury
determined the murder occurred in the course of the robbery, and therefore his consecutive
sentences for murder and robbery are illegal. These are challenges to his conviction, not an
attempt to correct a sentence that is illegal on its face. As noted above, Rule 35 inquiries may
not include significant factual determinations. Wolfe, 158 Idaho at 65, 343 P.3d at 507. Because
the resolution of these issues would require factual inquiries, they are not properly brought
pursuant to a Rule 35 motion. Likewise, Searcy’s argument that his determinate life sentence is
illegal because the district court failed to find certain aggravating factors before imposing the
sentence would also require factual inquiries and, thus, is not properly brought on a Rule 35
motion. Finally, Searcy asserted the sentence enhancement for use of a firearm was improperly
corrected in his absence.      Because this argument addresses the procedural aspects of his
sentencing and not the imposition of an illegal sentence, it is also not properly brought pursuant
to a Rule 35 motion and was required to be made on direct appeal. Therefore, a Rule 35 motion
is not the correct mechanism to bring such claims and the district court and this Court lack
jurisdiction to consider the issues.
       Searcy also asserts the district court erred when denying his motion for court-appointed
counsel. If a post-conviction petitioner is unable to pay for the expenses of representation, the
trial court may appoint counsel to represent the petitioner in preparing the petition in the trial
court and on appeal. I.C. § 19-4904. The decision to grant or deny a request for court-appointed
counsel lies within the discretion of the district court. Grant v. State, 156 Idaho 598, 603, 329

IN ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA.
Mr. Jerome Carty [Mr. B. Frank Clapp and Mr. Mayer Sulzberger were with him] for plaintiff in error.
*475 Mr. Richard C. Dale [Mr. Samuel Dickson was with him] for defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the court.
The plaintiff in error, who was plaintiff below, took passage at Camden, New Jersey, for Philadelphia, on a ferry-boat belonging to the defendant, a New Jersey corporation engaged in the business of transporting passengers, animals, and vehicles across the Delaware between those cities. On that trip the boat was unusually crowded with passengers. The river at the time was very full of ice, and it was difficult for the boat to get across and enter the ferry slip on the Philadelphia side. The wharf on that side was reached only after repeated efforts. In the attempt to land the boat was driven against the bridge with such force as to throw the plaintiff and a number of other persons (all of whom were standing during the passage across the river) with great violence upon the floor. The fall caused serious and, perhaps, permanent injury to the plaintiff. In this action she claims damages from the defendant upon the ground that her injuries resulted from the careless and negligent management of the ferry-boat by its agents and servants. The plaintiff made a case entitling her to go to the jury upon the issue as to the defendant's negligence. But there was, also, proof tending to show that the striking of the boat against the wharf on the Philadelphia side occurred under peculiar circumstances, and could not, perhaps, have been avoided by any diligence upon the part of the agents of the defendant.
When the evidence was concluded, and after the parties submitted their requests for instructions, the court delivered its charge upon the whole case, reading to the jury the instructions asked by either party that were approved, and accompanying them with such observations, by way of explanation or qualification, as it deemed necessary.
The third and fourth points submitted in behalf of plaintiff were overruled. They were as follows:
"Third. If the jury believe from the evidence that the defendants received the plaintiff as a passenger, and that they failed to provide her with a seat, or that she was unable to *

The dispositive issue of claim construction is whether the term "integral therewith" requires that the product be made by co-extrusion,2 the method of manufacture described in the specification. The accused shielding gasket is conceded by Parker Hannifin to contain inner and outer elastomeric layers of the same properties as described and claimed in the '854 patent, but the method of manufacture differs in that for the Parker Hannifin gasket the outer layer is applied to the inner layer by dip-coating.


5
The district court ruled, on review of the '854 specification, the prosecution history, and a dictionary definition of "integral," that the claimed gasket shield is not limited to manufacture by co-extrusion. The court instructed the jury as follows:


6
"Integral" is used here in its ordinary sense to mean formed as a unit with another part, and therefore, "integral therewith" means that the outer layer of the gasket is formed as a unit and in direct contact with the inner layer of the gasket.


7
Parker Hannifin argues that "integral therewith" requires the use of co-extrusion to manufacture the gasket, the only process shown in the specification, and that a claim not so limited would read on the prior art and would violate the written description requirement of 35 U.S.C. §112 &1. Parker Hannifin states that the district court improperly resorted to a dictionary definition of "integral" to broaden the meaning of this term from the context in which it was used. Parker Hannifin also states that the dictionary was improper extrinsic evidence.


8
A dictionary is not prohibited extrinsic evidence, and is an available resource of claim construction. Although a dictionary definition may not enlarge the scope of a term when the specification and the prosecution history show that the inventor, or recognized usage in the field of the invention, have given the term a limited or specialized meaning, a dictionary is often useful to aid the court in determining the correct meaning to be ascribed to a term as it was used. See Hockerson-Halberstadt, Inc. v. Avia Group Int'l, Inc., 222 F.3d 951, 955, 55 USPQ2d 1487, 1490 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Multiform Dessicants Inc. v. Medzam, Ltd., 133 F.3d 1473, 1478, 45

I. Background

Assessment Statistics Request
"Assessments" allow agents to use authorized investigative techniques to gather information and intelligence on individuals, groups, and organizations that may be involved in activities that are criminal or threaten national security. (Declaration of David M. Hardy dated March 25, 2011 ("Hardy Decl.") ¶ 3 n. 2.) The information gathered in these assessments help the FBI determine whether further investigation is necessary. Id. "Assessments may be used when the FBI obtains `an allegation or information' or an `articulable factual basis' concerning crimes or threats to national security, and the matter can be investigated or resolved through the relatively non-intrusive methods authorized in assessments." (Id.)
Following Mr. Savage's November 4, 2009 Assessment Request, the FBI sent a letter to the NYT on December 11, 2009 acknowledging receipt of the Assessment Request and stating it was currently reviewing its files. (Hardy Decl. ¶ 23.) On *429 December 23, 2009, the FBI denied the Assessment Request citing exemptions contained in 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5) ("Exemption 5") because the information was still in draft form. (McGraw Decl., Ex. H.) Exemption 5 exempts the disclosure of all "inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency." 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5). On December 30, 2009, the NYT filed an administrative appeal from the denial with the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Information on Policy ("OIP"). (Id., Ex. I.) On July 8, 2010, OIP upheld the FBI's denial of the FOIA request. (Id., Ex. J.) By letter to Mr. Savage and the NYT dated December 1, 2010, the FBI advised that Exemption 5, pertaining to draft pages, was no longer applicable and released the requested copy of the letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee but redacted the assessment statistics. (Id., Ex. K.) The FBI asserted that the redactions were exempt from disclosure pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(2) ("Exemption 2") applying to internal personnel rules and practices of an agency,[2] and § 552(b)(7)(E) ("Exemption 7(E)") pertaining to law enforcement.[3] (Id.)

       Parents of M.Y., a 15-year-old disabled girl, sued District for damages arising
from a sexual assault allegedly perpetrated against M.Y. by her bus driver, Isse, while
being transported home from summer school at W. Harry Davis Academy. In their
Complaint, Parents assert eleven different claims arising under the common law, the
United States Constitution, and various other federal and state statutes. The district
court granted summary judgment in favor of District on all of Parents’ claims.

        M.Y. is a student with a disability under the Individuals with Disabilities Act
Education Act (“IDEA”), 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et. seq. (2000), section 504, and related
state law. As a result of her disabilities, M.Y. qualified for and had been attending the

We will herein refer to the parties, plaintiffs or defendant, as they were aligned in the trial court, or by name.
Plaintiffs' complaint alleged that they purchased from Floyd E. Harris on August 30, 1937 a portion of the southeast quarter of the southeast quarter of Section 35, Twp. 8 N., R. 69 West of the 6th p. m. in Larimer County, Colorado; that at the time of purchase "there was an established and used access right-of-way of State Highway 287 along and just south of the north line of said described land." That on February 17, 1938 plaintiffs sold to Arthur Collamer and Frank E. Collamer a portion of said above described land by warranty deed which deed recited "subject, however, to the rights-of-way for roads and ditches as now constructed; it being the intention hereof to exclude the county road from this conveyance." It is then alleged that defendant had refused to allow plaintiffs access to the lands owned by them. Powers acquired title to his land from one Stern, who acquired title through Collamer. Plaintiffs' deed contained the identical "subject" clause above quoted.
Plaintiffs prayed that the court adjudge that they owned a right-of-way over and through said tract of land and that defendant be enjoined from denying plaintiffs access to their property across defendant's land.
By answer defendant denied that any such access road ever existed. By way of cross-complaint defendant prayed for a decree quieting title in defendant as against "any claimed right-of-way through defendant's property." The allegations of the cross-complaint were put in issue by plaintiffs and the case proceeded to trial resulting in findings and judgment in favor of defendant and that "plaintiffs have no right-of-way over and across" the property first above described. From this judgment plaintiffs bring the case here on writ of error.

PER CURIAM.


      Glenn R. Waite, brought an action seeking damages under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983
and 1985(3) against two Nebraska judges and a Nebraska court clerk. Waite claimed
the defendants individually, and in conspiracy, denied him access to the courts and
equal protection by refusing to file his pleading seeking to reopen an appeal in which
the mandate had issued nearly three years earlier, and by concealing the judicial
determination that such post-mandate pleadings would not be filed. Waite also sought
declaratory relief. The district court1 granted summary judgment to defendants based
on absolute judicial and quasi-judicial immunity, and denied declaratory relief. Waite
appeals.

       We conclude summary judgment was proper. The evidence showed the
defendant judges acted within their judicial capacity and jurisdiction regarding the post-
mandate document and notification to Waite of the procedure being followed. See
Mireles v. Waco, 502 U.S. 9, 11-12 (1991) (per curiam) (discussing parameters of
judicial immunity). The evidence also established the defendant clerk acted at the
judges& direction. See Rogers v. Bruntrager, 841 F.2d 853, 856 (8th Cir. 1988) (clerks
absolutely immune from actions for damages arising from acts that “they are
specifically required to do under court order or at judge&s direction”). Furthermore, any
conspiracy claim against defendants cannot overcome the bar of absolute immunity

argues   that   the   district   court    clearly   erred   (1)   in   its

determination of drug quantity for purposes of relevant conduct;

(2) in denying a downward adjustment in his offense level for

acceptance of responsibility; and (3) by assigning one criminal

history point to his conviction for driving without insurance. Upon

review of the records, briefings, and applicable case law, we

conclude that the district court committed no reversible error.

     Hacker failed to produce evidence sufficient to rebut both the

PSR's estimate of drug quantity and the testimony of the case

agent, upon which the PSR estimate was based. Hacker's conclusory

assertion that he made only 15 deliveries of marijuana, averaging

only 40 pounds per delivery, is insufficient to establish clear

error.1

     In addition, Hacker tested positive for marijuana use on two

separate    occasions   while   on   pretrial    release.    Even   if   these

positive tests were based on Hacker's addiction to marijuana, they

support the district court's decision to deny him the acceptance-

of-responsibility adjustment.2

     Finally, because the misdemeanor conviction resulted in a 60-

day sentence     of   imprisonment   and   one   year   of   probation,    the

district court did not err in applying it to a determination of

Hacker's criminal history score. Indeed, Hacker's conviction for

driving without insurance is "similar" to "[d]riving without a

MR. JUSTICE UNDERWOOD delivered the opinion of the court:
Plaintiff, an auto insurer, filed this subrogation action in the circuit court of Cook County, seeking to recover from defendants certain payments plaintiff made to its insured under the property damage and medical payments provisions of the insured's auto policy. Defendants moved to dismiss, raising as a bar a general release running from the insured to defendants. The circuit court dismissed the complaint and the appellate court affirmed (49 Ill. App.3d 569), citing an "unbroken line of Illinois appellate *211 court cases which support the circuit court's ruling that plaintiff's claim is barred by the insured's release to the defendants" (49 Ill. App.3d 569, 571). We granted leave to appeal and now reverse.
Plaintiff-insurer alleged that on August 2, 1974, defendant Gary L. Gardner, an employee of defendant Ingram Barge, Inc., negligently drove an automobile owned by defendant Hertz Corporation so as to injure plaintiff's insured and damage his auto. Plaintiff also alleged that it paid its insured's property damage and medical payments policy claims in the amount of $2,082.36 and that it thereby became subrogated to the interests of the insured to the extent of those payments. Ingram submitted in support of its motion to dismiss a full and final release of all personal injury and property damage claims arising from the accident, which release was executed by the insured in consideration of the payment to him of $6,000. It is not disputed that this release had been executed by the insured in connection with the settlement of his separate suit against the defendants here for personal injury damages and the $100 property damage paid by him under his deductible clause, and that no recovery had been sought in that suit for the property damage paid by the insurer. It is also undisputed that defendants had notice of plaintiff's subrogation rights prior to the settlement of the insured's suit and the signing of the release.
The precise question before us is whether an unlimited general release by an insured of all claims against a tortfeasor bars a subrogation action by an insurer-subrogee against that tortfeasor, where

Appellees' first counterpoint asserts:
Appellant has waived its right to complain of the trial court's action in granting appellees' motion for instructed verdict because appellant failed to attack in this appeal each and every independent ground contained in such motion.
In support of this counterpoint appellees argue that the points of error raised by appellant are germane only to two of the grounds included in the motion for instructed verdict and do not challenge the sufficiency of the other thirteen grounds. Consequently, appellees argue that appellant has failed to discharge its burden to establish that the instructed verdict cannot be supported on the other grounds stated. After this question was raised by appellees, appellant made no request for leave to amend its brief to include points and argument attacking the other grounds stated in the motion.
We agree with appellees that appellant's first four points all relate to the matter of the alleged agreement by appellees to assume the rental payments, and even if well taken, they do not establish that the instructed verdict cannot be sustained on other, independent grounds. Appellant's burden to show that the instructed verdict cannot be sustained on any of the grounds stated in the motion is established by the following cases: McKelvy v. Barber, 381 S.W.2d 59, 62 (Tex.1964); Dunham and Ross Co. v. Stevens, 538 S.W.2d 212, 214 (Tex.Civ.App.Waco 1976, no writ); Woodrum v. Long, 527 S.W.2d 281, 283 (Tex.Civ. App.Austin 1975, no writ); Carrico v. Stop-N-Go Markets of Texas, Inc., 492 S.W.2d 383, 384 (Tex.Civ.App.San Antonio 1973, no writ).
Some of the grounds stated in the motion for instructed verdict are obviously insufficient, such as general averments that "there is no evidence that warrants the submission of the case to the jury" and that "the evidence is wholly insufficient to warrant the submission of this case to the jury." Others are more substantial, at least on the face of the motion, and several relate to the defense that plaintiff cannot recover the rentals specified in the lease because the lease has been assigned to the Hillcrest National Bank. Appellant does not attack any of these grounds either by its points of error or in the argument under its points. This court should not undertake to search the record and investigate the authorities bearing on these independent grounds without the assistance of counsel for either party. Therefore, with respect to

Benson and Beckman did not discover anything;  they rediscovered something that Secretary Knox considered in 1913.  Thirty-eight states ratified the sixteenth amendment, and thirty-seven sent formal instruments of the ratification to the Secretary of State....  Only four instruments repeat the language of the sixteenth amendment exactly as Congress approved it.  The others contain errors of diction, capitalization, punctuation, and spelling.... [the defendant] insists that because the states did not approve exactly the same text, the amendment did not go into effect.  Secretary Knox considered this argument.  The Solicitor of the Department of State drew up a list of the errors in the instruments and--taking into account both the triviality of the deviations and the treatment of earlier amendments that had experienced more substantial problems--advised the Secretary that he was authorized to declare the amendment adopted.  The Secretary did so.... [his] decision is now beyond review.

Id. at 1253 (emphasis in original).  See also United States v. Stahl, 792 F.2d 1438, 1439 (9th Cir.1986), cert. denied 479 U.S. 1036, 107 S.Ct. 888, 93 L.Ed.2d 840 (1987) (propriety of the ratification process is a political question).


14
We find it hard to understand why the long and unbroken line of cases upholding the constitutionality of the sixteenth amendment generally, Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad Company, 240 U.S. 1, 36 S.Ct. 236, 60 L.Ed.2d 493 (1916), and those specifically rejecting the argument advanced in The Law That Never Was, have not persuaded Miller and his compatriots to seek a more effective forum for airing their attack on the federal income tax structure.  See Foster, 789 F.2d at 463 n. 6 (the propriety of the ratification of a constitutional amendment may be a non-justiciable political question).  Determined and persistent tax protesters like Miller seek to utilize the federal judicial forum without consideration of the significant limitations on the authority of both the district courts and the courts of appeal.  One such limitation stems from the bedrock principle of stare decisis:  lower courts are bound by the precedential authority of cases rendered by higher courts.  U.S. Ex Rel. Shore v. O'Leary

B. F-16 Contract
In the July 2002 Order, the Court acknowledged that Plaintiffs had pled facts raising a specter that the statements regarding the F-16s were misleading. See July 2002 Order at 13. However, since the statements regarding the F-16 contract are forward-looking, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that Defendants actually knew that the forward-looking statements were false or misleading when they were made and must plead facts sufficient to establish such knowledge in order to survive a motion to dismiss. See In re Splash Tech. Holdings Secs. Litig., 160 F.Supp.2d at 1069. Although Plaintiffs had repeatedly failed to plead facts sufficient to demonstrate *951 Defendants' knowledge, the Court granted leave to "amend the complaint to show that the Defendants actually knew that the allegedly misleading statements were false when made." July 2002 Order at 15. The CTAC incorporates few changes to the F-16 allegations, and the changes that have been made are clearly insufficient to meet the PSLRA's requirements.
Preliminarily, the allegations are legally insufficient because Plaintiffs' allegations about why Defendants had actual knowledge of the alleged facts are based solely upon conjecture. Plaintiffs attribute the knowledge not to any inside sources, documentation, or available public information; rather, Lockheed is claimed to have knowledge of the alleged facts because of its position as "the primary contractor for the manufacture of the F-16 fighter aircraft," (CTAC ¶ 73), and because "Boeing's F-15 was a major competitor to Lockheed's F-16," (CTAC ¶ 74). If these types of logical inferences and generalizations were sufficient to meet the PSLRA's requirements, plaintiffs could effectively manufacture support in any case to overcome the PSLRA's requirements.
In any event, Plaintiffs' allegations suffer from another shortcoming. Although Plaintiffs continue to allege that numerous sources of information existed that demonstrate the false or misleading nature of the F-16 statements, they muster facts sufficient only to allege that a portion of this information was known to Lockheed. Even if the Court were inclined to agree that this entire latter set of information was actually known to Lockheed, the Court would still find that information insufficient to demonstrate that Lockheed knew that its statements were false or misleading when made.
The items of information that Plaintiffs actually claim were known by Lockheed show only that the Block 60 technology was cutting-edge, not that Defendants knew that the United States would not allow sale of such technology to the UAE. That the United States

The test for determining admissibility of a photograph is whether it is a true and accurate representation of the subject which it purports to represent, as it existed at the time pertinent to inquiry. Elmore v. State, 414 So.2d 175 (Ala.Cr.App.1982); Osborn v. Brown, 361 So.2d 82 (Ala.1978).
The court in Osborn, supra, held that "... the determination as to the sufficiency of the preliminary proofs offered to identify the photograph or show that it is an accurate representation of the objects which it purports to portray is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reviewable except for gross abuse," at 86. Hurst v. State, 397 So.2d 203 (Ala.Cr.App.) cert. denied, 397 So.2d 208 (Ala.1981); Carpenter v. State, 400 So.2d 427 (Ala.1981); Moon v. Nolen, 294 Ala. 454, 318 So.2d 690 (1975).
*185 Generally, photographs are admissible if they are verified by a person familiar with the subject matter of the photograph and if they are relevant to some disputed or material issue, illustrate or elucidate some other relevant fact or evidence, or corroborate or contradict some other evidence offered. Photographs may also be admitted if they have some tendency to shed light on, strengthen, or illustrate other testimony in the case. Donner v. State, 409 So.2d 461 (Ala.Cr.App.1981).
Testimony of the State's witness established that the photographs correctly depicted the scene at the time they were taken. Both the murder weapon and the victim's body were certainly relevant in this trial. We find no abuse of discretion.
The fourth issue raised by appellant is whether the trial court erred in sentencing her to twenty years in the penitentiary under § 13A-5-6(a)(4) Code of Alabama 1975.
Appellant was convicted of murder, which is a class A felony under § 13A-6-2(c), Code of Alabama 1975. In regard to sentencing in Class A felony convictions, § 13A-5-6 reads in pertinent part:
"(4) For a Class A felony in which a firearm or deadly weapon was used or attempted to be used in the commission of the felony, not less than 20 years."
Appellant argues that this section is not mandatory and should not be applied in her case since there

2006 WL 1518938, at *1 (D.D.C. May 26, 2006) (“Where, as here,

the failure to state a claim is patent, ‘it is practical and

fully consistent with plaintiffs’ rights and the efficient use of

judicial resources’ for the Court to dismiss the action sua

sponte.”) (quoting Baker, 916 F.2d at 726).    Although the

complaint and attached exhibits are incoherent in substantial

part, the complaint arguably could be read to assert that Exelrod

       The civil cover sheet that Jennings completed when he
filed his complaint reflects that Jennings brings his case under
42 U.S.C. § 1983, the federal statute permitting suits to redress
violations of constitutional rights committed by individuals
acting under color of state law. The complaint does not recite
any grounds showing that Jennings is entitled to relief from

“us[ing] [Jennings’] bill” (Compl., Ex. B).     The complaint,

however, fails to allege facts that would “allow[] the court to

draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable,”

Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009), for a breach of

contract.   Jennings does not plead any factual content describing

the existence of a valid contract between the parties, an

obligation or duty arising out of the contract, a breach of that

duty, and damages caused by breach.     See Tsintolas Realty Co. v.

Mendez, 984 A.2d 181, 187 (D.C. 2009) (setting forth elements of

breach of contract claim).   In particular, to the extent that

Jennings asserts, without supporting factual allegations, the

existence of a contract for use of his bill entitling him to

“100.5 million 500,000 for a house like it state[s] in [the]

agreement” (Compl. at 2), the complaint is not plausible on its

face and could not survive a motion to dismiss.     Iqbal, 556 U.S.

      Alatorre’s transfer to the Public Works Office (PWO) in February 2012 does

not qualify as a tangible employment action because she did not show that

Bergamini was involved in the decision to transfer her, and Alatorre’s affidavit

portrays a positive experience at the PWO. Her transfer back to the Facilities and

Maintenance Division (FMD) in May 2012 does not qualify because her stint at the

PWO was always intended to be temporary. Moreover, Bergamini and Grant were

placed on administrative leave for three weeks immediately after Alatorre filed her

informal EEO complaint. Thus, her return to the FMD lasted, at most, slightly

more than a fortnight. As for her assignment to online training courses, Alatorre

did not meet her burden to show a causal nexus between this assignment and

Bergamini’s alleged sexual harassment.

      Since no tangible employment action occurred, the Navy was entitled to

raise its affirmative defense, and it did so successfully. In response to Alatorre’s

first complaint about Bergamini, the Navy temporarily transferred her to the PWO.

The FMD held a meeting emphasizing the Navy’s zero-tolerance policy after

Alatorre returned. When Alatorre filed an informal EEO complaint, the Navy

placed Bergamini (and Grant) on administrative leave, transferred Alatorre to the

PWO for the second time, and later hired a former EEOC Administrative Law

Judge to conduct an investigation of her complaints. The Navy “exercised


                                           3
reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior,”

and by delaying, Alatorre “unreasonably failed” to avail herself of the available

corrective mechanisms. See Hardage, 427 F.3d at 1183–84.

      3. Alatorre did not establish a prima facie case of co-worker harassment. To

make out such a claim, she was required to show that she “was subjected to verbal

or physical conduct of a sexual nature, . . . that was unwelcome; and . . . that was

sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of [her] employment and

create an abusive working environment.” E.E.O.C.

OPINION

PER CURIAM:

James E. McGill appeals from the district court's order denying his
motion for the return of property. Because the district court did not
abuse its discretion in denying the motion, we affirm. See Ramsden
v. United States, 2 F.3d 322, 324 (9th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, ___
U.S. ___, 62 U.S.L.W. 3705 (U.S. Apr. 25, 1994) (No. 93-8393).

On appeal, McGill seeks to remove the restraining order placed on
his savings bonds subsequent to his indictment. Although the savings
bonds are not tainted proceeds from his conviction, they are properly
subject to forfeiture as substitute assets pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A.
§ 982(b)(1)(A) (West Supp. 1995). In his plea agreement, McGill
expressly agreed that forfeiture could be obtained against any of his
untainted assets in the event directly forfeitable assets were unavail-
able. He further agreed that he would not contest efforts to forfeit
such substitute assets. Furthermore, he agreed at the time of his guilty
plea to the continuing restraint of substitute assets "until the conclu-
sion of all matters, including appeals and forfeiture proceedings, relat-
ing to this case."

Although the restraining order was placed on McGill's savings
bonds before his conviction, this court has upheld pre-trial restraints
on substitute assets. See In re Billman, 915 F.2d 9

'In fact, the ultimate answer to the 'extra-hazardous' argument in this case is that the principle simply does not apply when the inquiry is confined exclusively to whether the highway traveler was contributorily negligent, because the hazards of the crossing, whatever they are and whatever their degree, are necessarily embraced in that inquiry anyway.'


58
The highest court in Kentucky has well stated the obligation of a motorist in approaching a railroad track.


59
'The obligation imposed upon every person to exercise ordinary care for his own safety requires that, in approaching a railroad track, he must use his senses in the way that an ordinarily prudent person would under similar circumstances, in order to determine whether it is safe to cross the track at that time.  Where the facts make it certain that a traveler could have seen or heard an approaching train in time to avert a collision, had he looked and listened properly, he will not be heard to say that he looked for the train but did not see it, or that he listened for it and did not hear it.'

61
In Meadows v. Chesapeake & Ohio R.R., 412 S.W.2d 233 (Ky.1967), the Court was faced with a situation similar in some respects to the one before us.  The motorist approached a railroad crossing on a clear night.  The crossing, with which the motorist was familiar, was described as extrahazardous because it carried heavy train traffic and the view was substantially obstructed until the motorist was within ten or fifteen feet of the tracks.  The motorist stopped within fifteen feet of the track and then proceeded slowly across the tracks and was struck by a train.  The Court observed:

Claims 1 through 7 relate to a process and an apparatus for making, by "spot" welding (i. e., electrical resistance welding) electrical connections between electrical conductors, one or more of which is embedded in thermoplastic (heat sensitive) insulating material.


3
The process (claims 2, 3, 5 and 6) involves the following steps: First, the conductors that are to be welded together are juxtaposed and an electrode positioned at the outer side of each one.  Second, the electrodes are then heated and are simultaneously pressed against the conductors.  Finally, when the heat and pressure have softened and displaced the thermoplastic insulation and the conductors have made electrical (i. e., metal-to-metal) contact, a welding current is passed from the one electrode through the conductors to the other electrode, causing a welded electrical connection at the point of contact between the two conductors.

1. The record manifests that the process employed to effect such joinder is wholly within the ingenuity and skill of the ordinary mechanic in the art to which the subject matter pertains.  Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1966).  Several "prior art" patents are especially pertinent to this conclusion: U.S. Patent No. 1,613,959, issued in 1927 to Harry DeForrest Madden, relates to a method and machine to weld a coated (i. e., insulated) lead-in wire to the base of an incandescent lamp. "A preferable mode of practicing the present invention," says the patent description, "is to provide a heating element comprising a resistance body, such as a rod of carbon, tungsten or the like, and to pass a current therethrough to permit the resistant property of the element to generate the proper degree of heat therein.  The heating element may be moved in contact with a wire positioned for welding in order to heat treat and render the coating non-resistant, after which suitable cooperating mechanism may be utilized to cause a welding operation by permitting a flow of electrical current through the bodies to be welded.  The heating element may serve to impart heat to the body to be welded and as a terminal or electrode to carry a welding current."

U.S. Patent No. 2,977,672, issued in 1961 to T. A. Telfer, teaches a

Before its repeal in 1982,[1] CETA provided for grants of federal funds to certain qualified entities known as "prime sponsors," principally state and local governments, for programs "provid[ing] job training and employment opportunities for economically disadvantaged, unemployed, or underemployed persons," 29 U. S. C. § 801 (1976 ed., Supp. V).[2] The statute contains detailed requirements concerning the operation of a CETA program and the training, pay, and terms of employment of participants in a program, see §§ 823-827. A prime sponsor must submit to the Secretary a plan detailing the operation of the proposed program and containing assurances that the program will comply with the statute and with the Secretary's regulations, § 813.
CETA grants the Secretary broad authority to ensure that CETA funds are used in accordance with the statute and regulations. The Secretary may audit a grant recipient, and in connection with such an audit may inspect records, question employees, and enter any premises upon which the program is conducted. § 835(a)(2). Any interested person, such as a participating employee, may file a complaint with the Secretary alleging that a grant recipient is failing to comply with the applicable standards. § 816.
Section 106(b), 29 U. S. C. § 816(b), which is the provision at issue in this lawsuit, requires that whenever the Secretary *256 has reason to believe, through a complaint, an audit, or otherwise, that any grant recipient is misusing CETA funds or violating any statutory or regulatory standards, the Secretary "shall investigate the matter."[3] The same section goes on to require that the Secretary "shall" determine "the truth of the allegation or belief involved, not later than 120 days after receiving the complaint."

II
Respondent is a county in the State of Washington that received CETA funds from 1974 through 1977 pursuant to two separate grants. On September 19, 1978, the Labor Department's Office of Special Investigations filed an audit report concerning respondent's first grant. That Department's Grant Officer issued a final determination on February 13, 1981, disallowing approximately $110,000 in costs incurred by respondent on the grounds that those costs related to employees who were not eligible to participate in a CETA program. On December 11, 1978, the Department's Office of the Inspector General filed an audit report with respect to the second grant, again raising questions concerning ineligible *

The Assistant State's Attorney who tried this case testified in this Court that one of the reasons for halt of the trial and going into the Judge's chambers was because he and the Judge felt that Buxton was prejudicing the defendant in the presence of the jury.
A few days after this trial and on behalf of the Macon County Bar Association, the Assistant State's Attorney who had tried the case prepared and filed an information in the Circuit Court of Macon County seeking to disbar and suspend the Attorney Buxton from practice in the Circuit Court of Macon County, because of Buxton's alleged subornation of perjury in another case tried about that time and partly because of his demonstrated incompetence in the trial of this petitioner. In that petition it was alleged and afterwards found by the Circuit Court who tried this case that Buxton was not capable of protecting the rights of litigants in any Court, either civil or criminal, or of practicing law before any Court and suspended him from practice. His name was afterwards, on his own motion, stricken from the roll of attorneys by the Supreme Court of Illinois, so he is no longer an attorney of the Bar of this State.
It would have been possible in this case with available funds to have given this Court a much clearer picture of what actually happened in this trial and it would have been much more satisfactory to the Court if the Attorney General had seen fit to call the Trial Judge to the witness stand while he was sitting in Court. It is difficult to get an actual picture of what actually happened in the courtroom during this trial from what has been presented, but the petitioner presented a long list of witnesses whom he wished called and who could not be called because of their distance from Chicago and the lack of money to advance their mileage and witness fees at approximately $25 each, or even to take their depositions at considerable stenographic charge. The Attorney General could have brought in this evidence, and to some degree I think myself justified in drawing unfavorable inferences from his failure to do so. Clearly there is enough before the Court to justify the inferences I have drawn and it is certain that the people of the State of Illinois possess the resources to have given a more complete picture of the matter had they seen fit to do so. There is in the record a copy of a petition sent to the Parole Board of Illinois, asking release of this prisoner, a statement that he did not have a fair trial which is signed by 53 residents of Decatur and the first signer was foreman of the jury

                                          2                                     16-740

Also, while I do concur with the majority's resolution concerning defendant's extended-term sentence for armed robbery based on the Illinois Supreme Court's decision in People v. Neal (1985), 111 Ill.2d 180, 489 N.E.2d 845, cert. denied (1986), 476 U.S. 1165, 90 L.Ed.2d 733, 106 S.Ct. 2292), I do, however, find the majority's reasoning a bit ironic. The Neal case upheld the extended-term sentence for the burglary conviction there under the extended-term statute even though the court had imposed a death sentence on the murder conviction. Interestingly, the basis for the majority's conclusion here, that the Neal case was controlling, is that the imposition of the life sentence in the present case was analogous to the death sentence in Neal for purposes of considering the extended-term sentence. Nevertheless, the majority found the defendant's life sentence, without possibility of parole, not analogous to the death penalty sentence in Skipper for purposes of considering mitigating evidence regarding the defendant's rehabilitation and potential for rehabilitation.
Contrary to the majority's differentiation, I believe that the imposition of the death sentence and the defendant's life sentence without the possibility of parole are analogous in both situations and particularly so for purposes of requiring the sentencing judge to consider proffered relevant mitigating evidence before imposing a life sentence without the possibility for parole. Of course, the weight to be given to the mitigating evidence is for the trial judge to determine. (See Eddings v. Oklahoma (1982), 455 U.S. 104, 114-15, 71 L.Ed.2d 1, 11, 102 S.Ct. 869, 877). However, to not require a trial judge to consider such relevant evidence would allow the judge to disregard the sentencing scheme set forth in the Code of Corrections and required by our constitution. (Cf. Williams v. New York (1949), 337 U.S. 241, 245, 93 L.Ed. 1337, 1341, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 1083.) Mr. Young was entitled to have a sentence imposed that takes into account his potential, if any, to be rehabilitated and to reenter society, if possible, as a productive individual. The failure to consider the evidence proffered by the defendant here did not offer him this opportunity.
Accordingly, I would vacate the sentence imposed by the trial court and remand the matter for resentencing of the defendant consistent with the views expressed

I. Background

2
On May 13, 1991, FBI agents received information from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) that more than one million dollars had been skimmed from seven different HUD-insured and/or co-insured multi-family housing projects that were owned and operated by Sharma and several of her family members.


3
Sharma pleaded guilty to a one-count information charging her with program fraud in the amount of $101,467.89 in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 666, and 2.  Her offense level was calculated to be twelve, with a criminal history category of one, providing for a sentencing range of ten to sixteen months' imprisonment (part of the term of which may be satisfied by supervised release) and a fine of $3,000 to $30,000.   See U.S.S.G. §§ 5C1.1(d) and 5E1.2(c)(3).


4
The district court initially sentenced Sharma to five months' imprisonment and three years' supervised release.   It ordered her to pay $101,467.89 in restitution and assessed a fine of $100,000.   In a motion for correction of sentence, Sharma contested the $100,000 fine as an improper departure from the Guidelines.   In response to this motion, the district court vacated the first sentence and gave the required notice that the court was considering an upward departure with respect to the fine.   See Burns v. United States, 501 U.S. 129, 138, 111 S.Ct. 2182, 2187, 115 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991) (requiring a district court to give notice of intent to depart from Guidelines).   The court then entered an order clarifying that the sentence was not an upward departure under the Guidelines, but again noted that if the fine were construed to be a departure the order was notice that the court was contemplating such a departure.   Upon resentencing, in addition to imprisonment, supervised release, and restitution, a $100,000 fine was again imposed.   Sharma appeals that fine, arguing that it falls outside the applicable guidelines range;  that the court failed to adequately justify its upward departure from

BACKGROUND[1]
A. The Contracts
Penthouse is the successor in interest to General Media, Inc., a reorganized chapter *338 11 debtor, (Amended Complaint, ¶ 2) (ECF Doc. # 45 filed in Adv. Proc. No. 05-03658), and the two are referred to collectively as the Debtor. The Debtor had employed the plaintiff in various capacities for approximately 33 years. (Id., at ¶ 14.) The Debtor induced the plaintiff to continue to work by promising that it would pay the educational expenses of her children, grant her vacation time, and pay severance benefits. In addition, after the Debtor filed for bankruptcy (in August 2003), she was promised continued employment as part of the reorganization plan. (Id., at ¶ 15.)
The Debtor confirmed the Fourth Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization (the "Plan") (ECF Doc. # 642)[2] by order dated August 13, 2004 ("Confirmation Order"). (ECF Doc. # 649.) The Plan incorporated a Fourth Amended Plan Supplement, dated Aug. 12, 2004 ("Plan Supplement")(ECF Doc. # 644) that included two unsigned agreements central to the plaintiff's tort claims.[3] Under the first, a Consulting Agreement between the Debtor and General Media International, Inc. ("GMII"), a non-debtor affiliate, the Debtor agreed to engage GMII to provide the consulting services of GMII's principal, Robert C. Guccione, for 10 years. The Consulting Agreement did not mention the plaintiff, and contained a negating clause to the effect that the parties did not intend to create enforceable rights on behalf of any third parties:
No party shall assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns, but no other person shall acquire or have any rights under or by virtue of this Agreement.

(Consulting Agreement, at § 8.04)(emphasis added.)
The second agreement, a Letter Agreement between Guccione and the Debtor, which was attached as Exhibit A to the Consulting Agreement, is the more important one. Paragraph 4 stated in pertinent part:
The Company [the Debtor] shall provide Consultant [Guccione] with one full-time assistant, namely Jane Homlish [the plaintiff] (or such other person

dependency treatment facility; the order expired upon his release in 1992. After Doug failed to pay

child support and visited the boys sporadically, his parental rights were terminated in 1996. Phillips

testified that she last had face-to-face contact with the boys in November 1996, shortly after the

termination, and last spoke with them on the telephone in December 1996. Sailor testified that the

last contacts were in 1997. In 1998, Sailor’s current husband adopted the boys, who took his last

name.

                In 2000, Phillips filed her petition for grandparent access to the boys. Sailor stated

in her answer that Phillips’s request was not in the children’s best interest. After a non-jury trial, the

court found that contact with Phillips was in the children’s best interest. The trial court ordered at

least monthly contact on the telephone, one week of possession each summer if Phillips gave written

notice to Sailor by May 1 of each year specifying the requested week, and three days at Christmas

if Phillips provided thirty days’ notice each year of the requested days. The court ordered that Doug

not be present when Phillips had possession of the boys.

                Sailor contends by her first issue that the visitation order and the statute authorizing

it, Family Code section 153.433, violate her due process right to autonomy in child-rearing decisions.

Considering a similar argument shortly after Sailor filed her brief, this Court held that neither section

153.433 nor an order requiring grandparent visitation violated the parents’ due-process rights under

the Fourteenth Amendment. Lilley v. Lilley, 43 S.W.3d 703, 710-713 (Tex. App.—Austin 2001, no

pet.). We find no reason to alter our decision regarding the facial constitutionality of the statute. We

will examine the constitutionality of the statute as it was applied to Sailor after a review of the

testimony.

                    By her second issue, Sailor contends that the district court abused its discretion by

ordering visitation with Phillips. The only element of Family Code section 153.433 in dispute is

whether the visitation is in the children’s best interest.1

                    A trial court has broad discretion in determining the best interest of a child in visitation

II. ANALYSIS

A. The Limitation of Liability Act
Dravo first argues that this court must retain exclusive jurisdiction and maintain a concursus, or a concourse of the parties,[4] to prevent duplicity of litigation. Memorandum in Response to Opposition to Motion to Enjoin State Court Actions at 5-6. The court finds it necessary to address Dravo's arguments in support of its motion to enjoin by examining the purposes for which Congress enacted the Limitation Act in the context of this case. In so doing, the court first addresses the issue of whether Dravo, as manufacturer of the vessel in question, may object to further proceedings in the state court where neither the vessel owner, the owner pro hac vice, nor their insurers have been named as parties and no evidence exists that any such party may be subject to liability exceeding the value of the limitation fund.
This court, in commenting on the purposes of the Limitation Act, has noted that:
The Limitation Act serves the obvious purpose of limiting the liability of shipowners, and also protecting the shipowner from the risk of inconsistent judgments arising from a multiplicity of actions, and enabling the admiralty court to equitably distribute a limited fund among a number of claimants.... [T]he Act was also designed to foster the growth of the shipping industry.
Ray v. Lykes Bros. S.S. Co., 626 F.Supp. 120, 124 (E.D.La.1985) (citations omitted), vacated on other grounds, 805 F.2d 552 (5th Cir.1986). A shipowner invokes the Act's provisions by filing a complaint for exoneration from or limitation of liability. 46 U.S.C.App. § 185 (1988). Upon compliance with the statute's requirements, the Limitation Act provides that "all claims and *131 proceedings against the owner with respect to the matter in question shall cease." Id. (emphasis added). In addition, a bareboat charterer such as Newpark may be deemed an owner pro hac vice and seek protection under the Act. See id. § 186. The Act, therefore, clearly provides the federal court sitting in admiralty with the power necessary to protect shipowners and, in some cases, charterers, who face multiple claims arising from a single marine disaster.
Rule F of the Supplemental Admiralty Rules further defines the procedural requirements to invoke the Act's protections. This rule provides that "[o]

                          OPINION

CLIFTON, Circuit Judge:

   This case requires us to consider whether a broad release of
claims in a nationwide settlement agreement between Sprint
and its customers precludes the present class action involving
a Washington state tax that Sprint invoiced to its Washington
customers. That nationwide settlement arose out of a lawsuit
that challenged Sprint’s billing of customers for certain fed-
eral regulatory fees. Because we conclude that the Washing-
ton Plaintiffs’ interests were not adequately represented in the
prior action and that their claims are not “based on the identi-
cal factual predicate as that underlying the claims in the set-
tled class action,” Williams v. Boeing Co., 517 F.3d 1120,
1133 (9th Cir. 2008), we hold that the prior settlement did not
release the claims at issue in this case, and we vacate the dis-
trict court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of Sprint.

I.   Background

   The State of Washington imposes a business and occupa-
tion tax (“B&O tax”) on every person engaged in business
activities in the state. Wash. Rev. Code § 82.04.220. Wash-
ington law specifies that the B&O tax must be collected from
a business as part of its “operating overhead” rather than
imposed as a separate “tax[ ] upon the purchasers or custom-
3850                    HESSE v. SPRINT

B.
While it might be argued that § 346(h) applies for tax purposes only,[11] careful examination of the legislative history confirms that estate property includes a debtor-in-possession's right to carry forward an NOL.
The identical reports of both houses of Congress observed with respect to § 541(a)(1):

*837 the estate is comprised of all legal or equitable interest of the debtor in property, wherever located, as of the commencement of the case. The scope of this paragraph is broad. It includes all kinds of property, including tangible or intangible property, cause of action (see Bankruptcy Act § 70a(6)), and all other forms of property currently specified in section 70a of the Bankruptcy Act § 70a. The result of Segal v. Rochelle, 382 U.S. 375 [86 S.Ct. 511, 15 L.Ed.2d 428] (1966), is followed,

and the right to a refund is property of the estate. H.R.Rep. No. 95-595, 95th Cong. 1st Sess. 367 (1977); S.Rep. No. 95-989, 95th Cong.2d Sess. 82 (1978) (emphasis added), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1978, pp. 5868, 6323.
Segal v. Rochelle, 382 U.S. 375, 86 S.Ct. 511, 15 L.Ed.2d 428 (1966), involved the closely analogous issue of whether a NOL carryback is property of a bankruptcy estate. The debtors, two partners and their partnership, commenced their bankruptcy cases by filing bankruptcy petitions at the end of the third quarter of 1961. After the close of that calendar year, the partners filed for tax refunds for the two years prior to the year of the bankruptcy by applying and carrying back losses incurred by the partnership in 1961 prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petitions. The Court held that the potential claims for loss carryback refunds due to pre-bankruptcy losses are property of the estate.
In so holding, the Court ruled that bankruptcy purposes controlled the definition of property under § 70(a)(5) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. § 110(a)(5) (1970) (repealed), the predecessor to § 541(a)(1), rather the meanings attributed to "property" in other contexts. It added

OPINION

PER CURIAM:

Julianne Malveaux appeals from the judgment order of the district
court finding her guilty of assaulting an airline attendant during a
flight, in violation of 49 U.S.C. § 46506 (1994) and 18 U.S.C.
§ 113(a)(4) (1994). Initially, Malveaux contends that the district court
erred by denying her motion for acquittal because the evidence was
insufficient to support her conviction. Because Malveaux made this
motion at the close of the Government's case, but did not renew it at
the close of her case, we need only consider whether Malveaux's con-
viction resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice. See United States
v. Vaquero, 997 F.2d 78, 82 (5th Cir. 1993).

The evidence in this case, however, firmly supported the district
court's finding of guilt. The pertinent statute proscribes assault by
striking, beating, or wounding. The statute has been construed by
courts to be akin to a common law simple battery, requiring physical
contact. See United States v. Guilbert, 692 F.2d 1340, 1344 (11th Cir.
1982);

Appellee remarried in June of 1978. On April 2, 1979, appellant received a letter from counsel for appellee seeking appellant's consent to adoption of R.W.G. by appellee's new *313 spouse. Appellant did not respond to the letter, nor did he take any other action manifesting an interest in the child.
On October 12, 1979, more than six months after appellant received the letter requesting his consent to adoption, appellee and her spouse commenced the present proceedings by filing a petition for involuntary termination of appellant's parental rights. A hearing on the petition was held in January of 1980. Appellant, represented by counsel, claimed that since his last contact with R.W.G. in August of 1977 he had made frequent trips to Tidioute to visit R.W.G. Appellant maintained that he was unable to locate the child because appellee had "secreted" herself and R.W.G. Appellant, however, failed to show either that his trips to Tidioute continued after receipt of the letter seeking his consent to adoption or that despite the letter appellee had continued to "secret" herself and R.W.G.[2]
The orphans' court determined that "[appellee] did not attempt to seclude herself and the child or conceal her identity or whereabouts from [appellant]." Relying primarily upon appellant's failure to respond to the letter seeking appellant's consent to adoption, the court concluded that termination of appellant's parental rights was justified under section 311(1).
Well-established is our scope of review:
"The findings of the orphans' court, supported by competent evidence, `must be sustained unless the court abused its discretion or committed an error of law.' In re William L., 477 Pa. 322, 340, 383 A.2d 1228, 1237, cert. denied, 439 U.S. 880, 99 S.Ct. 216 [58 L.Ed.2d 192] (1978); accord, e.g., Wertman Estate, 462 Pa. 195, 340 A.2d 429 (1975); Estate of Lanning, 414 Pa. 313, 200 A.2d 392 (1964). We must accept as true all evidence in the record supporting the findings of the court and reasonable inferences therefrom. E.g., In re William L., 477 Pa. at 340 n.12, 383 A.2d at 1237 n.12; see Kay v. Kay, 460 Pa. 680, 334 A.

6      Evidence Code section 210 defines relevant evidence as “evidence, including
evidence relevant to the credibility of a witness or hearsay declarant, having any tendency
in reason to prove or disprove any disputed fact that is of consequence to the
determination of the action.” Evidence Code section 350 provides: “No evidence is
admissible except relevant evidence.”
7       Evidence Code section 352 provides, in relevant part: “The court in its discretion
may exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability
that its admission will … create substantial danger of undue prejudice ….”


                                              7
       We note first that there was no testimony that appellant committed the July 11
burglary and the prosecutor did not argue that such an inference could be drawn from the
evidence presented. However, even assuming that the jury drew the inference that
appellant burglarized the house the day prior to the day of the offenses charged in the
instant case, any error in admitting evidence of the July 11 burglary was harmless.
       First, there was no dispute appellant entered the garage attached to the house;
Deputy Wells testified appellant stated he went to the house with the intention of stealing
“stuff”; and appellant testified to essentially the same thing. Thus, the jury heard
compelling evidence, in the form of Deputy Wells’s testimony of appellant’s statements
and appellant’s own testimony, that appellant entered the garage attached to the house
with the intent to steal property located within, and thus that he committed the instant
burglary. (See § 459 [burglary consists of entry into, inter alia, any “house,” “with intent
to commit grand or petit larceny”].) Therefore, to the extent the evidence of the July 11
burglary showed appellant had a propensity to commit burglary and other criminal acts,
the overwhelming and properly admitted evidence that appellant burglarized the garage
the next day showed exactly the same thing. The challenged evidence added virtually
nothing to the prosecution case. And because the purported uncharged act evidence and
the evidence of the July 12 burglary related to the same kind of act—a burglary—the
former evidence was “no stronger and no more inflammatory than the testimony
concerning the charged offenses.” (People v. Ewoldt (1994) 7 Cal.4th 380, 405.)
       “[S]tate law error in admitting evidence is subject to the traditional Watson

       In 2010, the City brought a nuisance abatement action in San Diego County

Superior Court against Adler, Charlton Adler, McDini's, and the Adler Howard Trust,

entitled People v. Adler, San Diego Superior Court Case No. 37-2010-00092488-CU-

MC-CTL (Abatement Action). The Abatement Action was based, in part, on the

defendants' failure to comply with CUP 2009-09's live entertainment conditions.

       On December 17, 2010, the court in the Abatement Action entered a stipulated

judgment requiring McDini's to immediately cease all operations. The judgment was

conditionally stayed provided, among other things, that McDini's applied for a new CUP

within 60 days and in the interim ceased all live entertainment. The stipulated judgment

provided that the City could seek enforcement of it by ex parte application for failure to

comply with its terms.

       McDini's applied for and was granted CUP 2010-33 by National City's planning

commission, which the City Council approved in February 2012 through City council

                                             2
resolution 2012-49, and live entertainment was again allowed at McDini's subject to a

number of specific conditions. McDini's permission to have live entertainment was

subject to revocation by the City, if, among other things, the chief of police determined

that the reinstatement of live entertainment resulted in or significantly contributed to a 10

percent increase in the demand for police services at McDini's between the hours of

5:00 p.m. and 3:00 a.m.

       On March 27, 2012, the December 17, 2010 stipulated judgment in the Abatement

Action was amended to allow for live entertainment at McDini's provided McDini's

operated in compliance with resolution 2012-49's conditions. The March 27, 2012

amended stipulated judgment further allowed the City to proceed by ex parte application

to reinstitute the December 17, 2010 stipulated judgment's prohibition of live

entertainment for McDini's failure to comply with resolution 2012-49's conditions.

       In March 2013, the planning commission undertook an annual review of CUP

2010-33. After concluding that McDini's failed to comply with resolution 2012-49's

conditions, and

agreement was accepted. Dismissal of Count I appears to have proceeded from

the assumption of court personnel that the plea agreement had been accepted.

Although judgment entered reflects Count I was dismissed “on motion of the


                                           -4-
United States,” the government did not move for dismissal of Count I.      Id.

Further, we find no evidence in the record to indicate, as Biggs suggests, that

Count I was dismissed pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 48(b) for “unnecessary delay

in bringing a defendant to trial.”   See Appellee’s Br. at 11.

       Considered collectively, the statements and conduct of the district court

throughout the proceedings are consistent both with acceptance and rejection of

the plea agreement. Nowhere in the record did the court explicitly and

unambiguously accept or reject the plea agreement as required under Rule

11(e)(3) and (4). We are therefore compelled to remand this case to the district

court with directions to vacate Biggs’ sentence and to reinstate Count I. The

district court should then explicitly accept or reject the plea agreement. If the

court accepts the agreement and so finds on the record in accordance with Rule

11(e)(3), then under Veri , it must sentence Biggs to thirty-six months’

imprisonment as contemplated by the plea agreement. If the court rejects the

agreement, it must so advise Biggs in accordance with Rule 11(e)(4) and proceed

accordingly.

conduct of the district court throughout the proceedings are consistent both with

acceptance and rejection of the plea agreement.” Maj. Op. at 5. However, the

government’s argument that the district court erred by imposing a thirty-month

NO. WR-78,270-01


EX PARTE RICKEY DON WILLIAMS, Applicant





ON APPLICATION FOR A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
CAUSE NO. 17440-B IN THE 104TH DISTRICT COURT

FROM TAYLOR COUNTY



Per curiam.
 
O R D E R


	Pursuant to the provisions of Article 11.07 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, the
clerk of the trial court transmitted to this Court this application for a writ of habeas corpus.  Ex parte
Young, 418 S.W.2d 824, 826 (Tex. Crim. App. 1967).  Applicant pleaded guilty to possession of
marijuana in a drug free zone, and originally received ten years, probated.  His probation was later
revoked, and he was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment.  He did not appeal his conviction.
	Applicant contends, inter alia, that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance because 
counsel failed to investigate, failed to object to a defective indictment, and advised Applicant to
plead guilty.  Applicant alleges that he would not have pleaded guilty but for counsel's erroneous
advice.  
	Applicant has alleged facts that, if true, might entitle him to relief.  Strickland v. Washington,
466 U.S. 668 (1984); Ex parte Patterson, 993 S.W.2d 114, 115 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999).  In these
circumstances, additional facts are needed.  As we held in Ex parte Rodriguez, 334 S.W.2d 294, 294
(Tex. Crim. App. 1960), the trial court is the appropriate forum for findings of fact.  The trial court
shall order trial counsel to respond to Applicant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.  The
trial court may use any means set out in Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 11.07, § 3(d).
	If the trial court elects to hold a hearing, it shall determine whether Applicant is indigent. 
If Applicant is indigent and wishes to be represented by counsel, the trial court shall appoint an
attorney to represent Applicant at the hearing.

This appeal comes before the court on certification from the court of appeals. Section 809.61, Stats., 1985-86. The court of appeals certified the following question to this court: "Whether payment of the $150 filing fee under Rule 809.25(2)(a)1. is a prerequisite to filing a notice of appeal."
We conclude that a notice of appeal is filed on the day the clerk of the trial court receives the notice of appeal, whether or not the notice of appeal is accompanied by the $150 filing fee. Because the clerk of the circuit court in this case received the notice of appeal within the time period prescribed by statute, we conclude that the court of appeals obtained jurisdiction over this appeal. Accordingly, we deny the defendants' motion to dismiss the appeal for failure to file a notice of appeal in a timely manner.
The facts giving rise to the motion are not in dispute.[1] On October 1, 1986, the circuit court for *332 Menominee and Shawano counties, Thomas G. Grover, circuit judge, entered judgment after a jury *333 verdict dismissing the plaintiffs' complaint on its merits. The parties agree that the last day on which *334 the plaintiffs could initiate a timely appeal from this judgment was November 17, 1986. A notice of appeal filed on November 18, 1986, would have been filed too late.
According to the findings of fact of the circuit court, the clerk of the circuit court received in its regular mail delivery of

RYDER, Judge.
Hancel Drew Platt was convicted by a jury of DWI manslaughter and vehicular homicide. The trial court adjudged Platt guilty of both crimes, but only pronounced sentence for the conviction of DWI manslaughter. Platt asserts error in the trial court's denial of his motions for judgment of acquittal for each of these two crimes and in the trial court's adjudging Platt guilty of both crimes. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand this case to the trial court.
The motion for judgment of acquittal on the charge of DWI manslaughter was properly denied by the trial court. The evidence was sufficient to allow the jury to consider and decide this charge. Tsavaris v. State, 414 So.2d 1087 (Fla. 2d DCA 1982), petition for review denied, 424 So.2d 763 (Fla. 1983). See also Muwwakil v. State, 435 So.2d 304 (Fla. 3d DCA 1983). Moreover, the evidence supports Platt's conviction for DWI manslaughter. We affirm that conviction and the sentence imposed thereon.
We do not reach the question of whether the trial court properly denied the motion for judgment of acquittal on the charge of vehicular homicide. The issue is moot as we hold that the trial court erred by adjudging Platt guilty of vehicular homicide.
One person, Terry D. Collins, died as a result of injuries received in the automobile collision involving the vehicles driven by Platt and Collins. Platt caused a single death and could not be convicted of both DWI manslaughter and vehicular homicide. Ubelis v. State, 384 So.2d 1294 (Fla. 2d DCA 1980). Therefore, we reverse the judgment of guilt of vehicular homicide. This case is remanded to the trial court with instructions to set aside the judgment of guilt on vehicular homicide.
The conviction of DWI manslaughter is AFFIRMED, the conviction of vehicular homicide is REVERSED, and this case is REMANDED with instructions.

*805 Before HENDRY and HAVERFIELD, JJ., and CHARLES CARROLL (Ret.), Associate Judge.
PER CURIAM.
Plaintiff-appellant, Thomas E. Flowers, seeks review of a summary final judgment entered in favor of the defendant-appellees in this action for breach of contract. The controlling question is whether the contract sought to be enforced was an oral agreement within the Statute of Frauds (§ 725.01, Fla. Stat., F.S.A.) in that it was an "... agreement that is not to be performed within the space of one year from the making thereof."
Defendants, desirous of becoming the management organization of Interama, contacted Flowers because of his reputation in the field of management and development. The parties discussed the possibility of the plaintiff lending his name and reputation to the defendants, moving from his residence in California to Florida and becoming an employee of the defendants with respect to their expected management contract with Interama. Subsequently, plaintiff and defendants entered into an oral contract which according to plaintiff provided as follows:
(1) If Flowers would abandon his California interest, commit himself to the FINLEY-GREEN JOINT VENTURE, allow the defendants to use his name, reputation, and commitment in their attempt to obtain the Interama contract, and move to Florida for the purposes of contributing his services, Flowers would receive a 7 1/2% interest in said management organization.
(2) If Flowers would remain in Florida, in the capacity of an employee of the defendants, for a period of five years, contribute his services and expertise to the joint venture, he would receive a salary of $50,000 per year.
Defendant-appellees thereafter entered into a contract with Interama and became the management organization thereof. Thereupon, Flowers abandoned his California interests, moved to Florida and began working for the defendants. Flowers then made several demands for the 7 1/2% interest, but to no avail. Eight months after he moved to Florida, defendants discharged Flowers. Plaintiff-appellant Flowers filed a complaint against the defendants and sought to enforce both provisions, 1 and 2

25
The government also argued that a departure was appropriate under Sec. 5K2.9, because Chunza had committed the false registration offense in order to facilitate or conceal the commission of his offenses in Colombia.  In opposition, Singer contended that there was "absolutely no evidence" showing that Chunza was in the United States to collect drug money on behalf of Escobar.  The presentence report revealed that Chunza has lived in the United States for a few years and has worked in several entry-level positions.  In response to the unidentified witness's testimony that Chunza had come to the United States to collect money for Escobar, Singer urged that this testimony was unreliable because it was "remote hearsay."


26
Singer also objected to basing an upward departure on the allegation that Chunza had come to the United States to escape prosecution in Colombia.  None of the arrest warrants for Chunza was issued until after he arrived in the United States.  Singer contended that Chunza had fled to the United States because of attempts on his life, a claim that was supported by newspaper articles and letters that Chunza had sent to the Colombian authorities.  The government admitted that it had inferred that Chunza had come to the United States to avoid prosecution, because it believed, without sufficient evidence, that the three arrest warrants for Chunza had been issued or authorized before he left Colombia.  However, the government was wrong, because the warrants were not issued until nearly two-and-one-half years later, in March 1993.


27
After hearing the arguments of both counsel, Judge Nickerson agreed with the government and stated that


28
it seems to me that certainly by a preponderance of the evidence Mr. Chunza was a member of the Medellin Cartel.  He committed criminal acts at the behest of Mr. Pablo Escobar and came to the United States both to assist Escobar in collecting money--and I think it's a fair inference that he also came to the United States to avoid further prosecution.  It's a fair inference even if the warrants were issued afterwards that he knew he was going to be subject to prosecution.


29
The judge found that this evidence warranted upward departures, to criminal history category IV and offense level 20, so he sentenced Chunza to two, concurrent, five-year prison terms, three years' supervised release, and a $100 mandatory special assessment.

Before BOYD, C.J., QUINN and REAVIS, J.J.

       Johanson Lee Watson petitions the court for a writ of mandamus asking that we

either correct, reverse, or vacate the judgment of conviction allegedly entered in cause

number 9480, Wilbarger County, Texas or dismiss said cause. Furthermore, he believes

himself entitled to same because the trial court “never found [him] guilty of the indictment

9480, in open court . . . .” We deny the petition.

       Mandamus issues to correct error when there is no adequate remedy by law. In re

Nolo Press/Folk Law Inc., 991 S.W.2d 768, 776 (Tex. 1999). Given that he questions the

legitimacy of his final felony conviction, the statutory remedy of habeas corpus is an

avenue available to him. See TEX . CODE CRIM . PROC . ANN . art. 11.07 (Vernon 2002)

(discussing that remedy). Indeed, the document he filed with us indicates that such a
proceeding was filed and apparently pends for disposition.1 Having a legal remedy

available to him, Watson has not satisfied the prerequisites for obtaining a writ of

mandamus. Accordingly, the writ is denied. See Ater v. Eighth Court of Appeals, 802

S.W.2d 241, 243 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991) (holding that since the applicant’s attempt to

vacate his felony conviction could be reviewed through an habeas proceeding initiated

under art. 11.07 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, mandamus could not issue).



                                                                          Brian Quinn

Ordinarily, Rule 44.2(b) requires us to examine error in relation to the entire proceeding and determine whether it had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict. King v. State, 953 S.W.2d 266, 271 (Tex.Crim.App. 1997), citing Kotteakos v. U.S., 328 U.S. 750, 776, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1253, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)(discussing Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure). See also O'Neal v. McAninch, 513 U.S. 432, 437, 115 S.Ct. 992, 995, 130 L.Ed.2d 947 (1995). If the record fails to show that the error had such an impact, it cannot be said to affect a substantial right, and therefore, we are mandated to disregard the error. Examining trial errors, such as the erroneous admission of evidence or improper jury argument, for their probable impact on the jury's verdict is a logical and, for the most part, straightforward process. See e.g., King, 953 S.W.2d at 271 (improper admission of evidence); Ramirez v. State, 976 S.W.2d 219 (Tex.App.-El Paso 1998, pet. ref'd)(improper exclusion of evidence); Umoja v. State, 965 S.W.2d 3, 11 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 1997, no pet.)(non-compliance with Rule 404(b)'s notice provision); Holmes v. State, 962 S.W.2d 663, 675 (Tex.App.-Waco 1998, pet. ref'd untimely filed)(improper jury argument); White v. State, 958 S.W.2d 460, 465 (Tex.App.-Waco 1997, no pet.)(error in exempting witness from "the Rule"). The denial of the right to a jury shuffle, as is true of any jury selection error, does not lend itself to this particular analysis because the impact of the error is not easily related to the jury's verdict. This fact is implicitly recognized in prior decisions which instead inquire whether non-compliance with certain jury selection procedures compromised the fairness of the defendant's trial. See Cooks, 844 S.W.2d at 726-27 (

43
Our examination of the record also convinces us that the destruction of appellant's poster was not done in good faith.  The general order of the day was to destroy all posters "detrimental" or "injurious" to the President.  When Officer Medley first noticed Miss Glasson's poster he determined that it was detrimental to the President, a judgment in which Officer Johnson concurred before ordering its destruction.  When Officer Medley took the poster from Miss Glasson he informed her that the reason for his action was that the poster was "detrimental to the United States," not that she, the President, or any other person was endangered by it.  Both officers testified that only posters favorable to the President were permissible.  Moreover, Officer Johnson unequivocally testified that had this same crowd under the same circumstances been outraged by a poster favorable to the President he would not have ordered its destruction.  Although he later qualified his answer, his testimony still demonstrates that a different standard would have been applied had the crowd been provoked by a poster favorable to the President.  The actions of Officers Medley and Johnson were the result of an official determination not to permit dissent and of their failure to accord to appellant the right to engage in activity protected by the First Amendment.  Also, they failed to recognize her right to be protected from criminal assault and battery.  They testified that they had no obligation to protect appellant, and that had any member of the crowd proceeded against her they would not have arrested the aggressor because in their judgment appellant's poster was "inflammatory."  The actions and attitudes of appellees Medley and Johnson thus bespeak a callous disregard of Miss Glasson's right to express and to advocate peacefully her ideas and exhibit shocking disregard of her right to have her person and property protected by the state from violence at the hands of persons in disagreement with her ideas.  Compare Gregory v. Chicago, supra.


44
Accordingly, we hold that these police officers are required to respond in damages under section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act because they suppressed appellant's peaceful communication of ideas protected by the First Amendment.  When other persons became hostile because of disagreement with the content of her communication, the police officers were not authorized to suppress the offending speech.  They may not defend against a section 1983 action on the ground that her message "could impede the progress of the motorcade and jeopardize the safety of the President, other members of the motorcade and the onlookers in the crowd

OPINION

PER CURIAM:

In this action for coverage under successive general commercial
liability insurance policies, Southeastern Fertility Center, P.A. (South-
eastern) challenges the district court's grant of summary judgment in
favor of Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. (Aetna) on Southeastern's
claims alleging breach of contract and breach of the duty of good faith
and fair dealing with respect to Aetna's obligations under the policies
to provide indemnification and a defense to litigation. Southeastern
also challenges the district court's failure to certify two particular
questions to the South Carolina Supreme Court. We affirm on the rea-
soning of the district court.

The facts in this case are undisputed. In October 1984, Richard
Jablonski (Jablonski) was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Disease. Con-

ski sought treatment from Dr. Grant Patton (Dr. Patton) for the
purpose of storing some of his sperm. In late 1984 and early

 A third stipulation identified by Gilmore and Black, that the claimant concede the accuracy of the shipowner's assertions as to the value of the vessel, has not been widely adopted by the courts of appeals.  See, e.g., In re Two "R" Drilling Co., 943 F.2d 576, 578 (5th Cir.1991) (holding that stipulation is adequate if it concedes that issue of vessel's value will be litigated exclusively before the admiralty court).  However, in light of the appellees' concession that the $70,000 figure accurately represents the value of the Wellcraft, we need not address this issue here


7
 These courts reason that a third party's indemnity or contribution claim is merely derivative of the plaintiff's tort claim.  See Universal Towing, 595 F.2d at 419 ("The third party ... can only recover what the claimant was entitled to recover from the owner, which cannot exceed the owner's statutory limit.")


8
 The best practical illustration of why a co-defendant's contribution claim creates a multiple claimant situation is set forth in Judge Cornelia G. Kennedy's concurring opinion in S & E Shipping:
The [plaintiffs] could win a large judgment against [the shipowner and its co-defendant] jointly in the state court, say $1,000,000.  [The co-defendant] could also win a judgment in state court entitling it to contribution from [the shipowner] for anything it pays the [plaintiffs] in excess of one-half the judgment, or $500,000.  Because of the stipulation they have filed with the District Court, the [plaintiffs] could collect no more from [the shipowner] than the value of the limitation fund as determined by the District Court.  If the fund contains only $250,000 ... then [the co-defendant], jointly and severally liable, would be obligated to pay the [plaintiffs] the unpaid balance of the judgment, or $750,000.  Under its right to contribution [the co-defendant] would be entitled to recover from [the shipowner] any excess over $500,000 dollars that it paid the [plaintiffs], or $250,000.  Since [the co-defendant] did not stipulate that any state court judgment in its favor would not be res judicata on the limitation question, it would then have a $250,000 claim against [the shipowner]

MEMORANDUM OPINION

(Motion to Amend Order Appointing Counsel and for Interim Compensation)
ROGER M. WHELAN, Bankruptcy Judge.
The pending Motion to Amend Order Appointing Counsel and for Interim Compensation *218 was filed by the law firm of Miller, Loewinger and Associates, Chartered, as counsel for the debtor in possession and by such motion they seek to correct a prior order of this Court entered on May 27, 1982, authorizing their retention as attorneys for the debtor in possession in this Chapter 11 case. However, the original Chapter 11 case was initiated by the filing of a petition on October 21, 1981, and the attorneys now seek to have the order of May 27, 1982 entered on a nunc pro tunc basis in order to provide for attorneys' services rendered from the initiation of the case in October 1981. A review of the motion essentially sets forth as a factual predicate for the granting of relief, nunc pro tunc, their "mistaken impression that specific appointment of counsel need not be obtained substantially in advance of the filing of a petition for interim compensation." The record before this Court clearly reflects that no order authorizing retention of counsel was ever signed until May 27, 1982, when attorneys for the debtor in possession then filed their application for retention pursuant to the requirements of Section 327 of the Code.
The facts as presented reflect, with reference to the filed application for interim compensation, that counsel rendered substantial services in the pending Chapter 11 case and yet no steps were admittedly taken to secure court approval for retention of counsel. This is certainly a regrettable situation but the mandate of the Bankruptcy Code is clear in requiring court approval for retention of all "professional persons." 11 U.S.C. § 327 specifically mandates that employment of all professional persons be with "court approval." With reference to the filing of a Chapter 11 case, it is important to bear in mind that a new entity, the debtor in possession, emerges upon the filing of the petition and accordingly retention of attorneys for the debtor in possession is mandated in view of the fact that Section 327 is clearly applicable. See 11 U.S.C. § 1107(a)

V.
Plaintiffs also argue that their claim for equitable relief under 29 U.S.C. 1132(a)(3) is not barred on the substantive grounds asserted by Defendants. This Court concludes, however, that a recent Sixth Circuit decision bars all Plaintiffs' *600 claims under this section. See West v. A.K. Steel Corp., 484 F.3d 395 (6th Cir.2007). These Plaintiffs have already received their benefits and are not in a position to claim injunctive relief, a remedy available only to others who have not "`cashed out' of their participation in the Plan." Id. at 403.
The parties have spent only a few pages arguing `the merits of Plaintiffs' anti-cut-back claims, and as a result the Court concludes that it is not well enough informed on this issue to rule at this time. The pending motions as to that issue are remanded for reconsideration at a later date.
The Court will enter an order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.

ORDER
Defendants have moved to dismiss all Plaintiffs' claims in their entirety based on the statute of limitations, and to dismiss all Plaintiffs' claims (A) arising under 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3) and/or (B) alleging reduction of their accrued benefits by amendments to the Plan, for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.
Having considered all arguments in the accompanying memorandum opinion and being otherwise sufficiently advised,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendants' motions for summary judgment are SUSTAINED IN PART:
(1) All claims of Plaintiffs Robert H. Fallin, Charles Johnson, Claudette Logsdon, Joseph G. Russelburg, Clarence E. Simon, Jr., William M. Gilmore, Eric Clark, and Steve J. Smith are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
(2) The claims of Plaintiff Donald W. Corley arising under 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3) are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendants' motion for summary judgment is DENIED IN PART and Plaintiff Donald W. Corley's claims under 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B) REMAIN.
All other motions are REMANDED at this time. This is NOT a final order.

 Section 405.415(f) reads in part:
(1) General.    Depreciable assets may be disposed of through sale, scrapping, trade-in, exchange, demolition, abandonment, condemnation, fire, theft, or other casualty.  If disposal of a depreciable asset results in a gain or loss, an adjustment is necessary in the provider's allowable cost.  The amount of a gain included in the determination of allowable cost shall be limited to the amount of depreciation previously included in Medicare allowable costs.  The amount of a loss to be included shall be limited to the undepreciated basis of the asset permitted under the program.  The treatment of the gain or loss depends upon the manner of disposition of the asset as specified in paragraphs (f)(2) through (f)(6) of this section.
(2) Bona fide sale or scrapping.    (i) Except as specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, gains and losses realized from the bona fide sale or scrapping of depreciable assets are included in the determination of allowable cost only if the sale or scrapping occurs while the provider is participating in Medicare.  The extent to which such gains and losses are included is calculated by prorating the basis for depreciation of the asset in accordance with the proportion of the assets [sic ] useful life for which the provider participated in Medicare....
....
(3) Sale within 1 year after termination.    Gains and losses realized from a bona fide sale of depreciable assets within 1 year immediately following the date on which the provider terminates participation in the Medicare program are also included in the determination of allowable cost, in accordance with the procedure specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section....

ability to purchase credited service through the Program, we look to the
history of the Pension Clause and the statutory scheme in existence when
the voters passed Proposition 100. See id. at ¶ 21-24.

                      1.     “Public Retirement System Benefit”

¶15            The eleven-year history of the Program prior to the 1998
passage of Proposition 100 confirms that the ability to purchase credited
service through the Program is a public retirement system benefit. The
legislature initially established the Program in 1987 for teachers and
school administrators. 1987 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 182, § 1 (1st Reg. Sess.). 3
In 1994, a legislative amendment to A.R.S. § 38-743 extended eligibility for
the Program to professors and instructors at public universities and
community colleges. See 1994 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 356, § 18 (2d Reg.
Sess.). 4 In 1996, the legislature further expanded the scope of the program


3      Pursuant to the original program,

       A. At the time of retirement a teacher or administrator of a
       school district who is an active member of the plan or system
       and who previously was a member of a public employee
       retirement system in another state while employed as a
       teacher or school administrator and is not receiving
       retirement benefits as a result of that employment may
       receive up to five years of service credit for this prior
       employment if the teacher or administrator pays into the
       system the amount prescribed in subsection B.

       B. A teacher or administrator electing to receive credit for
       service outside this state shall pay to the system the amount
       equal to the increase in the actuarial present value of benefits
       computed at the time of retirement which results from
       adding the number of years or partial years of credited
       service received under subsection A.

1987 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 182, § 1 (1st Reg. Sess.).

4      The 1994 legislation did not affect the five-year cap on prior public
service credit eligible for purchase or the payment at retirement based on
actuarial present value. In 1995, amendments to A.R.S. § 38-743 removed
the requirement that a member’s payment into the program be computed
at the time of retirement and added subsection C to clarify

another trial judge could have found, on the basis of this evidence, Bailey did not have apparent

authority to enter into the contract. However, the trial court’s finding to the contrary in the instant

case is not erroneous. Because the trial court’s judgment can be upheld on the basis of apparent

authority, the judgment must be affirmed. Rosemond, 331 S.W.3d at 767. Norco’s sole issue is

overruled.

                                          Protect’s Appeal

       In its sole issue, Protect asserts the trial court abused its discretion by awarding attorney’s

fees of $3,500 where the evidence presented indicates Protect incurred attorney’s fees and


                                                  13
expenses of $8,924.82, and thus the trial court’s decision lacked factual sufficiency.

        Generally, the amount of money awarded as attorney’s fees rests within the sound

discretion of the court. Ragsdale v. Progressive Voters League, 801 S.W.2d 880, 881 (Tex.

1990). Regarding attorney’s fees, the analysis of whether or not a court abuses its discretion, is

determined by a two-step inquiry: (1) did the trial court have sufficient information upon which

to exercise its discretion; and (2) if so, did the trial court err in exercising that discretion. Alford,

224 S.W.3d at 298. A court abuses its discretion when it acts without reference to guiding rules

and principles, i.e., when it acts in an arbitrary and unreasonable manner. F–Star Socorro, L.P. v.

City of El Paso, 281 S.W.3d 103, 106 (Tex.App.--El Paso 2008, no pet.).

        Protect presented uncontroverted testimony from their counsel, along with supporting

exhibits, reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses incurred by Protect were $8,924.82 and it was

anticipated additional fees of $2,500 for each level of appeal. According to the invoice presented,

the cost of the clean-up was $11,616.34.

        In general, an interested witness’s testimony, though uncontradicted, does no more than

raise a fact issue to be determined by the fact finder. Elias v.

The trial court made, in essence, these material findings: (a) Appellee became the owner of the subject lot two years after the Zoning Code became effective; (b) Appellee's property is located in an area which consists of single and multiple family residences and there are several quiet businesses such as a grocery store etc, which were there before the property was zoned as class R-3, being non-conforming uses; (c) Using appellee's lot for a beauty shop would not devalue the property in the area; (d) But rezoning the property for other types of business (permissible under the C-2 classification) would result in a devaluation of the other property in the area, and; (e) The action of the Planning Commission and the City in refusing to rezone this one *753 lot was arbitrary, unreasonable, and capricious. The court's order was that the lot be rezoned from an R-3 to a C-2 classification, and that the City be enjoined from preventing appellee from using "the property * * * in any manner provided in the C-2 classification". This appeal by City follows.
For a reversal appellant relies on three separate points. One, the court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the Zoning Authorities; Two, there is no proof the City acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or unreasonably, and; Three, there is no proof to justify the trial court in substituting its judgment for that of the City. However, since there is much similarity in the points, we deem it unnecessary to discuss them separately.
The decisive issue before us is whether the testimony justified the trial court in reversing the Zoning Authorities. The fundamental rule by which we must decide this issue has been frequently announced by this Court, and it is clearly stated in the recent case of City of Little Rock v. McKenzie, 239 Ark. 9, 386 S.W.2d 697. In that case the trial court held the City acted arbitrarily in rezoning certain property. In reversing the trial court we used this language:
"In resolving this conflict we cannot substitute our judgment for that of the zoning authorities. We must uphold their decision unless we can say that it is arbitrary and capricious."
Applying the above rule to the testimony in the record here we are unwilling to say the action of the Zoning Authorities was arbitrary or capricious. One definition of the word arbitrary given by Webster is "decisive but unreason

claimed equitable relief in the form of front pay, see Traxler v. Multnomah Cnty.,

596 F.3d 1007, 1011 (9th Cir. 2010), the FMLA does not provide a remedy for an

injury resulting solely from termination for misconduct. See § 2614(a)(3)(B)

(“Nothing in [the FMLA] shall be construed to entitle any restored employee to . . .

any right, benefit, or position of employment other than any right, benefit, or


                                           2
position to which the employee would have been entitled had the employee not

taken the leave.”); 29 C.F.R. § 825.216(a) (“An employee has no greater right to

reinstatement or to other benefits and conditions of employment than if the

employee had been continuously employed during the FMLA leave period.”). In

the district court, Silver did not dispute that Corinthian terminated her employment

solely due to her misconduct, barring any argument to the contrary on appeal. See

United States v. Kitsap Physicians Serv., 314 F.3d 995, 999 (9th Cir. 2002).

       Silver waived any other theories of how Corinthian interfered with her

alleged FMLA rights by failing to raise them in the district court. See Baccei v.

United States, 632 F.3d 1140, 1149 (9th Cir. 2011) (“[W]e will not reframe an

appeal to review what would be in effect a different case than the one decided by

the district court.”).

       Silver’s claim for wrongful termination in violation of the public policy

embodied in the FMLA fails, because she did not allege a causal nexus between

her termination and Corinthian’s failure to notify her of her potential FMLA rights.

See Dep’t of Fair Emp’t & Hous. v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 642 F.3d 728, 749 (9th

Cir. 2011) (citing Turner v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 876 P.2d 1022, 1034 (Cal.

Q And 
what discussion was had with Mr. Duenas about his document?
 
A I 
explained that I would offer to each of them two documents. I turned to Mr. 
Duenas and I said, “This document, the first document, is an affidavit that 
acknowledges your paternity.” And I, knowing that sometimes legalese is 
intimidating for laypersons, I asked, uh — I kind of made sure that they were 
aware in common English what that meant. I said, “By signing this document, 
you’re admitting that you’re the father of these children.” And there’s some 
other reference, statutory information.
 
Q Okay. 
Now, did he say yes, he understood, or no, he didn’t? Or did he acknowledge 
anything?
 
A He 
didn’t really acknowledge either way. He just looked at the document.
 
Q Okay. 
Now, with regards to the Affidavit of Relinquishment of his parental rights, did 
you explain what that document was?
 
A I 
did.
 
Q And 
did he make any response whatsoever to your explanation?
 
A Not at 
all.
 
Q Okay. 
Was there any discussion amongst the people in the room whether he understood or 
whether he should have a translator or anything?
 
A The 
documents that I offered first, the Affidavit of Relinquishment, as we were 
going through the form and I was explaining it to him, and I use the same term 
each time, “By signing this document, you fully, finally, and forever give up 
all parental rights to these children.” As I was going through that, Maria noted 
— she was sitting across from Mr. Duenas. She noted that her name was spelled 
incorrectly on the document.
 
Q Okay. 
So what happened then?
 
A Well, 
at that point she corrected the spelling of her last name. I went back and 
corrected all the documents. And this is after he had signed it, okay.
 
Q So, 
then, he had to resign the documents, is that correct?
 
A That’s 
correct

ORDER ON MOTION FOR ALLOWANCE OF ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE
ALEXANDER L. PASKAY, Chief Judge.
This Chapter 11 case, instituted by William Alton (Debtor), presents a novel question for this Court's consideration. It involves the right of the State of Florida (State) to have an unpaid unemployment claim allowed and charged against the estate of the Debtor as a first priority claim pursuant to Sec. 507(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code. The underlying facts relevant and germane to the claim of the State are without dispute and are as follows:
The Debtor is an individual and was at the time pertinent a general partner of an entity, Madison Hotel Management, Ltd. (Madison Hotel), a limited partnership. In mid-1985, Madison Hotel filed its own voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11. In due course it was authorized to continue to operate its one and only asset, a facility known as the Princess Martha Hotel located in St. Petersburg, Florida. The liability asserted by the State is for the unpaid unemployment tax incurred by Madison Hotel, and based on its failure to pay the appropriate unemployment tax for the fourth quarter of 1985 and the first and second quarters of 1986. The claim of the State is in the amount of $4,090.44. The Debtor, the general partner of Madison Hotel, subsequently filed his own voluntary petition for relief. The Chapter 11 case of the Madison Hotel was ultimately dismissed for its inability to effectuate a plan of organization, but the individual case of the Debtor is still pending.
It is the contention of the State that the Debtor as general partner of the Madison Hotel is legally liable for the debts of Madison Hotel, and since this liability is based on the unpaid unemployment taxes incurred post-petition by Madison Hotel and that of the Debtor, the debt is properly chargeable against the Debtor's estate pursuant to § 503(b)(1)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code and must be accorded administrative claim status pursuant to § 507(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code. Moreover, it is contended by the State that under applicable local law, Sec. 620.71, Fla.Stat., the partnership was automatically dissolved upon the commencement of a bankruptcy case, therefore, the partnership case of Madison Hotel was actually the Debtor's case, and thus he is not only vicariously, but primarily liable for unpaid unemployment taxes incurred originally by Madison Hotel. For this reason the unpaid unemployment taxes should be properly chargeable against his estate as costs

  Before P OSNER, W OOD , and T INDER, Circuit Judges.
  P OSNER, Circuit Judge. The petitioner, Jose Loera, asks
us to set aside his conviction on the ground that his trial
lawyer had been ineffective. See 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Loera
had been indicted back in 2005 on drug charges. In re-
sponse to a motion to suppress, the judge had forbid-
den the government to offer evidence of what the peti-
tioner had told DEA agents after he allegedly asked for
a lawyer. After repeated continuances the judge dis-
2                                              No. 11-3223

missed the indictment (though without prejudice), on
the ground that the delay resulting from the continu-
ances had violated the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3161
et seq. Loera was reindicted and again sought to sup-
press his statements to the agents. But this time the
judge—the same judge—denied the motion on the
ground that actually Loera had not told the DEA agents
he wanted a lawyer. So the statements were admitted
into evidence. The jury convicted Loera and the judge
sentenced him to 240 months in prison. We affirmed
the conviction and sentence. 565 F.3d 406 (7th Cir. 2009).
  Loera faults his lawyer first for having failed to argue
to the district judge that the denial of the motion to sup-
press in the first round of the criminal proceeding
should be binding in the second round—the trial—by
virtue of the doctrine of collateral estoppel; and second
for having failed to argue in that first round that the
delay in the proceeding had violated not only the
Speedy Trial Act but also the

STATEMENT OF THE CASE
The facts of this case are undisputed. Plaintiffs are Miguel A. Aponte and his wife, Belivia S. Aponte. Miguel Aponte was a deputy sheriff for the Wake County Sheriff's Department. Because Aponte could speak Spanish, he was asked to assist the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in the execution of a federal search warrant and a federal arrest warrant. The target of these warrants was to be arrested on federal criminal charges for conspiracy to distribute cocaine and heroin.
The warrants were executed on the morning of December 14, 1994. The raid team consisted of six federal agents and Deputy Sheriff Aponte. Once the team had positioned itself at the apartment specified in the warrants, one federal agent knocked on the door and announced, "Federal Agents! We have a search warrant, open the door!" Aponte repeated the announcement in Spanish. The agents then used a master key to open the door. The door only opened about three inches, where it was caught by a chain. The federal agents again announced the order to open the door; and again Aponte repeated in Spanish. When there was still no response, the agents forced the door and announced, "Police! Police Officers! Search warrant, we're coming in!" Aponte repeated in Spanish.
As the raid team entered the apartment, one federal agent lost his balance and fell forward. When the agent tried to regain his balance, his gun went off. As a result, Deputy Aponte was shot in the foot.
Deputy Aponte retired from the Wake County Sheriff's department as of September 19, 1995. He is entitled to North Carolina Workers Compensation due to the disability arising from the gunshot wound to his foot. Aponte also filed for and was granted Federal Workers Compensation. The Department of Labor determined that Aponte was covered under the Federal Employee's Compensation Act (hereinafter "FECA"), under 5 U.S.C. § 8191; and that Aponte was entitled to the total amount of FECA, which is greater than the North Carolina Workers Compensation. 5 U.S.C. § 8192(a).
Instead of accepting FECA compensation, Aponte has filed suit under the Federal Torts Claims Act (hereinafter "FTCA"). Aponte asks for damages in excess of $1,000,000.00, *900 including medical damages, lost wages/earning capacity, loss of use of part of his body, permanent injury and impairment, pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss

  MCL 769.34(2) provides that “the minimum sentence imposed by a court of this state for a
felony enumerated in part 2 of chapter XVII committed on or after January 1, 1999 shall be
within the appropriate sentence range under the version of those sentencing guidelines in effect
on the date the crime was committed.” (Emphasis added.)

so our review is limited to plain error affecting substantial rights. Id. at 392. To satisfy the
plain-error standard, a defendant must show that “an error occurred, that the error was plain, i.e.,
clear or obvious, and that the plain error affected substantial rights.” Id. at 393. Further, reversal
is only warranted if the error “resulted in the conviction of an actually innocent defendant or
seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.” Id.

        In this case, the trial court assessed 15 points under OV 5 for serious psychological injury
to the victim’s family on the basis of testimony taken after the jury was dismissed. Accordingly,
the court assessed the points on the basis of facts that were not admitted by defendant or found
by the jury. Defendant had a prior record variable (PRV) score of 0, placing her in PRV level A
(0 points), and an OV score of 80, placing her in OV level VI (more than 75 points).
MCL 777.64. Deducting 15 OV points would reduce defendant’s OV score from 80 to 65 and
“change the applicable guidelines minimum sentence range,” Lockridge, 498 Mich at 399, from
29 to 57 months to 19 to 38 months (OV level V—50 to 74 points).

         In Lockridge, 498 Mich at 395, citing Crosby, 397 F3d 117-118, our Supreme Court held
that all defendants “(1) who can demonstrate that their guidelines minimum sentence range was
actually constrained by the violation of the Sixth Amendment and (2) whose sentences were not
subject to an upward departure” are entitled to a remand to determine whether the trial court
committed plain error. Therefore, defendant is entitled to a Crosby remand pursuant to
Lockridge. On remand, the trial court should first give defendant the opportunity to decline
resentencing. Lockridge, 498 Mich at 398.

       We affirm the scoring of OV 5, but order a Crosby remand pursuant to Lockridge

MEMORANDUM-DECISION and ORDER
HURD, District Judge.
I. INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff Corrine Cox ("Cox") brings suit against her former employers, defendants Quick & Reilly, Inc. ("Q & R"), a brokerage *208 and investment firm, and FleetBoston Financial Corporation ("Fleet"), its parent company. She asserts four causes of action against the defendants: (1) Violation of the Equal Pay Act ("EPA"), 29 U.S.C. § 206(d); (2) Discrimination on the basis of sex, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ("Title VII"), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e; (3) Discrimination on the basis of sex, in violation of the New York State Human Rights Law ("NYSHRL"), New York Executive Law § 296(1)(a); and (4) Unlawful retaliation, in violation of the NYSHRL, New York Executive Law § 296(7).
Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56, the defendants, Q & R and Fleet, move for summary judgment on all claims against them. Plaintiff opposes. Oral argument was heard on July 8, 2005, in Utica, New York. Decision was reserved.
II. FACTS
Cox was employed in various capacities by Q & R or their predecessors for approximately 19 years, until her resignation on June 14, 2002. (Docket No. 1, Compl. ś 4) ("Compl.ś ____"). From 1992-95, she served as an Assistant Branch Manager of Fleet's downtown Albany branch office, and from 1995-2000, served as the Branch Manager of that office. Id

The Secretary or his delegate shall, to the extent he deems it practicable, cause officers or employees of the Treasury Department to proceed, from time to time, through each internal revenue district and inquire after and concerning all persons therein who may be liable to pay any internal revenue tax, and all persons owning or having the care and management of any objects with respect to which any tax is imposed.


10
Section 7602 gives the IRS a more specific grant of authority.  By it, the IRS is empowered to examine records and witnesses (secured by summonses, if necessary) for the purpose of determining the correctness of returns and the liability of those who fail to make returns.  In essence, section 7602 gives the IRS the necessary tools to effect the broad mandate of section 7601.  Section 7602 reads as follows:


11
For the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of any return, making a return where none has been made, determining the liability of any person for any internal revenue tax ... or collecting any such liability, the Secretary or his delegate is authorized-


12
(1) To examine any books, papers, records, or other data which may be relevant or material to such inquiry;


13
(2) To summon the person liable for tax or required to perform the act, or any officer or employee of such person, or any person having possession, custody, or care of books of account containing entries relating to the business of the person liable for tax or required to perform the act, or any other person the Secretary or his delegate may deem proper, to appear before the Secretary or his delegate at a time and place named in the summons and to produce such books, papers, records, or other data, and to give such testimony, under oath, as may be relevant or material to such inquiry; and


14
(3) To take such testimony of the person concerned, under oath, as may be relevant or material to such inquiry.  (Italics ours.)

Taxpayers Compliance Measurement Program

15
The enforceability of an IRS summons pursuant to a TCMP audit was the subject of a recent opinion in United States v. Flagg, 634 F.2d 1087 (8th Cir.  1980). There the court gave the following description of the TCMP:


16
The Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program is designed to measure and evaluate how taxpayers comply with the Internal Revenue Code reporting requirements.

 That the Supreme Court does not extend this rule to instructions on included offenses, at least of the character involved here, seems clear from the following language found in People v. Chessman, 38 Cal.2d 166, 187-188 [238 P.2d 1001]:
 "As to crime (2), grand theft of an automobile, there is ample evidence ... to show that he intended to steal it. But, defendant says, the evidence would also permit the inference that he took the car with intent merely to deprive the owner of possession temporarily; i. e., the lesser offense of violation of section 503 of the Vehicle Code; and the jury should have been so instructed. ... If defendant wished to raise this contention, he should have requested an instruction as to the lesser offense and argued the matter to the jury." Here appellant neither requested the instruction nor argued the matter to the jury. In this respect his case is on all fours with that of Chessman. See also People v. Johnson, 99 Cal.App.2d 717, 727 [222 P.2d 335]; People v. Zabel, 95 Cal.App.2d 486, 489 [213 P.2d 60]; People v. Arguilida, 85 Cal.App.2d 623, 625 [193 P.2d 478]; People v. Dunlop, 79 Cal.App.2d 207, 211 [179 P.2d 658].
 [3] Appellant's last contention is that the district attorney was guilty of prejudicial misconduct in commenting in his opening and closing arguments to the jury on appellant's failure to testify. No objection was made to these comments on the trial of the action. No motions were made to strike these remarks from the record or to instruct the jury to disregard them. It would seem that appellant is thus in no position to complain about them on appeal. (People v. Perry, 14 Cal.2d 387, 396 [94 P.2d 559, 124 A.L.R. 1223]; People v. Sykes, 44 Cal.2d 166, 172-173 [280 P.2d 769].) *854 An examination of the comments satisfies us, as well, that in view of California Constitution, article I, section 13 and Penal Code, section 1323, they were not improper. (People v. Adamson, 27 Cal.2d 478, 486-490 [165 P.2d 3].) The trial court correctly instructed

In 1982, defendant was found guilty of theft, a third degree felony, in violation of U.C.A., 1953, § 76-6-404. He appealed and argued, inter alia, that the trial court erroneously permitted part of a written deposition to be taken into the jury room. In State v. Davis, 689 P.2d 5 (Utah 1984), this Court affirmed the conviction and ruled that defendant was precluded from asserting the error on appeal in view of his failure to make a seasonable objection at trial.
After defendant's petition for rehearing was denied by this Court and the case was remitted to the district court, defendant filed an amended motion for a new trial based on the jury's access to the written deposition. The trial court denied this motion on the ground that it was not timely. Defendant appeals this ruling, alleging that he has now made a proper challenge to the error in district court. For the same reason that the issue was deemed waived on direct appeal (i.e., failure to make a proper and seasonable objection), the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a new trial.
Defendant also requests that the sentencing orders be declared invalid and that the case be remanded for resentencing. However questionable the procedures employed in entering the formal order of sentence, the matter is now moot since defendant has served his sentence and has received a formal termination of probation. As stated in Spain v. Stewart, 639 P.2d 166, 168 (Utah 1981), "Where the requested judicial relief can no longer affect the rights of the litigants, the case is moot and a court will normally refrain from adjudicating it on the merits." The exception alluded to is where there is a continuing and recurring controversy but, because of the short time period for adjudication, appellate review of the issue is effectively denied. Wickham v. Fisher, 629 P.2d 896 (Utah 1981). That is not the situation in the instant case. Since all questions raised as to sentencing orders are now moot, we will not address the merits of defendant's arguments.
*896 As a separate point on appeal, defendant contends that the court's order of restitution was invalid due to irregularities before and during the restitution hearing. The record contains no formal order of restitution. The only record of that proceeding is an unsigned minute entry which is not appealable. South Salt Lake v. Burton, 33 Utah Adv.Rep. 27 (1986).
The issues raised in defendant's amended motion for a

On November 24, 1981, Carl Nance, born February 10, 1948, applied for disability benefits alleging a back injury as his disability.  After the Secretary denied benefits, Nance sought reconsideration on March 17, 1982, and such was denied on April 9, 1982.  Nance indicated that he does household chores, runs the vacuum, drives and has no problem socializing.  From 1977 to 1981, Nance worked as a warehouseman, forklift operator, and sweeper for Cooper Energy Services.  Nance requested a hearing, noting that "omly nervous condition is much worse.  I am very short tempered and the pain and discomfort is worse in my back, legs and I have severe headaches."    A hearing was held on August 17, 1982.

Nance testified that he weighed 185 pounds and had completed a six-week welding training school.  Nance last worked at Cooper Energy on May 10, 1981, where he generally lifted 10 to 50 pounds.  The ALJ found that this was light to heavy work.  Nance testified that he can go shopping, to church, and can walk and stand, but cannot kneel or bend over without pain.  Nance can lift 10 to 15 pounds and can walk 35 to 40 feet before his legs and back start hurting.  Nance can stand or sit for 15 to 20 minutes at a time.

Nance testified that he had missed a lot of work due to his back problem and depression and that he had severe pain in his lower back, spine, neck, shoulders, and arms.  Nance indicated that he did not seek psychiatric or psychological care because he "[d]idn't think I was that bad off."    Nance planned to enter a hospital for treatment of an emotional disorder.

Evidence in the record reveals that on June 3, 1980, Nance was admitted to the hospital after a motorcycle accident but x-rays showed no fractures.  Examination by Nance's treating physician, Dr. Pavlatos

*58 Mr. Harry Peyton, with whom Mr. William H. Robeson and Mr. George E. Wallace were on the brief, for defendant in error.
*57 MR. JUSTICE DAY delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a writ of error to the Court of Civil Appeals for the *59 Fourth Supreme Judicial District of the State of Texas. The defendant in error, George A. Sowers, a citizen of Arizona, recovered judgment in the District Court of El Paso County, Texas, in the sum of $5,000, for personal injuries alleged to have been sustained by him while employed in the service of the plaintiff in error as a brakeman in the Territory of New Mexico. The judgment was affirmed by the Court of Civil Appeals. 99 S.W.Rep. 190. Subsequently leave to file a petition in error was denied by the Supreme Court of Texas, and the case was brought here by writ of error to the Court of Civil Appeals.
The defendant in error recovered because of injuries received while riding on the pilot of an engine at Gallup, New Mexico. His injuries are alleged to have been occasioned by the negligence of the railroad company in permitting its track to become soft and out of repair, permitting low joints therein, by reason of which the engine's pilot struck a frog and guard rail, and the plaintiff was injured.
We are not concerned with the questions of general law in actions of negligence which were involved in the case. The Federal question which invites our attention concerns an act of the legislature of New Mexico, passed March 11, 1903 (chapter 33, page 51, Acts of 35th Legislative Assembly of New Mexico). We give this act in full in the margin.[1]
*60 It is contended by the plaintiff in error that its effect is to prescribe causes of action for personal injuries, enforceable only in *61 the District Court of the Territory of New Mexico, and not elsewhere, and that the court of Texas, in maintaining jurisdiction of *62 the case, and refusing to enforce the territorial statute, denied a Federal right guaranteed by the Constitution and statutes of the United States, requiring such faith and credit to be given in every court within the United States to the public acts, records and judicial proceedings of every other State or Territory as they have, by law, in the courts of the State or Territory from which they are taken.
It is contended that there is no jurisdiction in this court to entertain this writ of error. But we are of opinion that

PER CURIAM:

                Kerry Lee Wagaman appeals the district court’s order that

granted summary judgment in favor of his former employer in his

civil     action     in     which   he      alleged    violations       of    the   Age

Discrimination in Employment Act and the Rehabilitation Act and

retaliation.        For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.

                Summary judgment is appropriate only if, viewing the

evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, there

are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute and the moving

party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.                        Anderson v.

Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986).                   We have thoroughly

reviewed the briefs and joint appendix, including the transcript of

the   summary      judgment      hearing,    and    find   no    reversible    error.*

Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated on the record by the

district court.          See Wagaman v. England, No. 8:05-cv-02258-PJM (D.

Md. May 17, 2006).            We dispense with oral argument because the

facts     and    legal    contentions    are       adequately     presented    in   the

materials       before     the   court   and     argument       would   not   aid   the

decisional process.

                                                                              AFFIRMED

MEMORANDUM OF DECISION
CHARLES J. MARRO, Bankruptcy Judge, Sitting by Special Designation.
This Court has jurisdiction of this proceeding under 28 U.S.C. § 157 and 28 U.S.C. § 1334(d) as well as the General Order of Reference of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida.
This Memorandum of Decision constitutes findings of fact and conclusions of law under F.R.Civ.P. 52 as made applicable by Rule 7052 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure.
The Plaintiff by its complaint seeks declaratory and Injunctive Relief regarding its right to continue to use a sewer line and lift station constructed by the Debtor-Defendant which provides sewage disposal for a Shopping Center now owned by the Plaintiff through foreclosure of a mortgage.
An evidentiary hearing was held and as part thereof the parties have agreed to certain proposed findings. Based on the evidence and the proposed findings submitted by agreement the Court makes the following determinations:

FINDINGS OF FACT
By deed dated August 5, 1983 the defendant, Michael Bende, an individual trading as Michael Properties, acquired from New Plan Realty Trust certain tracts or parcels of land and premises situated in the Township of Old Bridge, County of Middlesex, State of New Jersey, known as Lots 9-A, 13 and 14 as shown on the Tax Map of the Township of Old Bridge.
After the acquisition of said property Bende improved it by constructing a

Like the instant case, Dowhower is assigned to District II of the court of appeals. We are issuing our opinion in Dowhower simultaneously with our opinion in this case. The Gohde and Van Erden cases are assigned to other districts of the court of appeals, and those courts have not as yet issued opinions in those cases. The issue in this case and Dowhower is also raised in other cases currently pending in the court of appeals.
[3]  "Split limits" confers separate coverage "per person" and "per occurrence." See Folkman, 264 Wis. 2d 617, ¶ 6. "Single limits" coverage does not make such a distinction.
[4]  WISCONSIN STAT. § 632.32(5)(i) (2001-02) grants insurers the right to reduce their limits of liability by the sums paid by or on behalf of the tortfeasor. The parties do not dispute that the reducing clause in the Commercial policy conforms to the strictures of this statute. Rather, the dispute is whether the location and language of the reducing clause renders the Commercial policy contextually ambiguous and therefore unenforceable.

All references to the Wisconsin Statutes are to the 2001-02 version.
[5]  The Folkmans also sued the other driver and his insurer.
[6]  The Folkmans' theory of multiple liability was based on the following reasoning:

a. the driver son, as the operator of the vehicle, was liable to Debra and her other son, as passengers of the vehicle, producing a claim of $50,000 ($25,000 for each insured);
b. Debra was liable to the passenger son as the co-sponsor of the driver son's license, producing a claim of $25,000;
c. the father was liable to both Debra and the passenger son as the co-sponsor of the driver son's license, producing a claim of $50,000 ($25,000 for each insured).
See Folkman, 264 Wis. 2d 617, 11 9.
[7]  In fact, the record in this case does not reveal whether the Vorbecks had read the Commercial policy.
[8]  We assume the "Quick Reference" index does not reference the Wisconsin Endorsement because the policy, including the index, is a generic policy intended for use in all jurisdictions. As such, the index does not reflect any endorsements unique

seeking an order from the trial court compelling arbitration, delay alone generally does not

establish waiver. See In re Vesta Ins. Group, 192 S.W.3d at 763. The record shows a period of

approximately one year between the time Pilot Travel answered the lawsuit and the time it filed

its motion to compel arbitration. Greater delays in moving to compel arbitration have been

insufficient to constitute waiver of arbitration rights. See, e.g., id. (litigating for two years in trial

court insufficient to overcome presumption against waiver). We must consider this delay in the

context of other factors affecting the litigation process. Small, 310 S.W.3d at 639.

        We note there was no evidentiary hearing and no reporter’s record of argument before the

trial court concerning Pilot Travel’s motion to compel arbitration. The trial court made no

findings pertinent to the merits of Pilot Travel’s motion to compel arbitration. Appellees do not

cite to evidence purportedly presented to the trial court, nor can appellees cite to any evidence in

the record, that demonstrates Pilot Travel substantially invoked the judicial process. See Small,

310 S.W.3d at 645–46, 649 (record did not support argument that movants had waived their right

to arbitration by invoking the judicial process to the prejudice of nonmovant; record contained no

reporter’s record of argument before the trial court, no evidentiary hearing regarding the motion

to compel arbitration, and no trial court findings).

                                                  –20–
           The quantum of litigation conduct that will be deemed “substantial” depends very much

on the context. See Perry Homes, 258 S.W.3d at 593; EZ Pawn Corp. v. Mancias, 934 S.W.2d

87, 89–90 (Tex. 1996) (per curiam) (party did not waive arbitration right by answering the suit,

participating in docket control conference, propounding requests for production and

interrogatories, noticing plaintiff’s deposition, and entering into an agreed order to reset the

original trial date); Walker v. J.C. Bradford & Co., 938 F.2d 575, 576–78 (5th Cir. 1991) (party

did not waive arbitration right by propounding interrogatories and requests for production

I MOTION TO DISMISS

Under Rule 12(b)(6), in determining whether a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, this Court must accept as true the plaintiff's allegations contained in the complaint and view them in a light most favorable to the plaintiff. Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 1686, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974); Wileman Bros. & Elliott, Inc. v. Giannini, 909 F.2d 332, 334 (9th Cir.1990); Shah v. County of Los Angeles, 797 F.2d 743, 745 (9th Cir. 1986). Thus, the complaint must stand unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff has alleged no facts that would entitle him to relief. Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 101-02, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957); Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dept., 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1988). A complaint may be dismissed as a matter of law for two reasons: (1) lack of a cognizable legal theory or (2) insufficient facts under a cognizable legal theory. Balistreri, 901 F.2d at 699; Robertson v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 749 F.2d 530, 533-34 (9th Cir.1984).
In essence, as the Ninth Circuit has stated, "[t]he issue is not whether a plaintiff's success on the merits is likely but rather whether the claimant is entitled to proceed beyond the threshold in attempting to establish his claims." De La Cruz v. Tormey, 582 F.2d 45, 48 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 965, 99 S.Ct. 2416, 60 L.Ed.2d 1072 (1979). The Court must determine whether or not it appears to a certainty under existing law that no relief can be granted under any set of facts that might be proved in support of plaintiffs' claims. Id.
A motion under Rule 12(b)(6) should also be granted if an affirmative defense or other bar to relief is apparent from the face of the Complaint, such as lack of jurisdiction or the

On August 19, 1980, the Weissers signed loan settlement statements indicating advances (other than appraisal fee, legal fee, service charge, abstracting, and interest) on one duplex of $52,158.87 and on the other duplex of $52,204.31. The loan settlement statements contained the following language immediately above the Weissers' signatures:
"The undersigned acknowledges the receipt of this Loan Settlement Statement, and agrees to the correctness thereof, and authorizes and ratifies the disbursement of the funds as stated therein."
In its conclusions of law, the trial court determined:
"3. The loan settlement statements signed by the plaintiffs did not absolve Grand Forks Federal from liability to the plaintiffs as the statements were signed after the damage was incurred and after there was nothing the plaintiffs could do about it."
The Weissers assert that the ratifications were ineffective because they did not have full knowledge of what had happened; neither the loan settlement statements nor the letters furnished the Weissers explained how the disbursements were made; the damage was already done and appeared irreparable, suggesting an absence of consideration; the loan settlement statements were signed due to an inducementrefinancingoffered by Grand Forks Federal; and Grand Forks Federal had a fiduciary duty to the Weissers.
While we do not agree with Weissers' assertion that there was no consideration for the ratification, as additional funds

petition to revoke, the State introduced a copy of a laboratory report. Appellant objected to

the admission of the report, arguing that, because the analyst who prepared the report was not

present to testify, admission of the report would violate his rights under the Confrontation

Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The trial court overruled

the objection, and the report was admitted into evidence.

       At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court found that appellant violated the terms

of his suspended sentence by possessing drugs and drug paraphernalia and revoked his

suspended sentence. Appellant was sentenced to a total of 240 months’ imprisonment.1 This

timely appeal followed.

       On appeal of a revocation, our review is directed toward determining whether the trial

court’s findings are clearly against the preponderance of the evidence. Patrick v. State, 2010

Ark. App. 541. In order to revoke the terms of probation, the State must prove by a

preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of his probation. Id.

       Appellant does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support his revocation.

Instead, he argues that the trial court violated his constitutional right to confront witnesses



       1
       The sentencing order mistakenly states that appellant was placed on suspension or
probation and that the circuit court retained jurisdiction during the period of suspension
or probation. The order as a whole makes it clear that appellant was sentenced to a term
of imprisonment with no suspension or probation.

against him when it allowed a copy of a laboratory report into evidence when the analyst who

prepared the report did not testify at the hearing.

       In support of his argument, appellant cites Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U.S. 305

(2009), in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the admission of a lab

report without the testimony of the person who created the report violated a defendant’s

rights under the Confrontation Clause. The right to confront witnesses does apply to

revocation proceedings. Goforth v. State, 27 Ark. App. 150, 767 S.W.2d 537 (1989).

However, a defendant shall give at least ten days’ notice prior to the proceedings that he or

she requests

his pro se lawsuit against former counsel whom he alleges

breached his contract, defrauded him of fees paid, and acted

negligently in failing to represent him in postconviction

proceedings.   Both Chapa and Duncan are residents of Texas;

consequently, diversity jurisdiction does not exist.        See 28

U.S.C. § 1332; Getty Oil Corp. v. Insurance Co. of N. Am., 841

F.2d 1254, 1258-59 (5th Cir. 1988).

     Chapa now argues that federal-question jurisdiction exists,

pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, because his claims against his

attorney are related to a federal criminal conviction.   This

argument is specious; he has filed a lawsuit alleging claims of

fraud, breach of contract, and negligence, none of which, on

their face, implicates a federal right sufficiently to invoke

§ 1331, irrespective of the nature of his criminal conviction.

     Chapa additionally argues that jurisdiction is somehow

grounded upon Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 55 and 60.    These

rules, dealing with judgments and relief therefrom, have nothing

to do with jurisdiction.    See Fed. R. Civ. P. 55 and 60.

     Chapa renews his argument that jurisdiction existed under

§ 1331 because his attorney’s fraud had the effect of suspending

his habeas relief, in violation of the Suspension Clause, since

the limitations period for pursuing postconviction relief has

expired in his case.   Even if it is assumed that Chapa may raise

a Suspension Clause claim in a civil action against his attorney,

his postconviction relief procedure is under 28 U.S.C. § 2255,

the limitations period of which is not constrained by the

Suspension Clause because a § 2255 motion is not a habeas corpus

action.   See Turner v. Johnson, 177 F.3

The background facts are set forth in the magistrate judge's report and recommendation and will not be repeated here.  Suffice it to say that the Grays filed this action alleging that Home Bank violated the disclosure requirements of TILA and Regulation Z.  Additionally, the Grays alleged that Home Bank failed to make new disclosures regarding the refinancing of certain transactions, failed to disclose to the Grays the right to rescission along with a separate notice of the right to rescind, wrongly retained the Grays' credit balances, failed to accurately disclose the financing terms, and engaged in fraudulent concealment.  The Grays sought actual damages, statutory damages and costs.  They also sought damages as a result of Home Bank allegedly causing them emotional distress, humiliation, harm to their reputation, and for other tort and fraud claims.


4
Home Bank filed a motion pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b), arguing that the Grays' complaint was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.  The magistrate judge issued a report recommending that the complaint be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  Despite objections filed by the Grays, the district court adopted the report and recommendation and entered an order accordingly.


5
This court renders de novo review of judgments dismissing cases for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  Willis v. Sullivan, 931 F.2d 390, 395 (6th Cir.1991).  Upon review, we conclude that the district court correctly dismissed the complaint as time-barred.  The governing statute provides:  "Any action under this section may be brought in any United States district court, or in any other court of competent jurisdiction, within one year from the date of the occurrence of the violation."  15 U.S.C. Sec. 1640(e).  The limitations period in Sec. 1640(e) runs from the date of consummation of the transaction, but the doctrine of equitable tolling may, in the appropriate circumstances, suspend the limitations period until the borrower discovers or has reasonable opportunity to discover the fraud or nondisclosures that form the basis of the TILA action.  See Jones v. TransOhio Sav. Ass'n, 747 F.2d 1037, 1041 (6th Cir.1984).

The Grays argue that they were not aware of the TILA violations until March 1993 due to continuous concealment of documents, reports, and numerous delaying

MEMORANDUM OPINION
WEINER, District Judge.

These admiralty actions arise out of a collision which occurred during the early morning hours of January 31, 1975, on the Delaware River at Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania. The vessels involved were the SS Edgar M. Queeny ("Queeny"), an American steamship, and the S.T. Corinthos ("Corinthos"), a Liberian steam tanker. At the time of the collision, the Corinthos was moored, starboard side, to the BP Oil Inc./Sohio Petroleum Company dock at Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania in order to discharge her cargo of crude oil. The collision and the resulting explosions caused extensive damage to the dock, the destruction of the Corinthos, oil pollution of the Delaware River, minor damage to the Queeny, damage to neighboring properties, and tragic loss of 26 lives and other personal injuries.
As a result of this incident, numerous proceedings were instituted. The personal injury and wrongful death actions were settled and dismissed, and therefore shall not be discussed in this opinion. A products liability action was filed by BP Oil Inc. and Sohio Petroleum Company against Bethlehem Steel Corporation, General Electric Company and The William Powell Company (See C.A. 77-2362). These defendants, collectively referred to as the products or third party defendants, participated in one aspect or another in the design and construction of the Queeny, her turbine set and controls, and the astern guardian valve. At the time of trial, the products liability action was severed and stayed pending the resolution of the limitation actions.[1] Also severed at the time of trial was the action of BP Oil, Inc./Sohio Petroleum Company against Villaneuva *339 Compania Naviera, S.A., et al., owner of the Corinthos (See C.A. No. 75-1285).
In the instant limitation actions, the issue of damages was bifurcated from the issue of liability, and the cases then proceeded to trial before the court sitting without a jury. On the second day of trial, James F. Young, Esquire, attorney for the Queeny interests admitted that his client no longer sought exoneration. (N.T. Pgs. 38-39, July 19, 1979). Accordingly, our opinion will address the questions of whether the Queeny interests are entitled to limit their liability and whether the Corinthos and BP Ohio Inc./Sohio Petroleum Company interests can be

Arthur L. BAILEY, Jr.,
v.
CITY OF SOUTH PORTLAND and John L. Murphy.
Supreme Judicial Court of Maine.
Submitted on Briefs November 24, 1997.
Decided March 13, 1998.
*392 Michael H. Hill, Monaghan, Leahy, Hochadel & Libby, Portland, for plaintiff.
Mary K. Kahl, Corporation Counsel, South Portland, for defendant.
Thomas F. Jewell, Jewell & Boutin, Portland, for Murphy.
Before WATHEN, C.J., and ROBERTS, CLIFFORD, RUDMAN, and DANA, JJ.
DANA, Justice.
[¶ 1] Arthur L. Bailey appeals from the judgment entered in the Superior Court (Cumberland County, Calkins, J.) affirming the South Portland Zoning Board of Appeals' grant of a variance sought by John L. Murphy. The issue before us is whether Murphy's property should be considered one lot or three lots, two of which cannot yield a reasonable return without a variance. We conclude that Murphy owns three lots and that the Board's decision to grant Murphy a variance based on undue hardship is supported by substantial evidence in the record. We thus affirm the judgment.
[¶ 2] In 1985, Murphy purchased from Alice and Thomas Carmody three "lots of record" in the Willard Beach area of South Portland described in a single deed by its metes and bounds.[1] A single family residence is situated on one of the lots, identified on South Portland's tax map 2 as lot 1 (hereinafter the "house lot"). The remainder of the property (identified on South Portland's tax map 1 as lots 233 and 237A) (hereinafter lots A and B) is otherwise unimproved.
[¶ 3] South Portland's zoning regulations for this area require a minimum lot size of 12,500 square feet and at least 75 feet of road frontage. The house lot meets the road frontage requirement but is only 8,976 square feet in size.[2] Lots A and B have a combined size of about 14,000 square feet but only 26 feet of road frontage. The current *393 zoning requirements existed at the time Murphy acquired these lots.
[¶ 4] The Zoning Board of Appeals for the City of South Portland granted a variance to Murphy from South Portland's street frontage requirement enabling him to construct a single-family

Mrs. Walker testified that after informing Dollie Smith and Addie Lewis of her injury, she then reported it that afternoon to (1) Fred Jordan, manufacturing supervisor for defendant, (2) George Fowler, supervisor of one shift, (3) Terry Copeland, personnel manager, (4) Glenn Poole, plant manager, and (5) Charliea Sandifer, a general worker at the plant. All of those witnesses, except Sandifer, were called by plaintiff.
Jordan, Copeland and Poole testified that plaintiff never reported the accident to them, and that they did not know anything about the alleged accident or injury until this suit was filed. Fowler stated that plaintiff called him over to her table one day and told him that she had hurt her knee, but that she continued to work "the rest of the week." He thought she was joking, but he nevertheless told her to see a doctor if she was hurt. He said that nothing more was said or done about such a complaint after that time. He also stated that plaintiff complained about her knees almost daily while she worked for defendant.
Plaintiff testified that she told another co-worker, Charliea Sandifer, that she had injured her knee immediately after the alleged accident occurred, that she showed the witness her knee and asked her to find George Fowler, that Mrs. Sandifer commented on the swelling of the knee, urged plaintiff to have it attended to, and then left to look for Fowler. Mrs. Sandifer was the only witness called by defendant. She firmly denied that plaintiff ever mentioned to her that she had struck or hurt her knee. She stated that plaintiff had complained about her knee on prior occasions, and particularly in December, 1974, and in January, 1975, and that plaintiff explained at the times of those complaints that "she had fell at the other plant and had hurt her knee and that it gives her trouble from time to time."
The plaintiff in a workmen's compensation suit, as in any other case, must prove his claim by a preponderance of the evidence. Schwab v. Fidelity and Casualty Company of New York, 294 So.2d 888 (La.App. 2 Cir. 1974); Guillory v. New Amsterdam Casualty Company, 244 La. 225, 152 So.2d 1 (1963); Roberts v. M. S. Carroll Co., 68 So.2d 689 (La.App. 2 Cir. 1953); Morrison v. East Baton Rouge Parish School Board, 316 So.2

¶ 14. The Court of Appeals found that the proof only supported the crime of "heat of passion" manslaughter and remanded for re-sentencing. The Court of Appeals supports its decision for remand for re-sentencing for manslaughter with Harrell v. State, 218 So.2d 883 (Miss.1969). Harrell is a case with facts which are stronger in support of a self-defense or "imperfect self-defense" theory. There, Harrell killed an intruder who was first ejected from her home and later returned evidencing aggressive intent. There was a factual dispute as to whether the intruder had actually entered the house or was in the doorway and whether or not he was wielding a knife. The Court acknowledged that the evidence was sufficient to withstand a motion for a directed verdict of not guilty, but that "the ends of justice will better be served by a remand of the case for a new trial." Harrell does not support a remand with directions to find guilt on manslaughter only. Rather, it simply remands for another trial on guilt and degree.
As we have said, the present case is close upon the facts as to the guilt or innocence of the accused. After carefully reviewing the whole record, we have concluded that while the evidence was sufficient to withstand appellant's motion that the jury be instructed peremptorily to return a verdict of not guilty, the conviction should be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial in order that another jury may pass upon appellant's guilt or innocence of unlawful homicide, and upon the grade of her offense, if found guilty.
Harrell at 886-87. This language mandates a new trial where the possibility of guilt still exists for both the principal and the lesser-included offense, unlike the present case where the Court of Appeals held, as a matter of law, that Wade was not guilty of murder but rather was guilty of manslaughter. The real importance of the reliance upon Harrell by the Court of Appeals is found in that court's quote as follows:
A person may be guilty only of manslaughter or justifiable homicide when slaying another even though the accused is mad and is bearing ill will toward his adversary at the time of the killing, if *776 the act is done while resisting an attempt of the latter "to do any unlawful act, or after such attempt shall have failed," if such anger or ill will is engendered by the particular circumstances of the unlawful act then being attempted, or the commission of which is then thwarted,

Mr. Justice Wesley Castles delivered the Opinion of the Court.

    This is an appeal from a declaratory judgment entered for
plaintiff in the district court of the first judicial district,
county of Lewis and Clark.
    Plaintiff is Jersey Creamery, Inc., a corporation, doing
business as a dairy. Defendant is the Board of Milk Control,
an administrative agency of the state of Montana.   Hereinafter
plaintiff will be called "~ersey"and defendant "~oard".
    Jersey operates what are known as "Quality Chekd" dairies,
and is a member of the Quality Chekd Dairy Products Association.
Jersey proposed a scholarship contest whereby the fact of the
contest would be advertised on its milk cartons and through
other advertising media throughout the state. Applicants for
the scholarship were not required to purchase anything from
Jersey, but merely to complete an application blank.    These
blanks were found on the cartons, but any applicant could make
his own application form, as long as it contained the necessary
information. These applications were then to be given to an
independent agency to pick the winners by a drawing, All
applications except those of non-residents of the state or
employees of Jersey were eligible to win the contest. There was
no necessity for the purchase of any of Jersey's merchandise
to be eligible to win.   Winners of the contest received funds
to be applied toward a college education, the funds to be paid
directly to the college of the winner's choice.
    Jersey informed the Board of its proposed scholarship
contest as part of a national "Quality Chekd" program, The
Board informed Jersey this contest would violate the Montana
Milk Control Act and that the contest was prohibited.   Jersey
then appealed to the full Board, thereby exhausting its adminis-
trative remedies.
    The final ruling of the Board was that the scholarship
contest violated specific sections of the Milk Control Act and
regulations

Before SCHWAB, C.J., and RICHARDSON and ROBERTS, JJ.
ROBERTS, Judge.
Defendant appeals from his conviction of furnishing liquor to a minor, a Class A misdemeanor. Two assignments of error are made. First, it is claimed that defendant was deprived of his right to a jury trial. Our disposition of this case makes it unnecessary to discuss the facts or the second assignment of error.
After defendant was arrested and charged with the crime, his attorney made a written request for a jury trial as provided by Jackson County District Court Rule 5.6.[1] However, defense counsel did not appear at pretrial conference. Rule 5.13 of Jackson County District Court Rules provides that failure to attend a pretrial conference is a *1022 waiver of a jury trial.[2] On the day set for trial no jury was present. Defendant proceeded to trial before the judge. No mention was made of a jury by either the state or defense. The record is silent on the matter.
The right to a jury trial in "criminal prosecutions" is guaranteed by the Oregon Constitution.
"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have the right to public trial by an impartial jury in the county in which the offense shall have been committed; * * * provided, however, that any accused person, in other than capital cases, and with the consent of the trial judge, may elect to waive trial by jury and consent to be tried by the judge of the court alone, such election to be in writing; * * *" Or.Const., Art. I, § 11. (Emphasis supplied.)
The Oregon statutes also require that a waiver of a jury trial in criminal cases be in writing.[3]
The state argues that the failure to execute written waiver of a jury trial is harmless error absent a showing of actual prejudice, citing State v. Naughten, 5 Or. App. 6, 8, 480 P.2d 448, Sup.Ct. review denied (1971). That

UDALL, Justice.
The petitioner, Jose B. Davila, herein referred to as employee, is before this Court on a writ of certiorari to review an award of the Industrial Commission granted as a result of injuries received while in the employ of San Manuel Copper Corporation, herein referred to as employer.
This case involves two separate and distinct claim files of the Industrial Commission. The first case involves injury to employee's right arm which occurred on May 15, 1960. The second case involves an injury to employee's fingers on his left hand which occurred on August 3, 1961.
On the date of the first injury the employee was taken to San Manuel Hospital for treatment. The medical report reveals there was swelling in employee's right wrist and stiffness of a finger on his right hand. Employee resumed light work the following day.
Dr. Findlay, chief surgeon at the hospital, referred the case to Dr. Fonseca for evaluation. Dr. Fonseca found there were no neurological problems but found some indication of hysteria. On July 12, 1960, Dr. Neumann examined employee and concluded that he had no neurological deficit but advised further exercises to strengthen employee's right hand. On August 30, 1960 employee was examined by Dr. Hastings and Dr. Findlay. They were of the opinion there was no evidence of any residual disability from the injury and that employee represented a combination of actual malingering and hysteria. They found that employee could return to regular work.
*260 Employee filed his claim with the Commission on September 22, 1960. Dr. Findlay discharged employee from further medical treatment on November 3, 1960, without disability, and on November 15, 1960 the Commission entered its Findings and Award, closing the claim and specifically finding there was no permanent disability.
Employee timely filed his protest on December 5, 1960 with the allegation that within twenty days from that date he would make application for a rehearing. The petition for rehearing was filed on December 28, 1960, more than twenty days after the filing of the notice of protest.
The Commission treated the late petition for rehearing as a petition for reopening, and by an interim order authorized a medical examination of employee without reopening the case. Employee was examined on April 10, 1961, by Drs. Hastings, Wells, Neumann, Findlay and Fon

"(A) In his representation of a client, a lawyer shall not:
....
"(4) Knowingly use perjured testimony or false evidence.
....
"(6) Participate in the creation or preservation of evidence when he knows or it is obvious that the evidence is false.
"(7) Counsel or assist his client in conduct that the lawyer knows to be illegal or fraudulent."
The Standards Relating to the Defense Function, adopted by the American Bar Association, Approved Draft, 1971, discusses *56 the situation with which trial counsel was faced in this case. The pertinent standard reads:
"7.7 Testimony by the defendant.
"(a) If the defendant has admitted to his lawyer facts which establish guilt and the lawyer's independent investigation establishes that the admissions are true but the defendant insists on his right to trial, the lawyer must advise his client against taking the witness stand to testify falsely.
"(b) If, before trial, the defendant insists that he will take the stand to testify falsely, the lawyer must withdraw from the case, if that is feasible, seeking leave of the court if necessary.
"(c) If withdrawal from the case is not feasible or is not permitted by the court, or if the situation arises during the trial and the defendant insists upon testifying falsely in his own behalf, it is unprofessional conduct for the lawyer to lend his aid to the perjury or use the perjured testimony. Before the defendant takes the stand in these circumstances, the lawyer should make a record of the fact that the defendant is taking the stand against the advice of counsel in some appropriate manner without revealing the fact to the court. The lawyer must confine his examination to identifying the witness as the defendant and permitting him to make his statement to the trier or the triers of the facts; the lawyer may not engage in direct examination of the defendant as a witness in the conventional manner and may not later argue the defendant's known false version of facts to the jury as worthy of belief and he may not recite or rely upon the false testimony in his closing argument."
For cases where this situation has arisen, see Annotation, Rights and Duties of Attorney in a Criminal Prosecution Where Client Informs Him of Intention to Present Perjured Testimony, 64 A.L.R.3d 385 et seq.
This problem has previously been before this court. In State v. Henderson, 205 Kan. 231, 468 P.2d 136 (1970), the accused informed his

In this trespass to try title suit,
Eddie Dyer sued Ronald Cotton, claiming that, in addition to procuring an
undivided 1/7th interest to farmland in Grimes County by conveyance, he also had
acquired title to the remaining 6/7th interest by adverse possession.  A jury disagreed, finding that Dyer had not
adversely possessed the property, and the trial court signed a take-nothing
judgment against Dyer.  On appeal, Dyer
contends that no legally or factually sufficient evidence supports the jury’s
finding that Dyer had failed to acquire title to the farmland by adverse
possession.  He further contends that the
trial court erred by (1) including a jury instruction requiring Dyer to
establish ouster of his other co-tenants to prove adverse possession; (2) allowing
evidence of other adverse possession and property dispute lawsuits in which
Dyer was involved; and (3) allowing the testimony of a witness whom Cotton
did not properly disclose during discovery and whose testimony violated the
parol evidence rule.  We conclude that
sufficient evidence supports the jury’s verdict and that the trial court did
not abuse its discretion in its jury instructions or evidentiary rulings.  We therefore affirm.
Background
Carrie Venters owned 46.646 acres
of farmland in Grimes County.  When she died
intestate in 1958, the property passed to her seven children in equal,
undivided interests under the laws of succession.  A house stood within a thirty-two-acre wooded
area on part of the property.  Another
approximately eleven-acre portion was cleared and used for grazing and
farming.  The property also had a tank
pond, which a nearby church periodically used for baptisms.  An old, three-strand, barbed-wire fence
surrounded the property.  
During his lifetime, Carrie Venters’
son, Lee “Snap” Venters, used the property for growing hay and grazing
cattle.  Snap repaired the old fence when
it broke through.  He also harvested
timber from the property.  His siblings
occasionally visited the property to hunt

Hines argues that even if Ms. Brummet did consent, her consent was not voluntary. "The voluntariness of a person's consent to search is a question of fact that we review under the clearly erroneous standard." United States v. Carrate, 122 F.3d 666, 670 (8th Cir.1997). The district court's finding that Ms. Brummet's consent was voluntary was not clearly erroneous. The court weighed the hearsay testimony of the defense counsel's investigator (who testified that Ms. Brummet had told him shortly before her death that she felt that she had been coerced into signing the consent form) against the direct testimony of the officers on the scene (that Ms. Brummet had voluntarily signed the consent form, had not been coerced or threatened, and that she never indicated that she did not understand her right to refuse consent), and credited the police officers' recounting of the facts. "[W]hen a trial judge's finding is based on his decision to credit the testimony of one of two or more witnesses, each of whom has told a coherent and facially plausible story that is not contradicted by extrinsic evidence, that finding, if not internally inconsistent, can virtually never be clear error." Welerford, 356 F.3d at 935-36 (internal quotations omitted); see also United States v. Dupree, 202 F.3d 1046, 1049 (8th Cir.2000).


11
Hines also argues that the search exceeded the scope of the consent because the consent form referred to an attached garage, while the residence had only an unattached garage. We disagree. "The standard for measuring the scope of consent under the Fourth Amendment is that of `objective' reasonableness-what would the typical reasonable person have understood by the exchange between the officer and the individual?" United States v. Adams, 346 F.3d 1165, 1171 (8th Cir. 2003). Under this standard, the fact that the garage was not, in fact, attached does not invalidate the consent. The residence had only one garage, and it is thus objectively reasonable to assume that the parties understood the consent form to refer to the only garage on the property. Likewise, we reject Hines's argument that Ms. Brummet did not have the authority to consent to a search of the garage. The district court clearly adopted the magistrate judge's finding that Ms. Brummet had mutual use of and joint access

No. 14564.
Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia.
June 30, 1981.
*647 DiTrapano, Jackson & Buffa and E. Joseph Buffa, Jr., Charleston, for appellant.
Ernest V. Morton, Jr., Webster Springs, for appellee.
PER CURIAM:
In this appeal, Ralph Johnson, the Sheriff of Nicholas County, West Virginia, seeks reversal of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Nicholas County reinstating the appellee, Michael Kendrick, to his position as a deputy sheriff. Johnson discharged the appellee from employment by letter effective September 1, 1977. The appellee denied the charges and a hearing was held before the Nicholas County Deputy Sheriff's Civil Service Commission which sustained the discharge, holding that the sheriff met his burden of proving "just cause" for dismissal. W.Va.Code, 7-14-17(a). The deputy appealed to the Circuit Court of Nicholas County which reversed the decision of the civil service commission and ordered reinstatement with back pay. Thereafter, this Court granted the sheriff's petition for review of the circuit court's decision. For the reasons that follow, we reverse and set aside the judgment of the trial court.
The civil service commission in upholding the dismissal found, among other things, that (1) the deputy used offensive language in the presence of three members of the Nicholas County Emergency Ambulance Service wholly without justification; (2) the deputy unnecessarily threatened to impose criminal penalties upon the driver of the ambulance; and (3) the deputy probably used excessive physical force and personal abuse in the arrest of an individual initially stopped for an alleged traffic violation.
The circuit court did not question the Commission's first two findings of misconduct but ruled that the deputy's transgressions were not sufficient to warrant dismissal. The court also expressly affirmed the Commission's finding that the deputy probably used excessive force and personal abuse in making an arrest, but concluded this finding did not warrant dismissal because the deputy's actions were not taken "without justification."
Final orders of civil service commissions are subject to limited judicial review. In reviewing the decisions of police civil service commissions, we have held:
"A final order of a police civil service commission based upon a finding of fact will not be reversed by a circuit court upon appeal unless it is clearly wrong or is based upon a mistake of law." Syl. pt. 1, City of Logan v. Dingess, W.Va., 242 S.E.

II. DISCUSSION

A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction
As a preliminary matter, a question of subject matter jurisdiction is presented.
Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that plaintiffs include in their *96 pleadings "a short and plain statement of the grounds upon which the court's jurisdiction depends, unless the court already has jurisdiction and the claim needs no new grounds of jurisdiction to support it." FED. R. CIV. P. 8(a)(1). This rule serves to guarantee that federal courts, which are courts of limited jurisdiction, have notice of the jurisdictional basis upon which plaintiffs rest their case.
In the case at bar, the Complaint rests jurisdiction upon diversity of citizenship. Plaintiffs are citizens of the State of Pennsylvania, and Scanlon is a citizen of the State of New York. The amount in controversy, moreover, exceeds $75,000. See 28 U.S.C.A. § 1332(a)(1). Thus, subject matter jurisdiction is present over the main action under 28 U.S.C. § 1332.
The Third-Party Complaint, by contrast, contains no statement of subject matter jurisdiction. In the third-party defendants' Answer to the Third-Party Complaint, they assert that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the impleader action. As always, this Court must ensure that subject matter jurisdiction is present over all claims. SeeAmetex Fabrics, Inc. v. Just In Materials, Inc., 140 F.3d 101, 104 (2d Cir.1998); Ash v. Artpack Int'l, Inc., 1998 WL 132932, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. March 23, 1998).
To begin, subject matter jurisdiction is not present over the Third-Party Complaint by virtue of 28 U.S.C. § 1332. Scanlon and the third-party defendants are both citizens of the State of New York, and accordingly, the requirement of complete diversity is not met. See 28 U.S.C.A. § 1332. Furthermore, the Third-Party Complaint does not implicate any federal questions to establish subject matter jurisdiction. See 28 U.S.C.A. § 1331.
The statutory doctrine of supplemental jurisdiction, however, saves the day for the Third-Party Complaint. See 28 U.S.C.A. § 1367. Section 1367(a) provides that "district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that

appellee.

September 27, 1999

          Per Curiam. Pro se appellant Joan Oliveri filed a
civil action in the district court, claiming that her
employment had been terminated in violation of the Americans
with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.  12101 et seq.  She appeals
from the court's grant of judgment as a matter of law in favor
of appellee Paul A. Gargano.  We affirm for the following
reasons.
          The district court granted judgment for the defendant
after a bench trial at which Oliveri testified and submitted
documents into evidence.  On the basis of her testimony and the
documentary evidence, the court concluded that she had filed
her administrative claim against Gargano &amp; Associates, P.C., a
professional corporation, as her employer.  Ruling that the
distinction between Gargano, the individual, and the
professional corporation bearing his name applied even in the
employment discrimination context, the court concluded that
Oliveri could not bring the instant suit against Gargano
because she had not filed her administrative charge against
him.  In so doing, the court adhered to the general rule that
plaintiffs asserting employment discrimination claims in a
civil action must previously have pursued an administrative
charge against the defendant named in the lawsuit.  See Virgo
v. Riviera Beach Assoc., Ltd., 30 F.3d 1350, 1358-59 (11th Cir.
1994) (stating the general rule).  
          On appeal, the appellant presents a single, very
narrow claim.  She contends that she filed her administrative
charge

affirm.

      The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Holmberg’s motion

to compel additional discovery or his request to continue defendants’ summary

judgment motion until he received additional discovery because Holmberg failed to

show how the additional discovery was necessary to defeat summary judgment.

See Blough v. Holland Realty, Inc., 574 F.3d 1084, 1091 (9th Cir. 2009) (denial of

continuance to conduct further discovery appropriate when the district court

considers the merits of the motion and concludes that there is no point to pursuing

the requested discovery); Tatum v. City & County of San Francisco, 441 F.3d

1090, 1100-01 (9th Cir. 2006) (requirements for obtaining additional discovery

Plaintiff, Larry J. Downes, filed a Complaint in this Court on February 20, 2003, seeking review of the Commissioner's decision to deny his claim for Social Security benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 401 et seq. This Court may review a final decision by the Commissioner. 42 U.S.C. § 405(g). For the reasons set out herein, the decision of the Commissioner is reversed and remanded for further administrative proceedings.
Plaintiff filed an application for Social Security Disability Benefits on March 13, 1997, claiming to be disabled since February 18, 1996. Tr. at 92. Plaintiff was last insured to receive disability benefits at the end of December, 2001. Tr. at 95. After the applications were denied, initially and on reconsideration, Plaintiff requested a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge. A hearing was held before Administrative Law Judge Thomas M. Donahue (ALJ) on April 9, 1998. Tr. at 19-76. The ALJ issued a Notice Of Decision  Unfavorable on August 10, 1998. Tr. at 9-15. After the decision was affirmed by the Appeals Council on December 27, 2002 (Tr. at 5-7), Plaintiff filed a Complaint in this Court on February 20, 2003.
*1073 In this case, the ALJ stopped the sequential evaluation after finding that Plaintiff is engaged in substantial gainful activity. The ALJ found that Plaintiff was still engaging in his work as a farmer, and thus the other steps of the sequential evaluation were not relevant to determining the merits of Plaintiff's application.
At the hearing, Plaintiff testified that when he gets up in the morning  about 6:30  he walks about 200 feet to check on 19 cows. "If they need hay, I've got to get on the tractor and take them a big bale of hay..." Tr. at 24. Plaintiff said that he also oversees an isolation unit where pigs are raised. "... it's about a half mile from home. I'll get in the pickup, I drive over there ... I walk through to make sure that they got water and feed. That there's no sick ones, you know, just analyze them and just take your time and just walk along, and the feed system's all automatic." Tr. 25. To feed the animals, Plaintiff said he turns on an electrical switch and an auger brings feed to each pen. He said that he walks through the building which

To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the petitioner must show that his attorney's performance was deficient, and that he was prejudiced by the deficient representation.  See Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U.S. 364, 369 (1993);  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 688 (1984);  Mason v. Hanks, 97 F.3d 887, 892-93 (7th Cir.1996).  Kester has not shown a reasonable likelihood that he would have prevailed had he appealed the district court's upward departure.  See McCleese, 75 F.3d at 1180.   Accordingly, he cannot demonstrate that he was prejudiced by counsel's failure to object to the upward departure or to appeal the issue.


8
The presentence report recommended an upward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 5K2.0.  Section 5K2.0 permits an upward departure where the reason for the departure is taken into consideration by the Guidelines, but the sentencing range is inadequate.  Because the relevant conduct provisions of the Guidelines take dismissed counts into consideration, the district court's departure was not based on unusual circumstances and was therefore an incorrect application of § 5K2.0.  Nevertheless, Kester did not suffer any prejudice because the court could have imposed the same sentence by applying the relevant conduct provisions.


9
Section 1B1.2(c) of the Guidelines provides that "a plea agreement (written or made orally on the record) containing a stipulation that specifically establishes the commission of additional offense(s) shall be treated as if the defendant had been convicted of additional count(s) charging those offense(s)."   The Commentary to that section states:


10
in the case of a stipulation to the commission of additional offense[s], the guidelines are to be applied as if the defendant had been convicted of an additional count for each of the offenses stipulated.  For example, if the defendant is convicted of one count of robbery but, as part of a plea agreement, admits to having committed two additional robberies, the guidelines are to be applied as if the defendant had been convicted of three counts of robbery.

MEMORANDUM AND ORDER
SARIS, District Judge.

I. Introduction
Plaintiffs,[1] who are present or former students of Hudson High School ("HHS"), allege that defendants unlawfully censored their speech by taking down posters advertising the HHS Conservative Club in violation of their First Amendment rights.[2] The posters listed the website address for a national organization of high school conservative clubs, which in turn contained a link to another website hosting graphic video footage of hostage beheadings in Iraq and Afghanistan. The link to the videos was accompanied by a warning. Defendants assert that the posters were taken down because of the graphic content of the videos, while plaintiffs contend that *172 the true reason was to censor the expression of their political views.
Defendants are John Stapelfeld, the principal; David Champigny, the assistant principal; and Dr. Sheldon Berman, superintendent of the Hudson Public School District; all are sued in their individual and official capacities. The Town of Hudson and HHS have also been sued.
Defendants move for summary judgment, arguing that plaintiffs' rights were not violated because the beheading videos were offensive, capable of causing substantial disruption, and had the potential to cause psychological harm to young students. Therefore, they argue, the school's censorship was within the bounds permitted by the Supreme Court's student speech jurisprudence. The individual defendants also contend that they are entitled to qualified immunity, and the Town argues that municipal liability should not attach to either the Town or HHS. After careful consideration of the difficult issues involved, the Court DENIES-IN-PART and ALLOWS-IN-PART defendants' motion for summary judgment.

BEFORE: SUHRHEINRICH, COLE and GILMAN; Circuit Judges.

       SUHRHEINRICH, Circuit Judge. Plaintiff Mary Sue Gjokaj (Gjokaj) appeals the district

court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant CROSSMARK, Inc. (CROSSMARK).

We Affirm.

       Gjokaj, an at-will employee, worked as an Office Manager/Human Resources Coordinator

in CROSSMARK’s Detroit, Michigan office. She was terminated after attending a court hearing

where a CROSSMARK employee having an affair with a co-worker sought a personal protection

order against the co-worker’s wife for sending her threatening letters. Gjokaj did not inform

CROSSMARK about the hearing until after it occurred.

       CROSSMARK terminated Gjokaj due to a loss of confidence in her ability to perform her

duties as Human Resources Coordinator. Specifically, CROSSMARK maintains that it lost

confidence in Gjokaj for three reasons: (1) the failure to report an affair between two employees, (2)

the failure to report letters that potentially posed a safety threat to another employee and the office,
and (3) attending a court hearing involving two CROSSMARK employees without informing

CROSSMARK, where her attendance was perceived to be on behalf of the company.

         Gjokaj contends that the reasons given were pretextual and that the true reason

CROSSMARK fired her was because she went to court. Gjokaj claims that (1) her termination

violated a Michigan public policy protecting an employee’s right to go to court and (2) her

attendance at the hearing was a protected activity under the Michigan Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act.

M.C.L. §§ 37.2101-37.2804.

        We agree with the district court that neither claim provides Gjokaj with a viable cause of



          Merit Systems Protection Board—Litigating
          Authority (5 U.S.C. § 1205)


   This responds to Assistant Attorney General Babcock’s May 10, 1979,
request for our views concerning the scope o f litigating authority given the
Merit Systems Protection Board under the Civil Service Reform Act,
§ 202(a), 92 Stat. 1111, 5 U .S.C . § 1205(h) (Supp. II, 1978). The relevant
portion o f that subsection o f the Act provides:
      Except as provided in section 518 o f title 28, relating to litigation
      before the Supreme C ourt, attorneys designated by the Chair­
      man o f the Board may appear for the Board, and represent the
     Board, in any civil action brought in connection with any func­
      tion carried out by the Board pursuant to this title or as otherwise
     authorized by law.
We are asked whether that subsection, despite its broad language, might
properly be interpreted to allow the Board to represent itself only where
the Board takes a legal position in litigation adverse to that o f another
Federal agency. We have reviewed the statute and its legislative history
and conclude that the provision granting litigating authority to the Board
must be read more expansively, in accordance with its plain meaning.
   The congressional grant o f litigating authority to the Board had its
origins in § 202(a) o f the Senate bill, S. 2640. The House bill, H. 11280,
contained no comparable provision. The only discussion o f the litigating
authority provision that we have found in the reports and floor debates on
the Reform Act appears in the report o f the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee, S. Rept. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d sess. (1978). That report
states that:
    [t]he Board is to be represented by its own attorneys whenever
    the Board is a party to any proceeding in court, except that the
    Board is to be represented by the Solicitor General o f the United

                                    357
      States in any proceeding before the Supreme C ourt. This will in­
      clude instances where the Board is involved in court proceedings
      under any provision o f this title, including defending disciplinary
      actions * * * intervening in appellate proceedings * * * or


Giving the utmost consideration to all of the state's evidence, including the evidence which the state contends corroborates the story of the prosecuting witness, we feel the evidence of the rape was weak. When we speak of corroboration here we do not mean the statutory corroboration which will be dealt with in the next division. We think it important to point to the weaknesses in the evidence of the rape for here, as in most all rape cases, the central question is the sufficiency of other testimony that tends to connect defendant with the crime. With clear and convincing evidence that the crime of rape was perpetrated by someone at a certain fixed time, an accused's connection with the crime can be more easily established. Here there is doubt as to the day the rape occurred. The indictment names June 8th, or Friday, and Betty's *451 testimony leaves it as occurring that day or the next day. Mrs. Lee says she asked Betty if defendant had tried to "make her" before Saturday and she said "that he hadn't."
I. So the state is left with the burden of introducing evidence tending to establish defendant's connection with a rape that occurred on Friday or Saturday. Section 782.4, Code, 1954, I.C.A., provides, stating it affirmatively, that the story of the prosecuting witness must be "corroborated by other evidence tending to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense." The other evidence introduced by the state was the testimony of persons who saw Betty and defendant go in or come out of the trailer.
Thirteen year old Marla Wilson who lived next door to the Keeler home said she saw Betty and Mr. Seales come out of the trailer. She "believed" the date was Saturday, June 9th in the morning. She did not see them go in and she did not remember who came out first.
Marla's eighteen year old brother, Ronald Wilson, testified he remembered seeing Betty Lee and defendant come out of the trailer. He did not remember who came out first and he could not recall whether it was morning or afternoon, the day of the week or month, but he remembered it was during the summer vacation.
Seventeen year old Bob Keeler couldn't remember whether Rose Simmons worked for Mr. Seales before Betty Lee but he remembered both of them and he recalled seeing Betty Lee and defendant go into the trailer house along about noon sometime on a day the previous summer. He said there were curtains over the windows and

On November 2, 1984, the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin ordered the state election officials to preserve any ballots received from overseas citizens between the time the polls closed on election day and November 16, 1984.  Election officials eventually received 329 ballots which had been timely applied for during this period.  On November 14, 1984, the State of Wisconsin moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, arguing that it was in full compliance with both federal voting acts.  The state agreed that if this motion was denied, it would count all absentee ballots received before November 16, 1984, in the federal elections.


4
On November 30, 1984, the district court denied the motion to dismiss the complaint, finding that it stated a cause of action under the federal voting statutes.  The district court reasoned that although neither statute specifically stated how long before an election absentee ballots must be mailed to voters, a state could defeat the express purposes of the statutes by mailing the ballots without sufficient time for their valid return.  The court therefore entered the agreed order to count the ballots in the elections for federal offices.  On February 26, 1985, the Wisconsin Board of State Canvassers issued a supplemental certification of the election results for federal offices which included the late ballots, thereby complying with the district court's order.  The late ballots did not affect the outcome of any race.  The State of Wisconsin then filed this appeal.

Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution limits federal jurisdiction to actual cases and controversies.   See Nebraska Press Ass'n v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539, 546, 96 S.Ct. 2791, 2796, 49 L.Ed.2d 683 (1976).  It is clear, as the United States admits, that there is no longer a controversy between the parties.  Appellee's br. at 2.  The State of Wisconsin counted the disputed ballots, thereby complying in full with the district court's order.  These ballots made no difference in any race.  No other relief was ordered.  The United States argues, however, that this court has jurisdiction because the dispute between the parties is "capable of repetition, yet evading review."   Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC, 219 U.S. 498, 515, 31 S.Ct. 279, 283, 55 L.Ed.2d 310 (1911).  We disagree.  There is no indication that

I. Factual Background
Plaintiffs entered into a contract with defendant to reconstruct their home and restore the personal property from the home, both of which were heavily damaged in an April 2003 fire caused by a leaking propane valve. Defendant specializes in the cleaning and restoration of structures and personal property damaged by catastrophic events.
Defendant first performed emergency repairs to the structure of the home so that work crews could enter the home, evaluate the damage, and begin making repairs. Following emergency repairs, plaintiffs elected to demolish the existing structure and build a new home, using a different contractor. As a result, defendant's work thereafter was confined to inventorying, cleaning, and restoring plaintiffs' damaged personal property.
It is undisputed that plaintiffs' homeowners' insurance policy provided $358,000 in coverage for the contents of the home, as well as $25,000 in additional coverage for business personal property contained within the home. The insurance policy provided (1) full replacement value for items deemed "unsalvageable"; and (2) payment for the costs of inventorying, cleaning, and restoring personal property deemed "salvageable." All payments were subject to the total limits of the policy noted above. It is also undisputed that plaintiffs exhausted the limits of the policy in the insurance company's payments for defendant's restorative work and for replacement of unsalvageable property.
The insurance company made two payments related to defendant's work. In August 2003, the insurer issued a third-party check to plaintiffs in the amount of $17,353.22 for emergency repairs. Plaintiffs promptly deposited the check and paid the full amount to defendant. In March 2004, the insurer issued a second third-party check to plaintiffs in the amount of $66,355.02 for the inventorying, cleaning, and restoring of plaintiffs' personal property. This check was also deposited and paid to defendant.
In September 2004, defendant delivered the personal property to plaintiffs that had been cleaned and restored. Defendant had inventoried and sorted the property as either salvageable or unsalvageable. Plaintiffs contend that defendant's work was negligently performed because it had either erred in assessing whether property could be salvaged, improperly restored property, or failed to return property that was salvageable. Plaintiffs also complain that defendant damaged their home's heating system when the emergency repairs were made.
*1257 Evidence adduced at trial indicated that defendant failed to return many of the items that defendant had collected for cleaning and restoration. Many of the items that were returned to

FACTS
The facts most favorable to the judgment reveal that on August 12, 1987, Officer Patrick Tompkins (Officer Tompkins) of the Marion County Sheriff's Department stopped Parker for driving through a red light. Upon observing that Parker appeared intoxicated, Officer Tompkins offered Parker the opportunity to submit to a chemical sobriety test (Breathalyzer). Parker refused. Officer Tompkins then informed Parker of the consequences of his refusal under the Implied Consent Law. Again Parker refused to submit to a chemical sobriety test. Later, at the lock-up, Parker changed his mind and requested to take the alcohol breath test.[2] Officer Tompkins refused to give Parker the test.

ISSUES
The issues presented by Parker are restated as:
1. Was the evidence sufficient to sustain Parker's conviction of operating a vehicle while intoxicated?
2. Were Parker's statutory and constitutional rights violated when the arresting officer refused Parker's request for a chemical sobriety test when Parker had twice refused an offer by the arresting officer?

DECISION
ISSUE ONE  Was the evidence sufficient to support Parker's conviction of operating a vehicle while intoxicated?
PARTIES' CONTENTIONS  Parker claims the evidence is insufficient to sustain the conviction because his testimony *130 contradicted the testimony of the arresting officer.
The State responds that the evidence is sufficient.
CONCLUSION  The evidence is sufficient to sustain the conviction.
If there is substantial evidence of probative value to support the judgment, we will not reverse. Clark v. State (1987), Ind. App., 512 N.E.2d 223. Officer Tompkins testified that Parker had bloodshot eyes, slurred speech, the odor of alcohol on his breath, and difficulty in removing papers from his glove compartment. Parker also failed the field sobriety finger-to-nose test and was unable to recite the alphabet in proper sequence. Parker's failure of these tests supported Officer Tompkins' belief that Parker was intoxicated. Deputy Larry Harding, who was also on the scene, corroborated Officer Tompkins' testimony and additionally noted that Parker was staggering. The fact that Parker drove through a red light was further evidence that the influence of alcohol impaired his thought and action to such an extent as to endanger others. See id. The evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction for operating a vehicle while intoxicated. See Jennings v. State (1987), Ind. App., 503 N.E.

       The attorney appointed to represent Anastacio Aranda Soto has moved
for leave to withdraw and has filed a brief in accordance with Anders v.
California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), and United States v. Flores, 632 F.3d 229 (5th
Cir. 2011).     Aranda Soto has not filed a response, has completed the
confinement portion of his sentence, and has been removed from the United

States. We have reviewed counsel’s brief and the relevant portions of the
record reflected therein. We concur with counsel’s assessment that Aranda
Soto’s appeal of his conviction presents no nonfrivolous issue. Accordingly,
counsel’s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from
further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED in part as
frivolous, see 5TH CIR. R. 42.2, and in part as moot, see United States v.

       Scanno first challenges the District Court’s conclusion that she had only limited

success on the merits of her case, arguing that her total recovery, including attorney’s

fees, increased from June 2017 to September 2017. 12

       The reasonableness of the fee award on the merits of the case is clear from the

District Court’s reasoning. The District Court observed that, in June 2017, Scanno

rejected a settlement offer which allowed her to recover the maximum statutory award of

$1,000, only to incur twenty-five hours of additional legal services and accept the very

same offer three months later. Scanno’s rejection of the June 2017 settlement offer

appears to have been driven primarily by counsel’s independent belief that the offer did

not account for all attorney’s fees incurred since the commencement of the litigation. 13

Even considering that Scanno’s counsel brought this suit as a class action, the case was

ultimately settled on an

cannot allow its own evaluation of the Class’s best interests to dictate its

conclusion as to whether the requirements of Rule 23 were satisfied.

      Finally, we reject Appellees’ contention that approval of the settlement was

permissible because it only partially foreclosed the Class’s individualized claims.

Appellees point out that, because the settlement releases only Daikin, class

members can still pursue their individualized claims against 3M and Dyneon. But

neither Dukes nor Rule 23 allows parties to preclude absent class members’

individualized claims against one defendant, as long as those claims can still be

pursued against other parties who may have different defenses, levels of

culpability, and resources with which to satisfy a judgment.

      Put simply, the parties may not accomplish through class settlement what

they otherwise would be unable to accomplish through class litigation—precluding

absent class members’ individualized claims for monetary damages without

providing notice and an opportunity to opt out. The district court abused its

discretion by failing to apply the correct legal standard for certification under Rule

23(b)(2). See Dukes, 564 U.S. at 361–65, 131 S. Ct. at 2557–60.

                                 III. CONCLUSION

      The district court abused its discretion by determining the Class was

adequately represented by counsel laboring under an inherent conflict of interest.

It also abused its discretion by certifying a class under Rule 23(b)(2) and approving

a settlement that released absent class members’ individualized claims for

monetary damages. We therefore vacate the class certification, reverse approval of

the settlement, and remand for further proceedings.

Appeal from the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida.
Before KRAVITCH, HATCHETT and CLARK, Circuit Judges.
KRAVITCH, Circuit Judge:


1
Elvira Cordero was convicted by a jury of possession with intent to distribute a quantity of cocaine in excess of 500 grams and of conspiracy to possess and distribute the same in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2 and 21 U.S.C. Secs. 841(a)(1), 846.  The trial court sentenced Cordero to serve concurrent mandatory five-year terms on the substantive count and the conspiracy count and to a subsequent four-year term of supervised release, all pursuant to the enhanced penalty provisions of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b).1   The sole issue presented on appeal is whether the evidence adduced at trial was sufficient as a matter of law to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the amount of cocaine involved was 500 grams or more and, thus, sufficient to trigger the penalty enhancement provisions of section 841(b).2   Concluding that the evidence adduced was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the amount of cocaine involved was in excess of 500 grams, we affirm.3

I.
The following facts are undisputed:

2
On May 27, 1987 a confidential informant (CI) working with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) spoke with Cordero via telephone and arranged to meet her later that day at the Miami, Florida residence of one Enrique Navarro.  There, Cordero and Navarro were to sell to the CI and the CI's companion, Special Agent Moratta of the DEA, five kilograms of cocaine.


3
Approximately fifteen minutes after the CI and Agent Moratta arrived at the Navarro residence, Cordero arrived.  Upon her arrival, Cordero removed a large pink shoulder bag from the trunk of the car she was driving.  Once inside Navarro's apartment, Cordero removed from the shoulder bag a yellow, duct-taped package which she handed to Agent Moratta.

I respectfully dissent from that part of the majority opinion reversing the judgment on the ground that there was a defective joinder of the parties.
Appellant makes no complaint of the judgment on its merits. The only complaint is that the court did not have jurisdiction to enter the judgment because the husband was joined only as a pro forma party as distinguished from a real party. Appellant made no objection to the joinder of the husband as a pro forma party until after trial when appellees presented the trial court a proposed judgment in which the husband and wife were allowed to recover jointly.
While from a purely technical standpoint, the conclusion reached by the majority appears to have some support in the cases cited therein, I do not believe that the application of these narrow, technical rules are applicable under the facts or the present day rules of civil procedure. I am opposed to a reversal of the case on the ground that there is a defect in the parties for two reasons.
First, it must be remembered that in 1967, the 60th Legislature at page 739, ch. 309, made some significant changes in the law with respect to the rights, duties, privileges, powers and liability of spouses. Among other changes, the legislature passed Art. 4621, V.A.T.S. giving each spouse the exclusive control and disposition of that community property which he or she would have owned if a single person and also provided for combined control and management over all other community property.
At the same session, the legislature also enacted Art. 4626, V.A.T.S., providing that:
"A spouse may sue and be sued without the joinder of the other spouse. When claims or liabilities are joint and several, the spouses may be joined under the rules relating to joinder of parties generally." Amended by Acts 1963, 58th Leg., p. 1188, ch. 472, sec. 6, eff. Aug. 23, 1963; Acts 1967, 60th Leg., p. 739, ch. 309, sec. 1, eff. Jan. 1, 1968.
Thus, since the legislature granted the wife sole management and control over that community property which she would have owned if a single person and also provided that she is to have joint control over all other community, I take the position that in passing Art. 4626, supra, the legislature intended to grant the wife the right to protect her interest in the community by suing without the joinder of her husband. At any rate however, Art. 4626 specifically provides

2
After being terminated from the cardiology staff at Good Samaritan Hospital, Dr. John Smith filed a complaint in federal district court for antitrust conspiracy.  The district court granted summary judgment to the hospital.  The district court also imposed $2,000 in Rule 11 sanctions against Smith's attorney, Jerome Berg, for misconduct including failing to read the papers he filed with the court.


3
Smith appealed and the hospital asked for fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. § 11113 claiming the appeal was frivolous.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court.   Smith v. Ricks, 31 F.3d 1478, 1488 (9th Cir.1994), cert. denied, 115 S.Ct. 1400 (1995).  That panel agreed the appeal was frivolous and imposed Rule 38 sanctions against Berg, reasoning that Berg was responsible for the frivolous appeal and should bear the costs.


4
The previous panel has already addressed Berg's contentions that he was sanctioned in violation of General Order 10.9.  The only remaining issue is whether the district court abused its discretion in calculating the amount awarded to defendants.


5
The district court referred the case to a federal magistrate judge who made a report and recommendation to the district court that $110,909.21 in fees and costs be awarded to defendants.  This recommendation was "a concise but clear explanation of its reasons for the fee award,"  Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 437 (1982), and was adopted by the district court.  The district court is charged with determining the appropriate amount of fees and will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.   Lyddon v. Geothermal Properties, Inc., 996 F.2d 212, 213 (9th Cir.1993).


6
As correctly pointed out by appellees, the arguments now raised that are pertinent to this appeal have been waived by Berg.  Even if he had preserved them, we hold that the magistrate judge correctly determined the lodestar amount and reduced the fee award where charges were duplicative or inappropriate.  The district court did not abuse its discretion by adopting the magistrate's recommendation.


7
AFFIRMED.

1
The Opinion filed March 7, 2002 is amended as follows: on slip opinion page 3832, last paragraph (that carries over to page 3833) [282 F.3d at 1152], change the paragraph to read:


2
The overall scheme of the new legislation reflects that by specifically making the repeal of § 377 retroactive to the date of the enactment of the IRCA, the statutory language was intended to remove a jurisdictional obstacle to litigation over applications pursuant to both the IRCA and the newly amended LIFE Act, and was not intended to retroactively bestow jurisdiction on the district court for the purposes of awarding fees.


3
At the end of this paragraph (following "awarding fees"), the following footnote should be inserted:


4
In so ruling, we make no judgment on whether a district court may, in response to a Rule 60(b) motion, or whether a Court of Appeals may, in response to a timely appeal, reinstate dismissed claims of substantial cause plaintiffs.


5
With these amendments, the panel has voted to deny the petition for rehearing and reject the suggestion for rehearing en banc.

 6   December 2, 2000 custodial interview of Fell conducted by the Vermont State Police; and

 7   (iv) certain undated and unsigned handwritten letters purportedly written by Lee from

 8   prison following his arrest for his role in the murders of Conway, Debbie, and King.2 See

 9   Dkt. No. 103 at 11–12 (2d Cir. Nov. 14, 2017). Each statement broadly inculpates Lee

10   principally in the killings of Debbie and King, while also discussing in detail Fell’s role

11   in the murder of all three victims.

12            After a lengthy hearing following our order, the district court concluded that,

13   except for most of the handwritten letters, the statements by Lee that the government

14   seeks to introduce meet due process and FDPA requirements for reliability. In short, the

15   district court concluded that Lee’s statements are sufficiently reliable because they are

16   generally consistent with the evidence that will be admitted at trial.

17            The district court having now concluded that the Lee statements would be

18   inadmissible at sentence-selection under the Sixth Amendment, but largely admissible

19   under the Fifth Amendment and the FDPA, the issue is ripe for our decision. We

       On remand to the district court following our oral argument, the government also sought to introduce reports of the

     the due process clause and the FDPA. Because the government did not identify these statements to us in its
     November 14, 2017 letter, however, we do not think they are properly before us and we come to no conclusion
     regarding their admissibility at sentence-selection.

                                                               4

Argued May 11, 1964.

Mr. Allen S. Gutfleish argued the cause for appellants (Messrs. Weitz & Gutfleish, attorneys; Mr. Donald A. Sterling, on the brief).
Mr. Abraham L. Rosenberg argued the cause for respondents (Messrs. Rosenberg, Schmidt & Greenhalgh, attorneys).
The opinion of the court was delivered by CONFORD, S.J.A.D.
This is an attachment action. The Superior Court, Law Division, entered an order quashing plaintiffs' attachment of New Jersey bank accounts of defendant Limbardo Contracting Ltd., a New York corporation ("Limbardo," hereinafter), levied pursuant to an order for attachment dated February 28, 1964. This court granted leave to appeal.
Other defendants are Royal Concrete Fireproofers, Inc., a New Jersey corporation ("Royal," hereinafter), and certain individual stockholders, officers and agents of Limbardo and Royal. Royal and Limbardo are said to be commonly owned and controlled. The complaint charges, in substance, that plaintiffs, constituting a joint venture, contracted with Royal for the latter to provide all concrete work for the construction of a library building in New York City at a stated guaranteed figure, but that Royal defaulted on the contract; that Royal and Limbardo, through common agents and employees, conspired to defraud plaintiffs by diverting labor and material on the library job site, for which plaintiffs had advanced moneys, to construction projects elsewhere wherein Limbardo alone was contractor.
On return of an order to show cause a judge of the Law Division quashed the writ of attachment on the basis of

              cigarettes.

       Parsons’s two other children, who were seven and eight years old at the time, were

in the household during the beating. At one point, the eight-year-old child woke up from

a nap, looked up from underneath the covers, and saw D.P.’s face covered in blood.

Jones left the residence on June 3, 2011, and spoke with a friend, Kristi Schofner, about

D.P.’s beating; Schofner called the police.

                                               2
      Officers from the Greensburg Police Department and the Indiana State Police

along with emergency personnel were dispatched to Parsons’s house and found D.P.

dead. Parsons and her two other children were still in the house. D.P. had injuries over

ninety percent of his body, and the Marion County Coroner later determined that the

cause of death was from “multiple blunt force traumatic injuries from head to toe with

partial thickness thermal burns to the face.” Id. at 43. The officers observed blood in

various places inside the house. Officers transported Parsons to the Greensburg Police

Station for questioning and, after locating Jones, transported him, too. Jones indicated

that Parsons was the one who beat D.P.; he alluded to some participation but then

retracted the statements. During Parsons’s initial interview, she indicated that Jones was

not involved in the death of D.P.; however, during the second interview on June 4, 2011,

Parsons admitted that she and Jones beat D.P. for a period of twelve hours because they

believed that D.P. had hidden some pills.

that this court dismiss the appeal without prejudice. On October 20 this court

granted Arnold’s motion to dismiss his appeal.

      On October 30, the district court issued an order, based upon the magistrate

judge’s report and recommendation, denying (1) Arnold’s motion, and renewed

motion, to vacate the restitution order, (2) his petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus,

(3) his motion for production of documents and transcripts and records, and (4)

his alternative motion to withdraw his plea. (See Tr. Rec. Doc. 52.)

      On March 12, 1998, Arnold filed with this court an Application for

Certificate of Appealability, which constitutes the basis for the matter before us

now. In his application, Arnold states that this appeal is based upon the district

court’s denial of his motion to vacate its order of restitution.

(See Application for COA at 2.) From our reading of this application and the

record, we construe this appeal to be a request for a certificate of appealability

under § 2255. See 28 U.S.C.A. § 2253(c) (West Supp. 1998).

       Under § 2253(c), we examine the appeal of a denial of a § 2255 motion to

determine whether the petitioner has made a “substantial showing of the denial of

a constitutional right.” Id.; see Lennox v. Evans, 87 F.3d 431,433-34 (10th Cir.

French argues on appeal that he has been mentally incompetent for the past 16 years, that he was unaware of his entitlement to the disability benefits, and he did not become aware of the benefits until shortly before he applied for disability retirement in 1984.  This is disputed.  The issue in this case, as we view it, is whether a mental incompetent, without assistance of counsel or conservator, is to be required to establish or allowed to attempt to show his own incompetency for many years in the past.  We hold that it is patently unreasonable and fundamentally unfair to require or allow an incompetent to act as advocate in such a setting where even a sane attorney would be confronted with a difficult task.  Exercise of the statutory discretion in such a manner is an abuse of discretion.

In Marcee v. United States, 455 F.2d 525, 527, 197 Ct.Cl. 363 (1972), one of our predecessor courts attempted to prescribe some kind of fair treatment in a 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8337(b) disability claim so that the present incompetent will not lose out because he failed, without assistance of counsel, to prove his own past incompetence.  There was a history of belated filings rejected by the former Civil Service Commission because it ignored the mental condition of the claimant which it knew.  Finally a conservator petitioned.  In Marcee, the court considered the type of role the government should take in such a disability claim:It might be supposed that the Congress expected the CSC [Civil Service Commission] not to sit passively back and leave the incompetent former employee to prove her incompetence.  It could have taken the initiative in looking into the matter so that the obvious desire of Congress should be respected, that former employees disabled in the course of honorable service should not be reduced to penury.

Id. at 526.

The court remanded the case.  Be it noted that Marcee too was a Tucker Act suit and 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2501 was also applicable.  We reaffirm the reasoning in Marcee and add that it is also unfair that the full board's decision regarding French's disability was based on the incompetent's testimony at the hearing, with its admissions, rather than on medical evidence regarding his sickness and its duration.


11
This case is unlike Marcee in that there is still no conservator and thus no one competent to pursue

(Emphasis added.) Relying on Corr, the defendant contends that the drug and wildlife charges were required to be joined under the compulsory joinder statute because they allegedly involved separate acts, albeit unrelated, that occurred on the defendant's property over the same period of time. The defendant misconstrues our opinion in Corr. We have never held that nearness in time and place between several offenses, without more, requires their joinder under section 18-1-408(2). We merely pointed out that under the circumstances of a particular case compulsory joinder may include offenses committed within the same unit of time at the same location. We have repeatedly stated that a closer connection between two or more offenses must be established before they are deemed to arise from "the same criminal episode." See People v. Freeman, 196 Colo. 238, 583 P.2d 921 (1978) (the compulsory joinder rule is designed to prevent the state from bringing successive prosecutions for the same criminal conduct); People v. Tulipane, 192 Colo. 476, 560 P.2d 94 (1977) (the purpose of the compulsory joinder statute is to prevent the bringing of successive prosecutions based upon essentially the same conduct); People v. Walker, 189 Colo. 545, 542 P.2d 1283 (1975) (a trial court is not obligated to sever two counts of assault, where the evidence clearly indicated that the two counts arose out of the same continuous sequence of events and were based on two acts connected together); People v. Cooke, 186 Colo. 44, 525 P.2d 426 (1974) (the statute protects against harassment of the defendant *918 by means of multiple prosecutions for the same act).
Our decision in Brutcher v. District Court, 195 Colo. 579, 580 P.2d 396 (1978), is illustrative. In Brutcher, the petitioner drove through an intersection at a high rate of speed, ignoring a traffic officer's order to stop. As he left the intersection, the petitioner began weaving between two lanes of traffic. Ten minutes later, the petitioner returned to the intersection and struck the traffic officer from behind. Other officers arrived, and the petitioner was arrested after a high-speed chase. The petitioner was charged in county court with failing to drive in a single lane, disregarding a police officer, and attempting to elude a police officer, and charged in district court with vehicular eluding and assaulting a police officer

Before CAMPBELL and HANCOCK and PIRTLE, JJ.
MEMORANDUM OPINION
	Appellant, M.H., filed a notice of appeal from the trial court's order terminating his
parental rights to his children.  We dismiss this appeal for want of jurisdiction.
 An appeal from an order terminating the parent-child relationship is accelerated and 
governed by the rules for accelerated appeals in civil cases.  See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. §§
109.002(a) and 263.405(a) (Vernon 2009).  Rule 26.1(b) of the Texas Rules of Appellate
Procedure provides that in an accelerated appeal, the notice of appeal must be filed within
twenty days after the order is signed.  Moreover, neither a motion for new trial, a request
for findings of fact and conclusion of law, nor any other post-trial motion will extend the
deadline for filing a notice of appeal under Rule 26.1(b).  See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. §
263.405(c) (Vernon 2009).  See also In re K.A.F., 160 S.W.3d 923, 926-27 (Tex. 2005). 
 The termination order was signed on September 15, 2009, making the notice of
appeal due on or before October 5, 2009.  Applying the fifteen-day extension provided by
Rule 26.3 of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure, the notice of appeal could have been
filed as late as October 20, 2009.  The notice of appeal was filed in the trial court on
October 22, 2009.  Pursuant to Rule 42.3(a) of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure,
by letter dated November 4, 2009, this Court notified counsel of the untimely filed notice
of appeal and directed counsel to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed for
want of jurisdiction.  Counsel was also notified that a post-judgment motion would not

PHILLIPS, Judge.
Of the several contentions that the appellant makes in his quest for a new trial it is necessary to discuss just one, as a new trial is clearly required and the developments that gave rise to the other contentions are not likely to recur. For when Judge Cornelius disregarded Judge Burroughs' prior order directing that plaintiff be examined by a psychiatrist and that a hearing be held on the issue of plaintiff's competency this case took a wrong turn prejudicial to the plaintiff as the foregoing facts indicate. Judge Burroughs' order, entered several months before trial, was based upon a well supported finding that there was "a substantial question" as to *255 the plaintiff's competency and it was error for the court to go forward with the case before that question was properly resolved. Rutledge v. Rutledge, 10 N.C.App. 427, 179 S.E.2d 163 (1971).
When a party to a lawsuit in this state is mentally incompetent he must be represented by his Guardian if he has one, and if not by a Guardian ad litem. Rule 17(b), N.C. Rules of Civil Procedure. As pointed out in Hagins v. Redevelopment Commission, 275 N.C. 90, 165 S.E.2d 490 (1969) and Rutledge, supra: When a question as to a party's competence arises during the course of a civil action

       The SVPA was amended twice in 2006. Prior to those amendments, an individual
determined to be an SVP was committed to the custody of the Department for a two-year
term. The individual’s term of commitment could be extended for additional two-year
periods. (Former § 6604, as amended by Stats. 2000, ch. 420, § 3; former § 6604.1, as
amended by Stats. 2000, ch. 420, § 4.)
       On September 20, 2006, the Governor signed into law Senate Bill No. 1128,
which amended the SVPA effective immediately. (Stats. 2006, ch. 337, § 62.) Among
other changes, the amended SVPA provided for an indeterminate term of commitment,
and the references to two-year commitment terms and extended commitments in sections
6604 and 6604.1 were eliminated. (Stats. 2006, ch. 337, §§ 55, 56.)
       Less than two months later, voters approved Proposition 83, which amended the
SVPA effective November 8, 2006. (See Cal. Const., art. II, § 10, subd. (a).) Like
Senate Bill No. 1128, Proposition 83 amended the SVPA to provide that an SVP’S
commitment term is “indeterminate.” (§ 6604; see § 6604.1.) Proposition 83 also
eliminated all references to a two-year term of commitment and most references to an
extended commitment in sections 6604 and 6604.1. Thus, a person found to be an SVP
under the SVPA is now subject to an indeterminate term of involuntary civil
commitment. (People v. Whaley (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 779, 785-787.)
       B. McKee I
       In McKee I, the defendant argued that his indeterminate commitment under the
SVPA violated his equal protection rights because the SVPA treats SVP’s significantly
less favorably than similarly situated individuals who are civilly committed under other
statutes. (McKee I, supra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 1196.) The California Supreme Court
determined that SVP’s and mentally disordered offenders (MDO’s; Pen. Code, § 2960
et seq.) are similarly situated for equal protection purposes because they have been
involuntarily committed with

Lozano did not file his federal habeas petition until August 7, 2002, but he claims that his petition is timely because his sentence modification in March 2002 somehow "reset" the one-year limitations period. Specifically, he contends that the sentence modification was a further stage of direct review, and his conviction was therefore not final until March 2002. Lozano insists that he styled his motion for sentence modification pursuant to §§ 973.19 and 809.30, and he exerts considerable time and energy discussing the technicalities of those sections and why they must always serve as vehicles of direct review under Wisconsin law. However, the fact that his motion was purportedly brought under these two particular sections does not mean that the sentence was modified pursuant to those sections.


8
Lozano's motion cited several cases in addition to the two statutory provisions; several of these cases are not consistent with his set of facts. For example, in Klimas, Rosado, and McCleary, the issue was whether the sentence imposed by the trial judge was an abuse of discretion. Lozano makes no such claim. Lozano's sentence was modified based on a new factor—his cooperation with authorities in the prosecution of Latin Kings gang members. This fact did not exist at the time of Lozano's trial and has no bearing on the constitutionality or finality of his convictions for intentional homicide and armed robbery. The notion that Lozano's sentence modification was a part of the direct review process is a non-starter.


9
Lozano also relies on Orange v. Calbone, 318 F.3d 1167 (10th Cir.2003), for the proposition that his sentence modification constituted direct review. Orange is distinguishable from the facts at bar. One critical distinction is what relief the defendants were seeking. In Orange, the defendant sought leave to file an "appeal out of time." He had failed to timely seek direct review of his conviction and sought the chance to do so. Essentially, the defendant wanted to be put back in the position of a defendant who had timely filed his direct appeal. The Tenth Circuit held that the "appeal out of time" procedure was considered part of the direct review process under Oklahoma law. 318 F.3d at 1170-71. Lozano, on the other hand, was seeking a sentence adjustment based on his post-conviction cooperation with authorities. He was not seeking to be restored to a position in which to challenge the merits of his conviction. The

The court pointed out in the Williams case that the defect relating to the admission of the experiment evidence lay primarily with the inadequate basis relied upon to support its introduction.
What are the dissimilarities of conditions between the courses and bearings of the two aircraft on their flights of July 3, 1968 and July 3, 1970? We look first to the dissimilarities between the two flights of the two Cessna 150 aircraft.
According to the testimony, the pictures were taken at eye level by Galvin, who was 5 feet, 10 inches tall, and weighs 170 pounds; Pitcock, who sat in the same right-hand seat as did Galvin, was 5 feet, 9 inches tall and weighed 168 pounds. The seat could not be raised or lowered, and the record is silent as to whether it could otherwise be adjusted. O'Quinn weighed 190 pounds, and Schuyler weighed 160 pounds.
The Pitcock Cessna 150 was new; the one used for the tests was of the same year and type, so two years later it was presumably about two years old. Presumably the Pitcock Cessna had full fuel tanks; the O'Quinn Cessna had full tanks less what it took for one test run of the course. O'Quinn testified this was a negligible factor.
Visibility on July 3, 1968 at 4:42 P.M. was 7 miles and there was no report of haze; on July 3, 1970 at both 4 P.M. and 5 P.M. visibility was 6 miles with haze, so visibility is indicated to have been a little better at the time of the collision than during the test.
Wind direction at the control tower at 4:42 P.M. on July 3, 1968 was 110 degrees at 12 knots; on July 3, 1970 it was 150 degrees at 10 knots at 4 P.M. and at 5 P.M. it was 100 degrees at 10 knots. We do not know exactly what the wind conditions aloft were on either occasion. O'Quinn testified that the wind would have a negligible effect on the test.
We do not consider that these demonstrated dissimilarities in conditions were sufficient to give rise to confusion or that they were incapable of explanation so as to be readily understood. A more vexing question is whether the evidence as to the course and bearing of the Pitcock Cessna up to the moment of collision was so indefinite and required so many assumptions that the appellee could not sustain his burden of demonstrating

PER CURIAM:

     Appellant appeals from the district court's order denying his

motion for relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (1988), as amended by
Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. No.

104-132, 110 Stat. 1217. We have reviewed the record and the dis-

trict court's opinion accepting the recommendation of the magis-

trate judge and find no reversible error. We also find meritless

Appellant's allegation that his conviction under 18 U.S.C.A.

§ 924(c) (West Supp. 1996) should be reversed in light of Bailey v.

United States, ___ U.S. ___, 64 U.S.L.W. 4039 (U.S. Dec. 6, 1995)

(Nos. 94-7448, 94-7492), because the record reveals evidence beyond

a reasonable doubt to support the conviction under Bailey's "carry-
ing" prong. Id. at 4041-43. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning

of the district court. United States v. Stroman, Nos. CR-94-313;
CA-95-378-3-6BC (D.S.C. Dec. 8, 1995). We dispense with oral

argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately
presented in the materials before the court and argument would not

aid the decisional process.

                       DECISION ON ATTORNEY’S FEES AND COSTS 1

       On September 14, 2018, Sasha Weiser-Freedman (“Petitioner”) filed a petition for
compensation under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, 42 U.S.C.
§300aa-10, et seq., 2 (the “Vaccine Act”). Petitioner alleges that she suffered a shoulder
injury related to vaccine administration following an influenza (“flu”) vaccination on
October 17, 2016. (Petition at 1). On January 22, 2020, a decision was issued awarding
compensation to Petitioner based on Respondent’s proffer. (ECF No. 38.)

       Petitioner has now filed a motion for attorney’s fees and costs, dated March 25,

By contrast, the Hospital chose as its benchmark the percentage of black employees within each job category at the Hospital.27  We call this pool the "workforce" benchmark.28  By use of the workforce benchmark, the Hospital compared the percentage of blacks in the workforce to the percentage of blacks granted both competitive and noncompetitive promotions.  The workforce benchmark is, in fact, based on the pool from which noncompetitive promotions were drawn.  Because the percentage of blacks in the Hospital workforce was less than the percentage of black applicants for competitive jobs, the workforce benchmark potentially understated discrimination with respect to competitive promotions.  Thus, the workforce benchmark also skewed the statistical results, although not as badly as did the applicant flow benchmark because, inter alia, seventy-five percent of promotions were noncompetitive.


48
In sum, both appellants' applicant flow benchmark and appellees' workforce benchmark skewed the results of their statistical analyses:  the applicant flow benchmark overstated any disparity while the workforce benchmark understated any disparity.  Because, however, seventy-five percent of promotions were noncompetitive, the distorting effect of the appellants' applicant flow benchmark was much greater than the distorting effect of the appellees' workforce benchmark.  The latter came closest to the "ideal" analysis and, accordingly, the special master and district court were not clearly erroneous in rejecting the applicant flow benchmark.  See Payne, 673 F.2d at 826 (holding that the court's decision to accept one party's statistical evidence was not clearly erroneous).


49
Appellants rejoin that the district court was required, as a matter of law, to accept their applicant flow benchmark.  They cite several cases for the proposition that courts generally prefer benchmarks based on applicant flow.  For example, in International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 342 n. 20, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 1856-57 n. 20, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977), the Court pointed out that "evidence showing that the figures for the general population might not accurately reflect the pool of qualified job applicants" would be relevant to undercutting the statistical evidence at issue in that case.  Similarly, in EEOC v. Olson's Dairy Queens, Inc., 989 F.2d 165, 169 (5th Cir.1993), the court held that the district court had erred by not fully considering an applicant flow analysis.  "[T]he 'most direct

Stone sued Taylor and Deen individually and as officials of Bacon County, alleging negligent failure to carry out their "specific contractual duty" with regard to the safety of the shoulders of County Road 280. The trial court granted summary judgment to Taylor and Deen, finding them protected by sovereign and official immunity. This is an appeal from that order.
1. Sovereign immunity is the immunity provided to governmental entities and to public employees sued in their official capacities. Gilbert v. Richardson, 264 Ga. 744, 749-750(4), 452 S.E.2d 476 (1994). To the extent applicable, official immunity protects individual public officials and employees for torts they commit in performing their official functions. Id. at 752, 452 S.E.2d 476. Stone does not address the sovereign immunity of Taylor and Deen as Bacon County officials in her enumeration of errors or her brief submitted in support of this appeal. Instead, she focuses on the distinction between ministerial and discretionary duties necessary for deciding the individual liability of Taylor and Deen. We therefore need not address any issues deciding the sovereign immunity of Taylor and Deen as Bacon County officials and turn instead to the question of official immunity.
2. In her first enumeration of error, Stone asserts that Taylor and Deen are not protected by official immunity because the acts involved in this case are ministerial rather than discretionary. We disagree.
"Official immunity ... is applicable to government officials and employees sued in their individual capacities." Hemak v. Houston County School Dist., 220 Ga.App. 110, 112, 469 S.E.2d 679 (1996). "Damage suits are maintainable in this state against government officers and agents for failure to perform ministerial duties, but such officers and employees are immune from negligence claims when the acts complained of involve a discretionary function of an office. [Cit.]" Nelson v. Spalding County, 249 Ga. 334(2)(a), 290 S.E.2d 915 (1982). Whether the acts upon which liability is predicated are ministerial or discretionary is determined by the facts of the particular case. Id.
"A ministerial act is commonly one that is simple, absolute, and definite, arising under conditions admitted or proved to exist, and requiring merely the execution of a specific duty. A discretionary act, however, calls for the exercise of personal deliberation and judgment, which in turn entails examining the facts, reaching reasoned conclusions, and acting on them in a way

OPINION
CONTRERAS, Presiding Judge.
This special action came on regularly for oral argument on April 21, 1992, before Presiding Judge Joe W. Contreras with Judges Ruth V. McGregor and Noel Fidel participating. The matter was taken under advisement and it was determined that an opinion should issue without delay.
After consideration, a majority of the court has concluded that the respondent judge erred in ordering that dual juries be empaneled in this first degree murder case in which the state has requested the imposition of the death penalty. In State v. Lambright, 138 Ariz. 63, 673 P.2d 1 (1983), the Arizona Supreme Court clearly prohibited the use of dual juries[1] in the *567 absence of approved guidelines. In doing so, the court specifically stated that dual juries should not be used in death penalty cases:
[B]ecause this procedure is unauthorized by our rules, trial courts must obtain the approval of the Supreme Court before conducting further trials in this manner. If proposed guidelines are presented for approval, we will then consider whether they successfully minimize the risks of this procedure while maintaining the benefit of conserving judicial resources.
We note that although courts have utilized the dual jury procedure in other murder cases, including one in which the death penalty was given and affirmed, we feel that death penalty cases are inappropriate vehicles for experimentation with new procedures, and the practice should be avoided in the future.

Id. at 70, 673 P.2d at 8 (emphasis added).
In the present special action

The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provide:
Service by mail shall be complete upon deposit of the paper, enclosed in a postpaid, properly addressed wrapper, in a post office or official depository under the care and custody of the United States Postal Service.... Nothing herein shall preclude any party from offering proof that the notice or instrument was not received, or, if service was by mail, that it was not received within three days from the date of deposit in a post office of official depository of the United States Postal Service, and upon so finding, the court may extend the time for taking the action required of such party or grant such other relief as it deems just.
Tex.R.Civ.P. 21a. Rule 21a sets up a presumption that notice of trial setting was duly received by the addressee when the notice has been properly addressed and mailed. Cliff, 724 S.W.2d at 780. This presumption "has the force of a rule of law." Id. However, this presumption may be rebutted by an offer of proof that the notice was not received. Id.
At the hearing on appellant's motion for new trial, appellee argued that appellant's motion was insufficient because it was not supported by affidavits. As a general rule, when a defendant seeks to set aside a default judgment, the motion for new trial "must be supported by affidavits or other evidence proving prima facie that the defendant has ... a meritorious defense." Drake v. McGalin, 626 S.W.2d 786, 787 (Tex.Civ.App.Beaumont 1981, no writ); see also Dallas Heating Co., Inc. v. Pardee, 561 S.W.2d 16, 20 (Tex.Civ.App. Dallas 1977, writ ref'd n.r.e.).
*20 However, as we noted previously, appellant testified under oath that she did not receive notice of the trial setting. Appellant's counsel, in a sworn motion for new trial and in live testimony, stated that she did not receive notice of the trial setting. No controverting evidence was presented. We find that appellant sufficiently rebutted the presumption that she received the notice of trial setting. Thus, it was not necessary for appellant to prove a meritorious defense. Lopez, 757 S.W.2d at 721.
Further, appellant's motion for new trial and the testimony at the hearing thereof sufficiently negated an intentional act or conscious indifference

*721FUCHSBERG, J.
We are required to decide on this appeal whether the provisions of sections 210 and 211 of the Retirement and Social Security Law, which permit former public employees who have reached retirement age to continue working for the government without loss or suspension of pension benefits but which do not extend a like permission to those retired because of disabilities, constitute discriminatory treatment of the disabled.
Petitioner, a former fireman in New York City, retired on a disability pension following an on-the-job injury in 1959. Ten years later, he sought and obtained employment with the New York City Board of Education. Pursuant to the terms of section 1117 of the New York City Charter, his pension benefits were suspended for so long as he remained on the Board of Education payroll. He is still so employed. In 1974, he filed a complaint with the State Division of Human Rights alleging discrimination "in compensation" arising out of his "employment" by the fire department. The State Human Rights Appeal Board dismissed his complaint, commenting that "the action of the New York City Fire Department was not related to complainant's employment but to his pension or retirement". The Appellate Division confirmed the board's determination. For the reasons which follow, we affirm its decision.
Under section 1117 of the New York City Charter, any pension benefits paid by the city must be suspended if the employee subsequently accepts governmental employment, without regard to whether the pension stems from ordinary retirement after a full term of service of from earlier retirement based on disability. However, section 210 of the Retirement and Social Security Law of this State, which expressly overrides any contrary provisions of local law, defines a "retired person" as one receiving benefits "for other than physical *722 disability". Section 211 of that law then provides that such "retired persons" may thereafter accept positions in public service without loss or diminution of pension benefits, but only if they first obtain approval from the State Civil Service Commission or other appropriate civil service body (subd 2). For such permission to be granted it must appear that the pensioners are duly qualified "and physically fit" to perform the proposed duties, that there is a need for their services, and that "there are not

Court of Appeals of Maryland.
Decided February 12, 1957.
The cause was argued before COLLINS, HENDERSON, HAMMOND and PRESCOTT, JJ., and MacGILL, J., Associate Judge of the Fifth Judicial Circuit, specially assigned.
E. Dale Adkins, Jr., and Allen A. Davis, Jr., with whom was Hilary W. Gans on the brief, for the appellant.
*205 Hamilton P. Fox, Jr., with whom were Charles E. Hearne, Jr., and James P. Bailey on the brief, for the appellee.
PRESCOTT, J., delivered the opinion of the Court.
This is an appeal by the defendant below, Monumental Life Insurance Company, from a judgment entered on a verdict by a jury in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of eleven thousand, five hundred eighty-six dollars and eighty-five cents ($11,586.85), with interest, after the trial court had overruled the defendant's motions for judgment n.o.v. and in the alternative for a new trial.
The action was brought on a life insurance policy, within the contestable period of said policy, by the appellee, plaintiff below, primary beneficiary, against the defendant to recover the face amount of the policy and the commuted value of the family income benefits provided under the same.
At the conclusion of the taking of testimony, the defendant offered proper demurrer prayers that requested directed verdicts in its behalf. As our decision must be based upon whether the trial court's rulings were proper, the evidence must be set forth, somewhat in detail, and in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Mrs. Taylor, the plaintiff, was called and testified: that her husband's occupation was that of an insurance man; that she and her husband were living in Easton, Maryland, when he took out the policy; that Dr. Palmer was the physician who examined her husband at that time; that proof of death had been furnished the defendant, and demand for the payment of benefits had been made upon it, which was denied; and, the defendant had proffered to refund the premium paid on the policy. Plaintiff also offered the policy of insurance and the certificate and proof of death. In rebuttal plaintiff testified: that prior to the issuance of the policy, the only physicians consulted by her husband, to her knowledge

Before HIGGINBOTHAM, DUHÉ and EMILIO M. GARZA, Circuit Judges.

PER CURIAM:1

     Appellant,    Michael    West,    brought   this       28   U.S.C.    §   2255

proceeding challenging his drug offense convictions.                The district
court denied relief without a hearing.           We affirm, although on a

different basis than the district court.

     West’s    primary    contention    is   that     his    counsel      rendered

inadequate     assistance   because    he    failed    to    call   West’s      co-

defendants, Taylor and Mitchell, who were tried with him, as alibi

witnesses. West supports his motion with an affidavit from one co-

defendant stating that he told West’s attorney that he would

testify that West was not involved in the activity which was the

subject of the indictment.           The other co-defendant’s affidavit

stated that all the drugs were his, not West’s and that West did

not sell drugs to the undercover agent.               We examine ineffective

assistance claims under the Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668

(1984) standard, and, assuming without deciding that counsel’s

performance was inadequate, conclude that Appellant cannot show

prejudice.     We also conclude that no hearing in the district court

was required.

     West and his co-defendants were tried together. West’s motion

for severance because of his desire              to call one of the co-

defendants was denied.         Since they were tried together, the co-

defendants     would    have   to    waive    their    right   against   self-

incrimination to testify.           The trial record makes it clear that

this would not have happened.          Neither co-defendant testified in

his own defense, so the statement in the affidavit

In attempting to show that the plaintiff still needed support, plaintiff's counsel presumably was relying on the guidelines set forth by the Sixth Circuit in In re Calhoun, 715 F.2d 1103 (6th Cir.1983). The Calhoun Court explained that to determine whether an obligation is in the nature of alimony, maintenance or support "the initial inquiry must be to ascertain whether the state court or the parties to the divorce intended to create an obligation to provide support through the assumption of the joint debts. If they did not, the inquiry ends there." Id. at 1109 (emphasis in original). The Court went on to explain that if the bankruptcy court finds that the threshold element of intent has been satisfied, then the court must inquire whether, inter alia, the assumption of the debt has the effect of providing the support necessary to ensure that the daily needs of the former spouse and any children of the marriage are satisfied. Id. The Court noted that the distribution or existence of other property may make the continuing assumption of joint debts unnecessary for support. Id.
We note that the Sixth Circuit and the Fourth Circuit agree that intent is the threshold element that must be satisfied before other considerations become relevant. Compare Calhoun, 715 F.2d at 1109 with Tilley, 789 F.2d at 1078 n. 4. As explained below, we find that the plaintiff in the case at bar has not carried her burden of proving that both parties intended for the debt at issue to be in the nature of alimony, maintenance or support. Accordingly, our inquiry ends there. We note, however, that even if the plaintiff had met her threshold burden of proving mutual intent, this Court follows the majority rule of not taking into consideration the plaintiff spouse's present needs in a section 523(a)(5) determination. See Forsdick v. Turgeon, 812 F.2d 801, 803-04 (2d Cir.1987) (noting that Sixth Circuit's decision in Calhoun is example of minority view on question of whether bankruptcy court should consider the changed financial circumstances of wife in determining whether an obligation is dischargeable under § 523(a)(5) and finding that there is no warrant for bankruptcy court to evaluate an alimony award against the needs of the former spouse to whom it was granted).

Standards for Summary Judgment
Summary judgment is proper "if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); Cox v. Acme Health Serv., Inc., 55 F.3d 1304, 1308 (7th Cir.1995). A genuine issue of material fact exists for trial when, in viewing the record and all reasonable inferences drawn from it in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party, a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-movant. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); Hedberg v. Indiana Bell Tel. Co., 47 F.3d 928, 931 (7th Cir.1995). The movant has the burden of establishing that there is no genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2553, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). If the movant satisfies this burden, the non-movant must set forth specific facts that demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue for trial. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(e); Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324, 106 S.Ct. at 2553. Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment against a party "who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and in which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. at 2552-53; Waldridge v. American Hoechst Corp., 24 F.3d 918, 920 (7th Cir.1994). A scintilla of evidence in support of the non-moving party's position is not sufficient to oppose successfully a summary judgment motion; "there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the [non-movant]." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250, 106 S.Ct. at 2511.

B. The Complaint and Filings in this Case
In August 2010, Plaintiff Kaufman was indicted in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for, among other things, failure to file tax returns in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7203, attempt to obstruct lawful function of Internal Revenue Service in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7212(a), and making false claims in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 287. See Indictment, United States v. Kaufman, No. 10-cr-553 (E.D.Pa. Aug. 24, 2010), ECF No. 1. Approximately one month after he was indicted, Kaufman, along with Norley, filed this suit against the IRS and other Defendants "acting as agents" for the IRS.
In this case, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants, particularly the IRS, have fraudulently induced Plaintiffs into "involuntary servitude" (¶¶ 21, 30). Plaintiffs allege, among other things, that: 1) the IRS operates in the United States without disclosing that it is a "private" or "foreign usury" debt collector, and an "offshore trust maintained *31 in Puerto Rico" that fraudulently operates in the "secret collection of usury" (¶¶ 11-12; 23-4); 2) the Internal Revenue Code is applicable only to "those who elect to volunteer to submit" to it (¶ 23(k)); and 3) that the IRS and other Defendants have "converted Plaintiffs' value sweat equity to private money for enrichment of Defendants" (¶¶ 30-2). Plaintiffs appear to allege that they are immune from the power of the IRS to impose and collect taxes (¶ 59).
Plaintiffs allege a wide conspiracy, including the IRS and the other Defendants, who have "routinely aided and abetted" the IRS (¶¶ 23(o), 30, 53). In addition to the IRS, the alleged conspiracy includes:[2] 1) Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner; 2) Chairman of the Federal Reserve Benjamin Bernanke; 3) the Depository Trust Company; 4) the Delaware County, Pennsylvania court in which criminal charges for attempted homicide and aggravated assault are currently pending against Norley and Kaufman (Magisterial District Court 32-2-49);[3] 5) the arresting officer on those state criminal charges (Erjon Mollaj); 6

Lust's expert also testified that even with the pivot point located where it was, Clark could have avoided the danger by placing an inexpensive screen in front of the pinch point where Lust was injured.  The screen or guard would have prevented a worker from putting his hand in the space when he attempted to connect the choke rod.


10
As a third means of preventing the type of injury Lust received, the expert testified that Clark should have complied with Standard J-38 promulgated by the Society of Automotive Engineers in 1974, three years before Clark manufactured this machine.  The standard is voluntary, it is not imposed by the government, but it does reflect the judgment of the Society's technical board of directors after extensive review.  Standard J-38 calls for a safety device or a safety bar that will hold the bucket of a loader up to prevent it from being inadvertently lowered while someone is working on the machine.  Clark's machine was not equipped with a safety device.  Two different kinds of devices were offered as optional equipment, but in the opinion of the expert they should have been offered as standard equipment.  Also at the very least, the expert said, Clark should have placed a warning label at the point where Lust's hand got pinched.


11
The expert testified that the danger of the pinch point was not open and obvious except to engineers.  From an engineering standpoint, he explained, the danger of a worker being injured at the pinch point where Lust's hand was crushed was foreseeable.  He added that "the technical literature actually speaks to pinch points of this nature on front end loaders, and the necessity of protecting workers through proper design, guards, [and] stop bars."


12
Clark's evidence was in sharp conflict.  Its expert was the mechanical engineer who led the team that designed the Bobcat in 1970.  He testified that the pivot point was located at the "optimum place" for the efficient operation of the machine, but he admitted that other front end loaders were constructed without a similar pinch point.  He had never heard of a similar accident, and he testified that it was not foreseeable.  Consequently, he believed a guard or warning was unnecessary.  In his opinion the Bobcat was in compliance with Standard J-38 because safety devices were available.


13
Clark's expert also pointed out that the instruction manual warned against making repairs while the engine was running.  The bucket could be lowered, however

MEMORANDUM OPINION
FRANK W. KOGER, Bankruptcy Judge.
Debtors filed their petition for relief under Chapter 12 on March 26, 1987. As debtors in possession they promptly followed that up by filing a Complaint in this adversary proceeding against the Federal Land Bank under § 548 to set aside a prior foreclosure that had occurred on May 7, 1986. The Federal Land Bank filed a Motion to Dismiss the Complaint. The parties (who will hereafter be referred to as plaintiff and defendant) have filed a Stipulation of Facts and submitted this fascinating progeny of Durrett v. Washington National Ins. Co., 621 F.2d 201 (5th Cir.1980) and In re Hulm, 738 F.2d 323 (8th Cir. 1984) on the pleadings and on their Stipulation.
Briefly the facts, as stipulated, are that prior to May 7, 1986, the debtors had been the owners of 206 acres of farm land. There were four mortgages on that real estate, as follows:


     First          Federal Land Bank       $ 135,000.00
Second & Third      Farmers Home Administration     588,830.50
    Fourth          Farm Credit Services            400,000.00
                                                    _____________
                                                    $1,123,830.50

The second and third were also secured by other collateral with a stipulated value of $75,000.00, so that the total indebtedness was only $1,048,830.50 or $5,091.41 per acre. Even that figure reinforces both this Court's high opinion of the fertility, fecundity and superiority of Missouri farmland, and its low opinion of the degree of good sense of the various governmental units that have been so busily handing out taxpayers' money in the form of loans to persons engaged in farming. All of the loans were in default on May 7, 1986, and the debtors were insolvent. The defendant cried its foreclosure sale and was the successful bidder at $135,000.00. That figure undoubtedly represented the defendant's debt, interest and costs and there were no higher bids even though the parties agree and have stipulated that the fair market value on May 7, 1986, was $195,000.00.
Based on these stipulated facts, the plaintiffs pray the Court set aside the sale and order the defendant to transfer the farm back to the plaintiffs. On the other hand, the defendants move

II.
Defendant next contends that the court erred by denying his motion for continuance when the state attempted to add several items to their discovery, two days prior to trial, which were not disclosed in the answer to discovery submitted earlier. These items included a medical report and *748 certain findings that were the result of a physical examination given to the victim after the instant crime. The record shows that the prosecutor claimed that he had not had possession of these items himself until the previous day due to a mix-up at the police crime lab. The court denied defendant's motion for a continuance in order to depose the physician but also ordered that the state was precluded from using anything in its case-in-chief "with regard to those late developing factors."
It is well settled that the granting of a motion for a continuance lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. His determination will be reversed only upon a showing of clear error. Pearson v. State, (1982) Ind., 441 N.E.2d 468; Whitacre v. State, (1980) 274 Ind. 554, 412 N.E.2d 1202. In this case, defendant has not shown any possible exculpatory facts that he expected to obtain from the medical reports or doctor's findings. He has not shown any prejudice since the state was precluded from using this evidence. There is no showing of clear error here.

III.
Defendant next contends that the court erred in admitting his confession and the confession of his co-defendant into evidence. His basic arguments are that his co-defendant's confession was erroneously admitted because the references to himself were not removed and that he was too intoxicated to have given his own confession knowingly and voluntarily. The record shows that the confessions of both of the co-defendants were admitted into evidence in this case and that they were substantially the same. There is nothing in either one that would tend to incriminate the other any more than would his own confession. Both statements included a reference to the fact that defendant had a weapon. All of the details of the incident described in the confessions were fully corroborated by the victim.
It is true that it is error to introduce into evidence a nontestifying co-defendant's confession which is inculpatory of the defendant because it violates the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him. Bruton v. United States, (1968) 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476

*107 In the instant action, the trial court, by the judgment rendered on February 9, 1956, adjudged that the best interests of Keli required that she "be left in the custody of the defendants ... at least until such time as the plaintiff's situation becomes more stabilized." On April 9, 1956, the court modified the judgment, granting the plaintiff limited visitation and custody rights. The judgment was again modified on June 29, 1956, and custody of Keli was granted to the plaintiff for a stated limited period of time. The present motion for modification was heard by the trial court on June 28, 1957. No technical considerations were suggested by either the plaintiff or the defendants. Because of the history of the controversy, the court entertained the motion as the parties presented it, namely, on the sole issue whether the circumstances had so changed that the best interests of the child warranted a further modification of the judgment. Two reports, one dated October 27, 1955, and the other January 6, 1956, were made part of the finding. These reports had been considered by the court before the original judgment awarding the custody of Keli to the defendants was rendered on February 9, 1956. It was stated in the first report that the plaintiff then occupied a three-room apartment on the second floor of a house in Thomaston, that a young man who had pleaded guilty to the crime of statutory rape occupied a room on the same floor, and that the plaintiff intended, if custody of Keli was awarded to her, to have Keli live in her apartment. In the other report, it was noted that the immediate environment in which the plaintiff then lived was "not the most favorable one to bring up a child who is about to enter adolescence." No claim was made that the plaintiff was an unfit person to have custody of her daughter.
*108 The plaintiff now lives in Thomaston, where she has conducted nursing courses for "teen-age" girls. She is active on the local library board and in the parent-teacher association and the local Red Cross, and is very highly regarded. She is employed as an industrial nurse in Thomaston and during the 1955 flood served twenty-four hours a day, nursing, and assisting doctors in emergency activities. She moved into her present home in August, 1956, subsequent to her court appearance in this action in June, 1956. She occupies five rooms on the first floor of a tenroom house located in one of the older, well-established areas of Thomaston on a main state highway. The house

*875 24. There are simply too many circumstances which could occur which are out of the control of the Bankruptcy Court or the Trustee, or both, "such as an ill or vacationing bankruptcy judge who is unable to act on a timely-filed motion within the 30 day period . . . or a motion that is filed on the thirtieth day, minutes after the bankruptcy judge has gone home . . ." Laurain, 113 F.3d at 602. The list of other possible impediments to the actual entry of an order under a literal reading of Bankruptcy Rule 4003(b) ranges from vacations to holidays to natural disasters and the like. These impediments are often out of the control of the Court and the Trustee. The authority of this Court to grant a timely filed motion for extension under Bankruptcy Rule 4003(b) serves to eliminate the undue hardship on both trustees and the court which would flow from the literal interpretation urged by the Debtor. See, Statner, 212 B.R. at 167.
25. This Court's interpretation of Bankruptcy rule 4003(b) will serve to eliminate or substantially reduce the need for the plethora of pleadings, oppositions, memoranda, supplemental citations of authority, hearings and requests for rehearing which, as amply demonstrated by the instant case, will necessarily result from the strict and literal interpretation urged by the Debtor.
26. Indeed, there is not better case that the present case to illustrate the need for a Trustee to have ample time to investigate the affairs of a Debtor who, despite his protestations to the contrary, may not be as forthcoming as might otherwise be expected or desired, or alternatively, who has embarked on a purposeful course of opposition to virtually all of the Trustee's investigatory efforts. It would be manifestly unfair to the Trustee and inequitable to the creditors whose interests are entrusted to the Trustee, to permit a Debtor to enjoy the "fortuitous and inequitable results" of an escape with his otherwise questionable exemptions intact, upon the technical and narrow reading of the rule which is urged by the Debtor. See, In re Statner, 212 B.R. 164, 167 (Bkrtcy.S.D.Fla. 1997).
27. This Court will not impose upon Trustees or the Court the heavy and otherwise unnecessary burden of the rote and mechanical filing of extension motions upon the completion of the creditors' meeting, for the sole purpose of ensuring that the entry of an order occurs within the thirty (30) day period following

MEMORANDUM
ROBERT L. TAYLOR, District Judge.
This is a petition to review the final decision of the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare which approved the decision of the Hearing Examiner denying that plaintiff was under a disability as defined by the Social Security Act either before or after the 1967 Amendments. Plaintiff meets the special earnings requirements at least through December 31, 1970.
He was born on July 30, 1923, and testified that he had a fifth grade education. He has had various jobs ranging from manual labor to supervisory work. Some of his jobs have been lumberyard work, drill press operator, assembly line work for General Motors, and finally work as a maintenance man in a supervisory position in San Diego, California.
He filed his initial application for disability benefits on October 17, 1966, alleging disability from June 6, 1966. His chief complaints were diabetes, arthritis, and a possible heart condition. He testified that he suffered a heart attack in 1965, and blackouts due to insulin reactions. He is presently taking eight different types of medicine in addition to insulin.
He was contacted by an Administration official on October 17, 1966, and stated that he went into a diabetic coma in 1957 and has been on insulin since that time. He had to give up work because of dizzy spells. At the interview he exhibited no difficulty in walking or in the use of his hands and arms.
In another contact report dated February 16 and 17, 1967, it is stated that he sees a doctor once or twice a week, and that the doctor wanted to increase his insulin but plaintiff refused because of fear of insulin shock. The doctor told him to stay on his diet and take his medicine, but did not advise him not to work or restrict him in any way. He is able to shower and dress without aid, and cleans around his bed as well as making it up. He continues to perform Class II duties at the VA Center, including carrying folders to doctors and stamping papers.
Doctor Roscoe S. Pryse, general practitioner, has been seeing him since July, 1966. On October 17, 1966, Dr. Pryse diagnosed diabetes mellitus, arthritis, *539 schizophrenia, hypertension, and arteriosclerotic heart disease (ASHD). It is noted that Dr. Pryse made no clinical tests and found plaintiff essentially normal except for an irregular heart and appearing nervous and shaky.
A Veterans Administration Hospital report, signed by Dr. Martin Kerlan, stated that he was

State, 459 So.2d 1098 at 1100, n. 2 (Fla. 1st DCA 1984). Further, the Second District, in State v. Viamari, 462 So.2d 1154, 1155, n. 1 (Fla. 2d DCA 1984), stated that "[b]ecause the supreme court does not adopt or approve the comments, we feel that said comments are merely `helpful hints' to attorneys and are not binding." Indeed, the "Comments" have apparently never been printed in either the supreme court opinions adopting the amendments to the guidelines since 1983, nor in the Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure, but have appeared only in the original 1983 Sentencing Guidelines Manual.
Defendant's trial attorney, Mr. Norton, objected to the use of the revised scoresheet at the sentencing hearing and argued (1) that the recalculation according to the Commission's memorandum resulted in an ex post facto application of the amended rules and (2) that defendant's plea of guilty was based specifically upon Mr. Norton's reliance on the "Comment" appearing in the manual. We decline to address the defendant's ex post facto argument regarding the Commission's change in the unofficial Comment. We do feel, however, that the calculation of prior misdemeanor convictions as same-category offenses is improper, regardless of the unofficial status of the Comment.
There are several factors which we consider in reaching this conclusion. First is the fact that the sentencing guidelines themselves apply only to felonies. Section 921.001(4)(a), Florida Statutes. Indeed, the sentencing guidelines scoresheets for each of the nine offense categories enumerated in Rule 3.701(c), Fla.R.Crim.P., allow for the calculation of felonies only. Misdemeanors cannot be scored as primary offenses at conviction. Rule 3.701(c) breaks the offenses to which the guidelines apply into nine categories. The language of the rule in describing Category 9 as "[a]ll other felony offenses" could be read to imply that the preceding 8 categories encompass only felonies. Further, the supreme court has recently approved the adoption of the original Comment to Rule 3.701(d)(5) as an official rule. The Florida Bar: Amendment to Rules of Criminal Procedure (3.701, 3.988  Sentencing Guidelines), 468 So.2

      Salazar’s assertion that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable
because the district court misapprehended his objection to the U.S.S.G.
§ 2K2.1(b)(4)(A) enhancement is disingenuous, as he never asked the district
court to vary from the calculated guidelines range, and the record does not
show that the district court erroneously believed it could not depart
downwardly. See United States v. Hernandez, 457 F.3d 416, 424 & n.5 (5th
Cir. 2006).    Further, the district court considered all of the evidence and
arguments before it and had a reasoned basis for exercising its decisionmaking
authority. See Rita v. United States, 551 U.S. 338, 356 (2007); United States
v. Diaz Sanchez, 714 F.3d 289, 293-95 (5th Cir. 2013). Salazar fails to show
that his sentence was substantively unreasonable as he has not rebutted the
presumption we accord his within-guidelines sentence. See United States v.
Mondragon-Santiago, 564 F.3d 357, 360 (5th Cir. 2009). He, therefore, fails to
show plain error with respect to the procedural or substantive reasonableness
of his sentence. See Puckett, 536 U.S. at 135.

MEMORANDUM DECISION

        {¶1}     Plaintiff, Tricia Porter, filed this action against defendant, Department of
Transportation (ODOT), contending her 2007 Chevrolet Cobalt was damaged as a
proximate result of negligence on the part of ODOT personnel in maintaining a
hazardous condition on US Route 22 in Jefferson County. In her complaint, plaintiff
provided a narrative description of her damage event recording she was traveling east
on US Route 22 when “my car went into huge pothole that was in the road which
caused my left driver side tire to go flat and off the rim.” Plaintiff recalled the particular
damage incident occurred on January 31, 2011 at approximately 6:35 a.m. Plaintiff
requested damages in the amount of $303.87, the total cost of replacement parts. The
$25.00 filing fee was paid and plaintiff requested reimbursement of that cost along with
her damage claim.
        {¶2}     Defendant denied liability based on the contention that no ODOT
personnel had any knowledge of the particular damage-causing pothole prior to
plaintiff’s January 31, 2011 described occurrence.                     Defendant located the pothole
“between mileposts 14.93 and 15.02 on US 22 in Jefferson County.”                               Defendant
explained ODOT records show no reports of a pothole on US Route 22 in the vicinity of
plaintiff’s incident prior to January 31, 2011. Defendant argued plaintiff did not provide
any evidence to establish the length of time the particular pothole was present on the
roadway prior to January 31, 2011.         Defendant suggested, “it is likely the pothole
existed for only a short time before the incident.”
       {¶3}    Furthermore, defendant contended plaintiff did not offer any evidence to
prove the roadway was negligently maintained. Defendant related the ODOT “Jefferson
County Manager inspects all state roadways within the county at least two times a
month.” Apparently, no potholes were discovered in the vicinity of plaintiff’s incident on
US 22 the last time that section of roadway was inspected prior to January 31, 2011.
Defendant’s maintenance records show potholes were patched in the vicinity of
plaintiff’s incident on January 13, 2011, January 18, 2011,

 SHINN, J.
 Appeal by plaintiff from a judgment on a directed verdict for defendant. It was alleged in the complaint that plaintiff, a real estate broker, had been engaged by one Epstein to find a purchaser for certain real estate and personal property belonging to Epstein and was to receive a commission of 5 per cent of the first $115,000 of the selling price and 50 per cent of any additional sum received for the property. It was alleged that plaintiff procured defendant as a purchaser, that defendant entered into a written agreement with Epstein to purchase the property for $125,000, and that defendant repudiated the agreement and refused to conclude the purchase. The prayer of the complaint was for damages in the sum of $10,750. The answer admitted the making of the contract of purchase, denied that defendant had repudiated it, and alleged that he had rescinded the contract for good cause.
 Plaintiff offered in evidence an agreement by which Epstein appointed him exclusive agent to find a purchaser for the property. It was excluded from evidence upon defendant's *607 objection. It was not offered for identification and is not contained in the record. We may assume, as counsel do, that it conformed to the agreement alleged in the complaint, which described the property to be sold as "a building, bowling alley, cafe, cocktail room, licenses, good will, fixtures, equipment, and merchandise." The agreement of sale, hereinafter referred to, shows that the land also was included. The complaint alleged that under the employment agreement, "said Morris Epstein agreed to pay to the Plaintiff as commission for his securing a purchaser for said property five per cent (5%) of $115,000.00, plus 50% of all the amounts received by Epstein in excess of $115,000 for the sale of the aforementioned property."
 The agreement between Epstein and defendant was in the form of escrow instructions, copy of which was attached to defendant's answer, and the agreement as pleaded was received in evidence. Defendant moved for a directed verdict upon the ground that plaintiff had not proved any agreement in writing subscribed by defendant, employing plaintiff to purchase the property for compensation or a commission, as required by section 1624(5) of the Civil Code, and a direction to the jury to return a verdict for defendant followed the granting of that motion.
 Plaintiff, while conceding that it was necessary for him to prove a written agreement of employment subscrib

Lee Allen Jones appeals from a final judgment entered in the District Court1 for the Eastern District of Missouri upon jury verdicts for defendants Collier and Mendoza and against Jones on a 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 complaint against the correctional officers.  There were two trials in the district court--the first trial resulted in a verdict for Collier and a mistrial as to defendant Mendoza;  the second trial resulted in a verdict for Mendoza.FACTS


6
On June 29, 1982, Officers Collier and Mendoza and another correctional officer transported three prisoners to the St. Louis County Hospital.  Each officer was assigned to one prisoner, each prisoner wore a chain around his waist to which he was handcuffed, and the officers were armed.  While waiting in the security room at the hospital, a situation arose wherein Officer Mendoza and Mr. Jones came to blows.  Mr. Jones contended before the jury that Mendoza, for no good cause, attacked and beat him.  Officer Mendoza contended that Jones, after Mendoza asked him a question, became belligerent and attacked Mendoza, grabbing Mendoza's coat and tie.  Mendoza further contended it was necessary to strike Jones to cause him to release his grasp.


7
At the first trial, Michael Hill, one of the prisoners in the County Hospital waiting room, testified that he did not see Jones grab Mendoza's coat or tie.  At the second trial he testified he was not sure.  Counsel for the plaintiff moved at the second trial, the next court day following Hill's testimony, that Hill should be recalled to the stand for rebuttal or, alternatively, that the trial should be delayed so that a transcript could be prepared of his testimony at the first trial and read to the jury.  Plaintiff's counsel failed to rebut Hill's testimony when he was on the stand or even attempt to lay grounds for rebuttal.  Hill was at the time of the request some 300 miles away in state prison.  The district court denied the plaintiff's motion.


8
At both trials, the defense attorney moved that evidence of plaintiff's prior convictions not be admitted in to evidence.  The district court denied the motion both times.  Notwithstanding his efforts to exclude such evidence from the trial of case, in the second trial plaintiff's attorney introduced the evidence of

ANALYSIS

6
To the extent that the Employees' claims were state law claims they were obviously preempted.   Lingle v. Norge Div. of Magic Chef, Inc., 486 U.S. 399, 403 (1988).   However, on the face of the complaint itself, the claims were made under the collective bargaining agreements and were federal claims.   Even if the complaint could be construed as initially stating state claims, the plaintiffs were free to recharacterize their suit as one arising under § 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act.   Ghebreselassie v. Coleman Security Service, 829 F.2d 892 (9th Cir.1987).


7
On appeal, GTE argues that we may affirm, not on the basis of preemption, but on the grounds that the Employees failed to allege that they exhausted the remedies available under the collective bargaining agreements.   We are free to affirm on any ground visible in the record and we affirm on this ground.


8
The agreement between Local Union 89 IBEW and GTE, Article VIII sets out a grievance procedure for any "alleged violation of the contractual relationship between employer and employee" and provides that the failure of either party to meet the time limits set will result in the default.   Article IX further provides for arbitration if there is a difference of opinion as to the interpretation of the agreement.   Federal labor policy "requires that individual employees wishing to assert contract grievances must attempt use of a contract grievance procedure agreed upon by employer and union as the mode of redress."   Republic Steel v. Maddox, 379 U.S. 650, 652 (1965) (emphasis in original).   Nothing in the plaintiffs' complaint indicates that they took the steps required for grievance or arbitration.   Nowhere in the complaint is there a reference to use of the remedies provided by the collective bargaining agreements.   The allegation of the Employees that they have "duly performed all conditions required of them under the agreements" refers to their right to recover the per diem allowance and does not refer to compliance with the grievance procedure set up by the collective bargaining agreements.


9
Pleading in the federal courts is not a game, and courts construe pleadings liberally so as to do substantial justice.   Lynn v. Sheet Metal Workers' International Ass'n, 804 F.2d 1472, 1482 (9th Cir.1986).   The Employees have studiously avoided stating that they complied

1
The district court dismissed an appeal from the bankruptcy court because the appellant's brief was not filed within 15 days after entry of the appeal and, indeed, had not yet been filed 19 1/2 months later when the appeal was dismissed.  Finding no abuse of discretion, we affirm.


2
This appeal to the district court from a bankruptcy court order was filed on September 14, 1983.  Although Bankruptcy Rule 8009 requires the appellant to serve and file his brief within 15 days after entry of the appeal, no further action was taken.  Upon inquiry by the district court on April 30, 1985, to determine the status of the case, the appellant's lawyer expressed the belief his brief had been filed.  The lawyer checked his file and found the brief there, undelivered to the court.  No copy had been served upon or mailed to the appellee.  The district court dismissed the appeal because no explanation had been given for appellant's failure either to file a brief or to monitor the case.


3
Under more egregious facts, we affirmed the dismissal of a bankruptcy appeal for failure timely to file a brief in Pyramid Mobile Homes, Inc. v. Speake,1 saying that, while "we fully recognize that indiscriminate exercise of the dismissal power for [such] derelictions ... may punish the innocent client for the unprofessional conduct of his counsel,"2 "time is of the essence" in bankruptcy proceedings and this court should review the district court's action with attention to "the prejudicial effect of delay on the appellees and the bona fides of the appellant."3


4
There is no issue concerning the good faith of either the appellant or its counsel, but the delay in considering the appeal might well be prejudicial to the appellee and others.  The appeal to the district court concerned the bankruptcy court's disallowance of counterclaims against the former officers and directors of the

Appeal from a decision of the Workers' Compensation Board, filed January 9, 2019, which ruled, among other things, that the award of counsel fees was payable out of claimant's schedule loss of use award and not out of the employer's reimbursement credit.
Claimant, a correction officer, injured his right knee while undergoing physical training at the New York State Correctional Services Training Academy. He was out of work for a period of time following this incident and filed a claim for workers' compensation benefits. His claim was established for a right knee injury and his average weekly wage was set. During the time that claimant was out of work, his employer, the State, paid him his regular wages and filed a claim for reimbursement with the Workers' Compensation Board.
In November 2017, the Board issued an administrative decision that awarded claimant benefits made payable as a credit to the employer to partially reimburse it for wages that it had paid to claimant while he was out of work. At claimant's request, the Board issued an amended administrative decision identical to the first, but included an award of counsel fees of $700 made payable as a lien on the employer's reimbursement credit, effectively reducing that credit.
Following additional proceedings on the permanency of claimant's condition, the Board found that claimant had a 20% schedule loss of use of the right leg, made an award, less payments already made, and indicated that the employer's reimbursement credit was "less [the] prior attorney's fee

jurisdiction or is wholly insubstantial and frivolous.‘‖ Id. at 186–87 (quoting Arbaugh v.

Y & H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 513 n.10 (2006)).

       Martinez argues that the BIA erred in relying upon three cases from other circuits,

Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, 357 F.3d 169 (2d Cir. 2004), Rashiah v. Ashcroft, 388 F.3d

1126 (7th Cir. 2004), and Almaghzar v. Gonzales, 457 F.3d 915 (9th Cir. 2006), that

were cited in support of the BIA‘s statement that ―[e]vidence of the possibility of torture

generally, does not meet the standard of establishing that it is more likely than not that a

particular alien would be targeted for such treatment.‖ A.R. 4. Martinez contends that

these cases prescribe an analytical framework for CAT claims that conflicts with our own

precedent, Berishaj v. Ashcroft, 378 F.3d 314 (3d Cir. 2004).

       We disagree. Martinez suggests that the Ramsameachire was cited for the

proposition that CAT claims have an objective component which conflicts with our
                                              3
holding that ―CAT claims are entirely concerned with the objective likelihood of torture.‖

Berishaj, 378 F.3d at 332. This is simply incorrect: the BIA unambiguously cited

Ramsameachire for the proposition that an ―IJ must determine whether someone in the

alien‘s particular circumstances is more likely than not to be tortured.‖ A.R. 4.

Moreover, Ramsmeachire‘s holding that ―to prevail on a CAT claim the alien need only

proffer objective evidence [establishing] that he or she is likely to be tortured in the

future,‖ 357 F.3d at 185, is entirely consistent with our jurisprudence. See Berishaj, 378

F.3d at 332. Rashiah and Almaghzar also do not conflict with our precedent in any

relevant respect. Martinez argues that in contrast to Almaghzar, Berishaj requires

consideration of the frequency with which torture occurs to determine eligibility for relief

under the CAT. This

Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. ___, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004),

arguably has been abandoned. See United States v. Stinson, 97 F.3d 466, 470 n.2

(11th Cir. 1996) (declining to reach an issue that the defendant abandoned by not

raising it in his initial brief). Even if this court construed Richardson’s fact-based

challenged to his sentence as also implicitly presenting a constitutional claim for

the first time on appeal, such a claim would be reviewable only for plain error.

See Booker, 543 U.S. at ___, 125 S.Ct. at 769.

       An appellate court may not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in

the district court unless there is: “(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects

substantial rights.” United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625, 631, 122 S.Ct. 1781,

1785, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002) (quotations and internal marks omitted). “If all

three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to

notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness,

integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.” Id. (quotations and

internal marks omitted).

       No plain error exists in this case because the first prong of the test is not

satisfied. The guidelines system concerning revocation of supervised release

under which Richardson’s sentence was imposed is advisory, not mandatory. See

Aguillard, 217 F.3d at 1320 (“chapter 7 guidelines are merely advisory”). Thus,

there was no Booker error. Moreover, persuasive authority from the Second

Circuit has held that remand was not necessary in a revocation case in which a

two-year sentence was imposed upon revocation of supervised release because,

even though the revocation sentence was imposed pre-Booker, the district court, as

Judgment, Supreme Court, New York County (Shlomo Hagler, J.), entered February 2, 2016, awarding plaintiffs the total sum of $240,123.23, unanimously affirmed, without costs.
This action for personal injuries was referred to a Special Referee for an inquest and report on the issue of damages. Defendant 545 West 146th Street, Inc. (defendant) waived its right to object to entry of the plastic surgeon's report, dated August 11, 2008, as a business record, as it is undisputed that plaintiffs served it with notice of their intention to enter the document into evidence, and defendant failed to object, as required by CPLR 3122-a(c) (see Siemucha v Garrison, 111 AD3d 1398, 1400 [4th Dept 2013]; Streicker v Adir Rent A Car, 279 AD2d 385 [1st Dept 2001]).
Defendant's failure to comply with CPLR 3122-a did not prevent it from objecting to the report's admissibility based on other rules of evidence (see Bostic v State of New York, 232 AD2d 837 [1996], lv denied 89 NY2d 807 [1997]). However, defendant's objection that the plastic surgeon's report was not admissible because it was prepared for the purpose of litigation and was not germane to diagnosis and the child's treatment is not preserved for appellate review (see Benavides v City of New York, 115 AD3d 518, 519 [1st Dept 2014]; Braunstein v Taj Group of Hotels, 235 AD2d 370 [1st Dept 1997], lv denied 89 NY2d 816 [1997]).

PER CURIAM.

         Willie H. Williams appeals the November 30, 2006, decision of the United States

Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans Court). 1 That decision affirmed an April

24, 2004, decision of the Board of Veterans’ Appeals that there was no clear and

unmistakable error in a 1962 rating decision denying Mr. Williams service connection for

a psychiatric disability. We dismiss the appeal.

         On appeal, Mr. Williams argues that the Veterans Court misinterpreted 38 U.S.C.

*522 Paul A. Simmons, with him Tempest & Simmons, for appellant.
No argument was made nor brief submitted for appellee.
OPINION BY MR. JUSTICE JONES, March 22, 1966:
Sarah Thornton (testatrix), by will, devised: (1) property located at 416 Marne Avenue, Monongahela, known as Lot 1, to her daughter, Eugenia T. Dumas; (2) property located at 508 Marne Avenue, Monongahela, known as Lot 2, to her son, Junius Thornton; (3) property located at 90 Third Avenue, Monongahela, known as Lot 3, to her grandson, Norman Thornton,[1] for life and, upon his death, the remainder to his two children, Gertrude and Michael Thornton.[2]
Testatrix' personal estate was insufficient to pay her debts and administration expenses and it became necessary to sell testatrix' three pieces of realty; such realty was sold with court permission. After the payment of testatrix' debts and administration expenses and at the audit of the estate, the question was raised whether, under § 751(2) of the Fiduciaries Act of 1949,[3] the gift to testatrix' grandson, Norman Thornton, and his children should be abated in favor of the gifts to testatrix' children, Eugenia Dumas and Junius Thornton.
The Orphans' Court of Washington County decreed that the amount necessary for the payment of testatrix' debts and administration expenses should be *523 pro rated between the three devisees in proportion to the ratio of the prices received for each property separately at the sales to the total amount received from all sales.

PER CURIAM:

     Ricky A. Walker seeks to appeal the district court's order de-

nying relief on his motion for transcripts, petition filed under 28

U.S.C.A. § 2254 (West 1994 & Supp. 1999), and motion filed under

Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).   We have reviewed the record and the dis-

trict court's opinions and find no reversible error.   Accordingly,

we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal on

the reasoning of the district court.   See Walker v. Conroy, No. CA-

99-236-AMD (D. Md. July 14, Aug. 24, & Sept. 7, 1999).*     We dis-

pense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions

are adequately presented in the materials before the court and

argument would not aid the decisional process.

       Although the district court's order denying the Rule 59(e)

court's records show that the order was entered on the docket sheet

1
We have consolidated two related appeals which raise questions of first impression with regard to the awarding of attorney's fees under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. Secs. 901 et seq.    The nominal plaintiffs in the two cases are injured longshoremen who were represented by attorney Ernest Rossiello in administrative actions against their employer and the employer's insurance carrier (the defendants) to obtain benefits under the Act.  Rossiello succeeded in getting some benefits for each of the plaintiffs;  those benefits have been paid in full;  and the plaintiffs have no pecuniary interest in the district court proceedings from which these appeals arise.  These proceedings just involve Rossiello's claims for attorney's fees against the defendants.


2
The Act provides that if the employer or carrier denies liability and the claimant obtains a lawyer's services "in the successful prosecution of his claim, there shall be awarded, in addition to the award of compensation [to the claimant], in a compensation order, a reasonable attorney's fee against the employer or carrier in the amount approved by the [Department of Labor's] deputy commissioner, [Benefits Review] Board, or court, as the case may be, which shall be paid directly ... to the attorney ... in a lump sum after the compensation order becomes final."    33 U.S.C. Sec. 928(a).  After the deputy commissioner awarded benefits to Rossiello

                                Nos. 14-30398, 14-30400
16(a)(2). This argument must also be rejected based on the terms of that
provision, which have a “well-established meaning” illuminated by the case
law analyzing the nearly identical language of 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). 10 As the
First, 11 Second, 12 Ninth, 13 and Federal Circuits have all held, “an order that
‘continues’ an injunction . . . is an order that extends the duration of the
injunction that would otherwise have dissolved by its own terms.” 14 But where
an order does “not prolong, extend, or in any other way impact the duration of
the . . . injunction,” that order “cannot be characterized as ‘continuing’ the . . .
injunction” and therefore is not appealable. 15
       In the present case, the district court’s orders of March 26, 2014, did not
prolong, extend, or in any other way impact the duration of the injunction
ordered by this court on October 2, 2013, in Deepwater Horizon, 732 F.3d at
345-46. The district court’s orders simply explained the effects of that pre-
existing injunction. As we held in Frazar v. Hawkins, 376 F.3d 444, 447 (5th
Cir. 2004) (quoting Ingram Towing Co., 59 F.3d 513, 516 (5th Cir. 1995)), an
order that merely “enforces or interprets a previous injunction” does not give
rise to interlocutory appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1).
Neither Whitehead nor Rocon identify any reason that the result should be
different under the nearly identical language of 9 U.S.C. § 16(a)(2).
       Accordingly, interpreting the terms of the FAA’s jurisdictional provisions


       10 See Green Tree Fin. Corp.-Alabama v. Randolph, 531 U.S. 79, 86 (2000) (“Because
the FAA does not define [a certain term under 9 U.S.C. § 16] or otherwise suggest that the
ordinary meaning of [this term] should not apply, we accord the term its well-established
meaning.”).

Collateral estoppel applies if (1) the issue decided in the prior case is identical to one presented in the later case; (2) there was a final judgment on the merits; (3) the party against whom the plea is asserted was a party or in privity with a party in the prior case; (4) the party or person privy to the party against whom the doctrine is asserted had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the prior proceeding and (5) the determination in the prior proceeding was essential to the judgment.
See also, Derry Township School District v. Day & Zimmerman, Inc., 345 Pa.Super. 487, 498 A.2d 928 (1985); Zarnecki v. Shepegi, 367 Pa.Super. 230, 532 A.2d 873 (1987).
Collateral estoppel is also referred to as "issue preclusion". Phillip v. Clark, 385 Pa.Super. 229, 560 A.2d 777 (1989). It is a broader concept than res judicata and operates to prevent a question of law or issue of fact which has once been litigated and fully determined in a court of competent jurisdiction from being relitigated in a subsequent suit. Alberici v. Tinari, 374 Pa.Super. 20, 542 A.2d 127 (1988).
In the instant matter, the doctrine was properly applied. The arbitration panel was called on to determine the issue of liability and also the amount of damages suffered by Mr. Incollingo as a result of the accident, including his loss of future earnings. The arbitrators found that the unknown *357 operator of a vehicle which suddenly stopped was liable to the insured and awarded damages to him in the amount of $70,000.00. The issue of damages was fully presented to the arbitrators. Mr. Incollingo testified concerning personal injuries he suffered, his medical treatment and doctors consulted, the effect on his family life, his partial disability, and his lost past and future earnings in connection with the operation of his business as a tree surgeon. Counsel for Mr. Incollingo stated, inter alia, in closing argument to the arbitrators:
If he [the operator of the unidentified vehicle] is responsible, then the carrier is responsible to pay Mr. Incollingo for his injuries. And he's got severe disability injuries. The report indicates that his lost of future income is three hundred and some thousand dollars that he's going to lose, and

Plaintiff Charles M. Hart, a state district court judge in Butler County, seeks *1114 to be a candidate for re-election in 2008. In order to qualify as a candidate, he requires, a sufficient number of voters sign a nomination petition. In 2004, JEAP issued advisory opinion JE 117, declaring that a judicial candidate may not seek signatures for a nomination petition under the Solicitation Clause. Neither the Commission nor the Kansas Supreme Court has addressed JE 117 or the Solicitation Clause. Hart proposes to go door-to-door to collect these signatures, but will not do so because he fears discipline pursuant to the Solicitation Clause.

D
On May 24, 2006, KJR, Rumsey, and Hart filed a complaint against the Commission in federal district court, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief, and a motion for preliminary injunction. They requested that enforcement of the Pledges, Commits, and Solicitation Clauses be enjoined as being unconstitutionally overbroad and vague, and chilling candidates' political speech, thereby restricting the free exchange of views between candidates and potential voters. Additionally, plaintiffs argued that the Clauses were unconstitutional as applied to them. In response, the Commission asserted that KJR lacked standing to sue, this preenforcement challenge was not ripe, and the clauses were constitutional. It also requested certification of a question of state law to the Kansas Supreme Court, namely whether the Pledges and Commits Clauses function as the kind of prohibition on announcements struck down by the United States Supreme Court in White, 536 U.S. 765, 122 S.Ct. 2528, 153 L.Ed.2d 694.
After a hearing, the district court granted a preliminary injunction as to the Pledges, Commits, and Solicitation Clauses, and denied the remaining requests.[6] The district court found that, despite not being subject to the Canons, KJR had standing to challenge them and that plaintiffs' claims were ripe for review. It also found that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims that the Clauses were unconstitutional and that the other preliminary injunction factors weighed in their favor. The Commission filed a timely notice of appeal.
On October 6, 2006, the district court denied both of the Commission's motions, for a stay of the injunction pending appeal and for certification of a question of state law to the Kansas Supreme Court. On November 3, 2006, a panel of this court granted the Commission's motion

        “Michigan courts have defined ‘domicile’ to mean the place where a person has his true,
fixed, permanent home, and principal establishment, and to which, whenever he is absent, he has
the intention of returning.” Id. at 493 (citation and quotation marks omitted). “Similarly, a
person’s domicile has been defined to be that place where a person has voluntarily fixed his abode
not for a mere special or temporary purpose, but with a present intention of making it his home,
either permanently or for an indefinite or unlimited length of time.” Id. “[A] person may have
only one domicile, but more than one residence.” Id. at 494. When determining whether a relative
is “domiciled in the same household” as an insured, the following factors can be considered:

       (1) the subjective or declared intent of the person of remaining, either permanently
       or for an indefinite or unlimited length of time, in the place he contends is his
       “domicile” or “household”; (2) the formality or informality of the relationship
       between the person and the members of the household; (3) whether the place where
       the person lives is in the same house, within the same curtilage or upon the same
       premises; (4) the existence of another place of lodging by the person alleging
       “residence” or “domicile” in the household[.] [Workman v Detroit Auto Inter–Ins
       Exchange, 404 Mich 477, 496-497; 274 NW2d 373 (1979) (citations omitted).]

       With respect to the first factor, plaintiff testified at her deposition that when she stayed
with Aldridge in August 2016, she had no intention to divorce her husband. She just needed some
space because she and her husband had been arguing. Plaintiff testified that whenever she and her
husband would have a fight, she would “go to [her] son’s house until me and him could talk it out,
and I’d go home.” Plaintiff testified that she has thus stayed on and off with her son at least five

MEMORANDUM AND ORDER
FOREMAN, Chief Judge:
Before the Court is third-party defendant, Sherri Duensing's motion to dismiss the third-party complaint (Document No. 32).
Clint Duensing brought this negligence action on behalf of his daughter Amy Duensing for damages incurred when an automobile driven by the defendant, Michael Tripp, struck Amy. The defendant filed a third-party complaint seeking contribution from Sherri Duensing, Amy's mother, alleging that Amy's injuries resulted in part from Sherri's negligent supervision of Amy. On October 29, 1984, this Court dismissed the third-party complaint. (See Duensing v. Tripp, 596 F.Supp. 389 (S.D. Ill.1984). In its memorandum and order the Court noted that a defendant could seek contribution only from those who were liable to the plaintiff for the same injury. From this the Court reasoned that the proper approach to employ to decide the issue was to first ascertain whether or not Illinois would recognize a tort of negligent supervision upon which to premise liability, and second, if such a tort existed, whether parental immunity would defeat liability. The Court proceeded to hold that Illinois would not recognize a tort of negligent supervision.
On November 19, 1984, the defendant asked the Court to reconsider this ruling, arguing that paragraph (b) of the third-party *767 complaint did not sound in negligent supervision. The Court disagreed, but granted the defendant leave to amend the third-party complaint to conform to the recent case of Moon by Moon v. Thompson, 127 Ill.App.3d 657, 82 Ill.Dec. 831, 469 N.E.2d 365 (1984). The defendant amended his third-party complaint repleading paragraphs (a) through (c) and adding paragraph (d) which alleged that Sherri Duensing authorized or permitted her daughter, Amy, to cross the street other than in the crosswalk without yielding the right-of-way to vehicles. Sherri Duensing has now moved to dismiss the amended third party complaint contending that paragraphs (a) through (c) have already been

                    Sufficiency of the Evidence

     Miller argues that the evidence was insufficient to support

his conviction because Garst's testimony was "inherently

unbelievable."   He argues that Garst did not have an independent

recollection of the transaction and that during questioning Garst

exhibited some confusion regarding the details of the transaction.

     On review of a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence,

we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the

Commonwealth and grant to it all reasonable inferences fairly

witnesses and the weight accorded the evidence are matters solely

          To sustain a conviction of larceny by false
          pretenses, the Commonwealth must prove:
          (a) that the accused intended to defraud;
          (b) that a fraud actually occurred; (c) that
          the accused used false pretenses to
          perpetrate the fraud; and (d) that the false
          pretenses induced the owner to part with his
          property.

       Evidence of Defendant’s flight from the scene of the altercation and his
       subsequent disposition of the weapon was competent evidence of the
       consciousness of guilt. Also, it is a matter, generally, for the trier of the
       facts to determine what weight and value should be given to such evidence.
       Nevertheless, the flight of an accused is a circumstance to be considered
       against him only in connection with other evidence . . . . We have
       previously held that flight alone will not support a conviction . . . .

*105 In the states of Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Texas, and Washington, it is clear that their state courts have allowed appellate counsel to withdraw on a wholesale basis. Typical of such procedure is that found in Illinois where, after the motion to withdraw has been filed by the appointed counsel, a copy of the brief is sent to the defendant and he is given 30 days from the time of its receipt to file any further or additional points or authorities. From an examination of the Illinois cases, it is clear that seldom, if ever, does the defendant reply, and the court then proceeds to affirm the decision in a short opinion. It should be noted, however, that in all jurisdictions except Wisconsin, the conviction of the defendant is affirmed by written opinion which points out why that particular appeal has no merit. In Wisconsin, while applying the Anders doctrine, the court initially issues an unpublished per curiam opinion affirming the conviction; if the defendant then files his own brief, the pro se brief is considered and usually rejected by written opinion answering those issues raised by the defendant. (See State v. Herfel (1971) 49 Wis.2d 513, 182 N.W.2d 232).
Three jurisdictions have specifically rejected the procedure set down in Anders v. California supra, and instead hold that an appellate counsel should not seek to withdraw from a case simply because he feels the appeal would be frivolous.
The State of Utah in State v. Cheelester (1971) 26 Utah 2d 300, 488 P.2d 1045, simply rejected the procedure as laid down in Anders with no explanation nor reasoning to justify its decision.
The second jurisdiction to reject the Anders doctrine was Colorado. In McClendon v. People (1971) 481 P.2d 715 the Supreme Court of Colorado which, when presented with the question of when the Public Defender was required to prosecute an appeal and the duties which accompanied his representation of an indigent, elected to apply the ABA Standards as proposed in "The Prosecution Function and the Defense Function" rather than to follow the Anders doctrine. More specifically, the Colorado Court quoted and adopted the ABA Standards as follows:
"(1) Counsel should not seek to withdraw from a case because of his determination that the appeal lacks merit.
"(2) Counsel should give his client his best professional estimate of the quality of the case and should endeavor to persuade the client to abandon a wholly frivolous appeal, or to eliminate particular contentions that are lacking in any substance.
"(3) If the client wishes to

        (c) The offender’s history of criminal conduct demonstrates
        that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public
        from future crime by the offender.

        {¶11} Here, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the trial court

addressed the requisite statutory findings prescribed by R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) either

at the sentencing hearing or in its judgment entry of conviction and sentence.

Specifically, the trial court stated the following on the record at the sentencing

hearing.

        Considering the presumptions, the joint recommendation, and
        Section 2929.13(D) of the Revised Code,1 it is ordered that the
        Defendant shall serve a stated prison term of 10 years as to
        Count I, which is conspiracy to murder, and five years as to
        Count II with Count II to run consecutive to Count I.

1
  Section 2929.13(D) of the Revised Code addresses the presumption for first degree felonies “that a prison
term is necessary in order to comply with the purposes and principles of sentencing under section 2929.11
of the Revised Code.”

Case No. 17-12-15



(Sentencing Tr. at 11).

       {¶12} In its judgment entry of conviction and sentence, the trial court stated

the following regarding Short’s consecutive sentences.

       The Court has considered the presumptions under Section
       2929.13(D) of the Revised Code. It is therefore ORDERED that
       the Defendant serve a stated prison term of ten (10) years as to
       Count I and five (5) years as to Count II, with Count II to run
       consecutive to Count I.

(Doc. No. 169 at 2).

       {¶13} Based upon our review, we find that there is no clear indication in

the record that the trial court addressed the statutory findings in R.C.

2929.14(C)(4). Therefore, consistent with prior precedent, we conclude that the

trial court’s sentence is clearly and convincingly contrary to law. Notably, the

appellee, the State of Ohio, concedes on appeal that the trial court’s failure to

address the statutory findings is reversible error. Accordingly, Short’s assignment

of error is

ANALYSIS
1. Appellant claims that the trial court erred by denying a post-trial hearing pursuant to Schwartz v. Minneapolis Suburban Bus Co., 258 Minn. 325, 104 N.W.2d 301 (1960). Defendant claims a Schwartz hearing was necessary to determine whether the jurors were biased.
Minn.R.Crim.P. 26.03, subd. 19(6) governs jury deliberations in criminal matters. When defense counsel becomes concerned that the verdict may be impeached, he shall move the court for summary hearing. Minn.R.Crim.P. 26.03, subd. 19(6) provides:
(6) Impeachment of verdict. Affidavits of jurors shall not be received in evidence to impeach their verdict. If the defendant has reason to believe that the verdict is subject to impeachment, he shall move the court for a summary hearing. If the motion is granted, the jurors shall be interrogated under oath and their testimony recorded. The admissibility of evidence at the hearing shall be governed by Rule 606(b) of the Minnesota Rules of Evidence.
The defendant must show actual misconduct resulting in prejudice. State v. Henderson, 355 N.W.2d 484, 486 (Minn.Ct. App.1984). Where a jury has made experiments or taken unauthorized views, through the use of prejudicial evidence, then a mistrial is appropriate. See Olberg v. Minneapolis Gas Co., 291 Minn. 334, 340, 191 N.W.2d 418, 423 (1971). The granting of a Schwartz hearing lies in the discretion of the trial court. State v. Rainer, 411 N.W.2d 490, 498 (Minn.1987).
In Rainer, the Minnesota Supreme Court cited with approval decisions from other jurisdictions holding that experimentation with weapons in evidence and reenactments of incidents by the jury are permissible. Id. at 498-99. In the present case, appellant alleges the jury foreman drew a map of the area of the assault. Appellant alleges the map was certainly not drawn to scale and was most likely misleading or inaccurate. Appellant cites two interviews with jurors which indicate that jurors relied on the map.
Respondent has cited two cases which indicate that a jury's reliance on a map drawn by one of the jurors does not constitute misconduct justifying a new trial. In Wagner v. Doulton, 112 Cal.App.3d 945, 169 Cal.Rptr. 550 (2nd Dist.1980), the

rights were violated when they were denied the opportunity to pursue repapering.

Second, they argue that their application for asylum should have been granted on the

merits.

          The second argument is easily rejected. At the hearing before the IJ, the Jahics

testified regarding their experiences during the 1992 war. As Bosnian Muslims, the

Jahics were harassed, and Sead was subject to brief periods of detention and

interrogation. In addition, the Jahic home was destroyed during the fighting, although the

IJ found that this incident “appeared to be part of the civil fighting in Bosnia, and not

really directed against” the Jahics specifically. App. 124. When the Jahics arrived in the

United States in 1992, a State Department advisory concluded that Sean Jahic had “good

reason to fear for his safety” in Bosnia. App. 18. Nonetheless, during the Jahics’ asylum

hearing in 2003, the IJ noted that the 2003 State Department reports “make clear that the

situation [in Bosnia] has improved drastically and substantially.” App. 125.

          Mr. Jahic testified that if forced to return to Bosnia, “[t]here’s [a] very good

chance we [will] get killed, threatened, can be woman raped or some – you know, you

ORDER
KRUPANSKY, District Judge.
This proceeding has been transmitted to the District Court by the Bankruptcy *1269 Referee for a hearing before a jury at the bankrupt's request and as authorized by § 17a(2) and § 17c(5) of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, to determine the non-dischargeability of certain debts.
The Referee's transmittal was in keeping with the policy of the Judicial Conference of the United States discouraging Referees in Bankruptcy from conducting jury trials. See Report of the Proceedings of the Judicial Conference of the United States, March 1960, at page 22.
The instant case presents two issues to the Court: the bankrupt's right to jury trial; and the conduct of such trial by a Referee. Neither of these two questions have been finally determined by a Court in this Circuit.
Congress has authorized Bankruptcy Referees to determine the dischargeable debts of a bankrupt. 11 U.S.C. § 11. While not expressly granting to the bankrupt the privilege of trial by jury on the issue of discharge, Congress has preserved such right where it preexists. Section 17 of the Bankruptcy Act 11 U. S.C. § 35(c) (5) states:
Nothing in this subdivision shall be deemed to affect the right of any party, upon timely demand, to a trial by jury where such right exists.
Congressional objective in enacting this Title was to secure for creditors as well as bankrupts the efficient and fair administration of estates. Curtis v. Drybrough, 70 F.Supp. 151 (D.C.Ky. 1947). The usual modes of trial attended by necessary delay were disposed of by the enactment insuring prompt and effective administration and settlement of the bankrupt's estate by creating a special forum in which the bankruptcy proceedings could be expeditiously handled. Katchen v. Landy, 382 U.S. 323, 86 S.Ct. 467, 15 L.Ed.2d 391 (1966).
The Bankruptcy Referees are experts, learned in the field of bankruptcy law and skilled in the specialized practice of the Bankruptcy Court. The Referee's Certificate of Transmittal, indicated no delineation of issues requested to be submitted to the jury. This action was initiated by certain creditors to determine the dischargeability of specified debts of the

[¶ 13] Once the children are determined to be deprived, the juvenile court must find the deprivation is "likely to continue or will not be remedied." N.D.C.C. § 27-20-44(1)(b)(1). Irene argues the juvenile court erred in finding clear and convincing evidence that the conditions and causes of her deprivation of her children were likely to continue.
[¶ 14] Irene contends reasonable efforts were not made to reunite her with her children. Reasonable efforts to preserve and reunite families must be made before "the placement of a child in foster care, to prevent or eliminate the need for removing the child from the child's home[,] and [t]o make it possible for a child to return safely to the child's home." N.D.C.C. § 27-20-32.2(2). Under N.D.C.C. § 27-20-32.2(1), "reasonable efforts" is defined as:
[T]he exercise of due diligence, by the agency granted authority over the child . . . to use appropriate and available services to meet the needs of the child and the child's family in order to prevent removal of the child from the child's family or, after removal, to use appropriate and available services to eliminate the need for removal and to reunite the child and the child's family. In determining reasonable efforts to be made with respect to a child . . ., and in making reasonable efforts, the child's health and safety must be the paramount concern.
[¶ 15] In its February 28, 2006, findings of fact, the juvenile court found:
[Social Services] has made reasonable efforts to help prevent removal. Case management and Parent Aide Services were offered to [Irene], and she refused these services. [Irene] agreed to attend counseling at SCHSC, but has not attended since December 1, 2005. [Irene] agreed to ensure that [Andrew] attend therapy as recommended by his therapist, [Andrew] has not attended any therapy sessions since December 7, 2005.
The juvenile court ordered Social Services to "make every reasonable effort to return the children to their parental home" and ordered Irene and Randall to "participate in psychological and parenting capacity evaluations and follow through with recommended treatment" and ordered Irene to "submit to random urine analysis, work with parent aide, and attend parenting classes." In its September 20, 2006, findings of

*377 Discussion

Defendant's primary argument on appeal is that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the second degree kidnapping charges. Defendant maintains that the State presented insufficient evidence of confinement, restraint, or removal separate from that which was inherent in the robbery with a dangerous weapon and, therefore, he cannot be convicted of both offenses under State v. Fulcher, 294 N.C. 503, 523, 243 S.E.2d 338, 351 (1978).
In Fulcher, our Supreme Court stated:
It is self-evident that certain felonies (e.g., forcible rape and armed robbery) cannot be committed without some restraint of the victim. We are of the opinion, and so hold, that G.S. 14-39 was not intended by the Legislature to make a restraint, which is an inherent, inevitable feature of such other felony, also kidnapping so as to permit the conviction and punishment of the defendant for both crimes. To hold otherwise would violate the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. Pursuant to the above mentioned principle of statutory construction, we construe the word "restrain," as used in G.S. 14-39, to connote a restraint separate and apart from that which is inherent in the commission of the other felony.
Id.
The Supreme Court further clarified the "separate act" requirement in State v. Irwin, 304 N.C. 93, 103, 282 S.E.2d 439, 446 (1981), holding that removal of an employee at knife-point from the front to the rear of a pharmacy to open the safe and obtain drugs was "an inherent and integral part of the attempted armed robbery," and, therefore, the removal was legally insufficient to convict the defendant of a separate charge of kidnapping. The Court also noted that the defendant did not expose the victim "to greater danger than that inherent in the armed robbery itself, nor [was the victim] subjected to the kind of danger and abuse the kidnapping statute was designed to prevent." Id. As a result, the Court concluded that the defendant's removal of the victim was "a mere technical asportation" requiring dismissal of the kidnapping charge. Id.
The Court more recently addressed this issue in State v. Ripley, 360 N.C. 333, 626 S.E.2d 289 (2006). In Ripley, the Court held:
[A] trial court, in determining whether a defendant's asportation of a victim during the commission of

The Marking Statute
Patentees must comply with the Marking statute in order to recover damages for infringement. The statute provides in relevant part:
Patentees ... making, offering for sale, or selling ... any patented article ... may give notice to the public that the same is patented, either by fixing thereon the word "patent" or the abbreviation "pat.", together with the number of the patent, or when, from the character of the article, this cannot be done, by fixing to it, or to the package wherein one or more of them is contained, a label containing a like notice. In the event of failure to so mark, no damages shall be recovered by the patentee in any action for infringement, except on proof that the infringer was notified of the infringement and continued to infringe thereafter, in which event damages may be recovered only for infringement occurring after such notice. Filing of an action for infringement shall constitute such notice.
35 U.S.C. § 287(a). Generally, under the marking statute, a party "is entitled to damages from the time when it either began marking its products in compliance with section 287(a) or when it actually notified [the infringer] of its infringement, whichever is earlier." American Medical Systems, Inc. v. Medical Engineering Corp., 6 F.3d 1523, 1537 (Fed.Cir.1993). "In determining whether the patentee marked its products sufficiently to comply with the constructive notice requirement, the focus is not on what the infringer actually knew, but on whether the patentee's actions were sufficient, in the circumstances, to provide notice in rem." Nike, Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 138 F.3d 1437, 1446 (Fed.Cir.1998).
The patentee bears the burden of proving compliance by a preponderance of the evidence. Nike, Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 138 F.3d 1437, 1446 (Fed.Cir.1998). Compliance with the marking statute is a question of fact. Gart v. Logitech, Inc., 254 F.3d 1334, 1339 (Fed.Cir.2001) cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1114, 122 S.Ct. 921, 151 L.Ed.2d 886 (2002). Consequently, the marking issue "is properly decided upon summary judgment when no reasonable jury could find that the patentee either has or has

1. Applicable Law
The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure give a trial court the discretion to conduct an in camera review of some or all of the disputed material sought to be discovered. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 193.4(a), 199.6. Generally, a trial court conducts an in camera inspection to determine if a document should be protected from discovery. See In re E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., 136 S.W.3d 218, 223 (Tex.2004) (orig. proceeding) (discussing claim of privilege). The trial court must conduct the in camera inspection of the disputed documents before deciding to compel the production of those documents. See id. However, when the basis for an objection resisting discovery is undue burden, it is not necessary for the trial court to conduct an in camera inspection and review of the particular discovery before ruling on the objection. See 3 McDonald & Carlson, § 12:61(g).

2. Application of the Law to the Facts
The trial court's order granting Ashkenazy & Agus's motion to compel states, in part:
It is further ORDERED that the results of said testing shall not be disclosed to anyone, (including the Parties, or the Parties' Counsel) other than the Court. The agents conducting the tests shall forward the results of the tests directly to the Court, and not to the Parties, their Counsel, or anyone else. Once the Court has received the test results, it intends to notify Counsel that it will conduct an in camera inspection of the test results, and notify Counsel the results thereof. Lead Counsel for [Ashkenazy & Agus] is hereby ORDERED to deliver a copy of this Order to any such agents who shall perform such tests, such that said agents will be aware of the contents of this Order. Any violation of any terms of this Order, by Counsel, the parties, or the agents taking the tests SHALL be punishable by contempt.
(emphasis in orig.).
Typically, in camera review allows a trial court to review information while maintaining nondisclosure and determine the merits of claims regarding whether the information should be protected from discovery. However, here, the order identifies no reason for in camera inspection. Although Ashkenazy & Agus appear to assume it will be able to use the results of the Phase II environmental testing as proof of its fraud by nondisclosure claim and for the purpose of inducing a settlement, the order does not allow use of the

Before DENNIS, CLEMENT, and OWEN, Circuit Judges.
PER CURIAM: *
       Shawn Lynn Davis moved the district court to reduce his sentence based
on Amendment 782 to the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, which altered the base
offense levels for certain drugs set forth in U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c). The district
court denied Davis’s motion and subsequent motion for reconsideration. Davis
appeals. We affirm.




       * Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not
be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH
CIR. R. 47.5.4.

      In 2009, Davis pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to
distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base (crack cocaine). A presentence
report (PSR) assessed a base offense level of 26 under the drug quantity table
in § 2D1.1(c). But because Davis was convicted of two prior drug offenses, the
PSR concluded he was a career offender. It increased his base offense level
under U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1(b)(A). After applying the career offender enhancement
and the acceptance of responsibility adjustment, Davis’s final offense level was
35, his criminal history was category VI

This action is submitted to the Court on defendant's motion for summary judgment and plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment. We agree that there is no genuine dispute of material fact, and, for the reasons set forth below, the Court will grant the defendant's motion.
Plaintiffs, three individual members of the American Federation of Grain Millers (AFL-CIO) International Union No. 33 [the Union], bring this action under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 [ERISA], 29 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq.; § 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C. § 185; and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201.
Defendant employed plaintiffs at its Consumer Packaging Division Plant in New Albany, Indiana, a facility defendant sold to Sonoco Products Company (Sonoco) on April 1, 1987. The parties have stipulated that on March 31, 1987, all employees at the plant "involuntarily separated employment from Boise Cascade and all employees' accrual of service in [the pension plan] terminated." On April 1, 1987, all employees at the plant became employees of Sonoco. Neither the Union nor Sonoco is party to this suit.
Beginning in the mid-1970's, defendant and the Union entered into a series of collective bargaining agreements, each of *378 which has incorporated a pension plan (the Plan) established pursuant to ERISA. The Plan provides, in part, that any employee of the defendant who has worked at least 20 years for the defendant and who has attained age 62 is entitled to early retirement benefits. As of March 31, 1987, each of the plaintiffs had at least 20 years of credited service, but none had attained age 62.
Plaintiffs contend that under the terms of the Boise agreements, they are entitled to receive from Boise full retirement benefits when they attain the age of 62, regardless of whether they are then unemployed or working for a different employer. They contend that the sale of the plant deprived them of the right to be employees of defendant when they reach age 62.
Defendant presents three arguments in support of its motion for summary judgment. First, defendant contends that suit is barred by plaintiffs' failure to invoke the grievance resolution mechanism set out in Article 8 of the collective bargaining agreement. Second, defendant argues that suit is barred by plaintiffs' failure to file any claim with the pension committee or pursue the appeal procedures set out in the Plan.

sentence on the grounds that it was illegal and void pursuant to the Ohio Supreme

Court’s decision in Ware. Following a resentencing hearing, on February 3, 2016, the

court sentenced Lausin to a mandatory prison term of six years on count one, and a

mandatory prison term of three years on count two, to be served concurrently. As

Lausin had already served in excess of seven years, he was released from prison.

        {¶18} We are called upon to determine whether Lausin’s original hybrid

sentence was void pursuant to Ware and whether Ware applies retroactively to Lausin’s

case.

        {¶19} On November 26, 2014, the Ohio Supreme Court decided Ware. In that

case, the appellant pleaded guilty to two counts of trafficking in crack cocaine in

violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(2).     Ware, 2014-Ohio-5201, at ¶2.         One count was a

second-degree felony and the other count was a fourth-degree felony. Id. Regarding

the appellant’s second-degree felony, the Court stated:




                                             5
       {¶20} “No sentencing statute allows a court to divide a singular ‘mandatory

prison term’ into a hybrid of mandatory and discretionary sub-terms.                      R.C.

2925.03(C)(4)(e) unambiguously requires a unitary ‘prison term’ that is ‘mandatory,’ and

R.C. 2929.13(F)(5) instructs that a court ‘shall not reduce’ that term through judicial

release. To override these legislative commands would require judicial improvisation in

a legal system in which ‘(c)rimes are statutory, as are the penalties therefor, and the

only sentence which a trial court may impose is that provided for by statute.’ Colegrove

v. Burns, 175 Ohio St. 437, 438 * * * (1964).” (Parallel citation omitted.) Id. at ¶17.

       {¶21} Like Ware, the case at bar also involves a second-degree felony. Again,

Lausin pleaded guilty to aggravated vehicular homicide, a felony of the second degree,

in violation of R.C. 2903.06(A)(1)(a). That

The second tier of interests is composed of the sponsors, which in turn consist of two classes: "tournament sponsors," who organize and conduct the tournament as co-sponsors with the PGA, typically to raise money for local charities; and "corporate sponsors," who support the Tour tournaments financially in exchange for publicity. The sponsors were associated in an organization called American Golf Sponsors, which included NEC, K-Mart and Anheuser-Busch, all of whom were corporate sponsors of tournaments.  Through a standard Sponsor Agreement, the PGA required the tournament sponsors to transfer all media rights, including television and radio broadcast rights, to the PGA and to give the PGA veto power over any radio broadcasting equipment that would be placed on the golf course.


5
The third tier of interests consists of Spectators' and its competitors in the on-site broadcasting business.  Eventually,  the PGA took over the on-site broadcasting niche itself, arranging to have the Tour events broadcast by Vanguard International,LLC, broadcasting as the "PGA Tour Radio Network."


6
Spectators' contends that the relevant market is the market for on-site advertising at golf tournaments.  According to Spectators', this market is not interchangeable with other kinds of sports advertising because of the unusually desirable demographic characteristics of the people who attend golf tournaments, in that the spectators are affluent, highly educated, and busy.


7
From 1986 to 1990, Spectators' dealt directly with the PGA, which reserved the right to "exercise extensive controls" and to charge Spectators' a fee for the privilege of broadcasting.  Their relationship ended in 1990, and Spectators' sued the PGA.  In the summer of 1991, the PGA gave Spectators' permission to enter broadcasting deals with the sponsors of individual tournaments.  That fall Spectators' and Anheuser-Busch entered a contract for Spectators' to broadcast sporting events as the "Budweiser Spectators Network," which involved advertising Anheuser-Busch products on-air and putting Anheuser-Busch logos on the Spectators' radios at one golf tournament, a car race, and a tennis match.  In November 1992, Anheuser-Busch confirmed by letter that it had agreed with Spectators' to sponsor the broadcast of seven unspecified events in 1993, with a formal contract to be drafted later.  In April 1993, Anheuser-Busch

The difficult and essentially meritorious problem upon this appeal is the fact that the county entered into this cooperation agreement by order and resolution of the county council and not by ordinance. In their petition the plaintiffs allege as a ground of invalidity that the cooperation agreement was entered into and approved by an order of the county council, that it was amended by an order or resolution rather than by an ordinance as required by section 22(18), Article III, of its charter and was therefore void. In their separate motions to dismiss the county and its supervisor admit, as is the incontestable fact, that the agreement and its amendment were entered into by an order and resolution. The contract was executed by order and resolution despite the fact that the Home Rule Charter of St. Louis County contains this explicit provision, Art. III, Sec. 22(18):
"Section 22. Pursuant to and in conformity with the Constitution of Missouri and without limiting the generality of the powers vested in the Council by this Charter, the Council shall have, by ordinance, the power:

* * * * * *
"(18) To cooperate or join by contract or otherwise with any city, county, state or political subdivision or agency thereof, or with the United States or any agency thereof, for the planning, development, construction, acquisition or operation of any public improvement or facility, or for a common service; and to accept, in the name of the County, gifts, devises, bequests, and grants-in-aid from any city, county, state or political subdivision or agency thereof, * * *."
The respondents meet this challenge and problem in this manner: The constitution, section 16, Article 6, provides that any political subdivision may contract and cooperate *498 with other political subdivisions "in the manner provided by law." Pursuant to this constitutional authorization the General Assembly has provided, in the statutes governing cooperation agreements between governmental units, that "Any municipality may exercise the power referred to in section 70.220 by ordinance duly enacted, or, if a county, then by order of the county court duly made and entered, or if other political subdivision, then by resolution of its governing body or officers made and entered in its journal or minutes of proceedings, which shall provide the terms agreed upon by the contracting parties to such contract or cooperative action." (Italics supplied.) V.A.M.S. § 70.230. In addition to the charter section (22(18)) empowering the county council to do certain things by

Approximately two weeks after the robbery, Mrs. Sara Marbury attended a lineup and identified appellant as one of the men who had robbed her. Appellant now argues that his identification by Mrs. Marbury should have been suppressed because, at the time of the lineup, he was being held under illegal arrest for another offense.
We have already determined this issue adversely to appellant's position in Ladd v. State, 426 So.2d 938 (Ala.Cr.App.1982). The legality of the arrest was upheld in a companion case, Johnson v. State, 406 So.2d 446 (Ala.Cr.App.1981). The identification testimony was properly admitted.

II
Appellant claims that his sentence was improper because one of the documents used to prove a prior conviction did not show that he was represented by counsel, or had waived counsel, at the time judgment was entered.
The Jefferson County docket sheet, introduced to prove appellant's prior conviction for burglary, shows, in the space labelled "Defense Attorney," the name "J. Louis Wilkinson." It also indicates that on September 24, 1976, appellant was "represented by his attorney of record herein" at arraignment. In addition, the record reveals that on January 11, 1977, the trial court denied a "motion [by] defense counsel Wilkinson."
Under the entry for May 18, 1977, however, there is no indication that appellant was accompanied by counsel. The notations for that date read as follows:
"Jury Verdict: We, the jury find the defendant guilty of burglary as charged in Count One of the indictment."
"In accordance with jury verdict defendant found guilty of burglary in second degree. Crowder, J."
"The defendant being called before the Court for sentence and asked whether he has something to say as to why sentence should not be pronounced against him says `No Sir.' It is the judgment and sentence of the Court that the defendant be imprisoned in the penitentiary for a term of 5 years, and it is hereby ordered that the defendant be credited with all of his actual time spent incarcerated in the Jefferson County Jail pending trial of this cause unless he was serving time for another offense. Crowder, Judge."
"Defendant files notice of appeal. Appeal bond set in amount of $10,000. Crowder, J."
The law is clear that an uncounselled prior conviction cannot be used to support guilt or to enhance punishment. Burgett v. Texas,

With the proof as hereinbefore stated before the District Court there was no sufficient basis for a finding of invalidity of the claims in suit by a reference to the Reed Patent. The burden of proving a want of novelty is upon the party who avers it. 35 U.S.C. § 282. The patent is prima facie valid. 35 U.S. C. § 282. Furthermore, it is well settled that where the alleged invalidity is based upon a patent which was before the Patent Office and was rejected as an anticipation of the invention, the presumption of novelty and invention is greatly strengthened. Southern States Equipment Corp. v. USCO Power Equipment Corp., 5 Cir., 209 F.2d 111, 118; General Electric Co. v. Save Sales Co., 6 Cir., 82 F.2d 100, 103. As far as this record discloses Reed Patent No. 2,200,966 was the only patent upon which the trial court relied in making the finding of invalidity.


11
One of the hazards of endeavoring to decide a patent infringement suit by a summary judgment procedure is that there would not ordinarily be anything before the Court by which a history of the progress of the patent in suit in the Patent Office could be ascertained. Apparently the Trial Court held that the Reed machine was the full mechanical equivalent of the Sullivan et al. disclosure. We think on the record which was before the District Court it was error to hold that the surface rollers in the Sullivan patent served the same purpose as the perforated plate of the Reed patent.


12
It seems apparent to us that there are present in this case genuine issues of material facts which could not be decided upon a motion for summary judgment. This is a case where there should have been a trial upon the merits. What we have said is based entirely on the record before us. We do not intend to indicate our view as to what the final decision in this case should be after a complete trial on the merits has been held in the District Court.

Reversed and remanded for a trial on the merits.

In this proceeding Brockton Taunton Gas Company (Brockton) petitions for review of an SEC order approving certain acquisitions of its common stock by Eastern Gas and Fuel Associates (Eastern).  Brockton is a Massachusetts gas company whose service territory adjoins that of Boston Gas Company, a wholly owned utility subsidiary of Eastern.  Eastern's objective is to gain control of Brockton so that Boston and Brockton can be operated as a coordinated and integrated utility system.  Because of its ownership of Boston, Eastern is an 'affiliate' within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act and under 9(a)(2) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 79i(a)(2), Commission approval is required before Eastern can acquire directly or indirectly 5% Or more of the voting securities of any other public utility company.

At the time of the filing of its application Eastern already held through another wholly owned subsidiary approximately 4.9% Of Brockton's common shares and also had

During the State's case in chief, a fingerprint specialist and an investigator with the State Patrol, in response to questions from both the State and the defense, stated that although the knife was examined for fingerprints, none were found. They also acknowledged that the State Patrol had experts who dealt with hair examinations, blood types, and tests for the presence of fibers or metal filings, but not one of these examinations was done.
As part of his defense, the defendant had subpoenaed two persons from the State Patrol criminal laboratory to testify. The State moved in limine to prohibit the witnesses from testifying as to what possible tests could have been run on the knife, as well as on the chair and defendant's clothing, on the ground that such evidence was not relevant. The motion was sustained.
The only showing in the nature of an offer of proof consisted of argument by trial counsel that there were certain tests which could have been performed which might have included or excluded the defendant as having the weapon in his possession. Counsel was unable to state just what tests could have been performed or what the tests could demonstrate. It was defendant's position that he would want to ask the subpoenaed witnesses questions to make that determination.
The sixth amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees to a defendant "compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor." (Emphasis supplied.) That clause is violated when a defendant is arbitrarily deprived of testimony that would have been relevant, material, and vital to the defense. United States v. Valenzuela-Bernal, 458 U.S. 858, 102 S.Ct. 3440, 73 L.Ed.2d 1193 (1982). "He must at least make some plausible showing of how their [the absent witnesses'] testimony would have been both material and favorable to his defense." Id. at 867, 102 S.Ct. at 3446.
If we understand defendant's argument correctly, he contends that the proffered witnesses could have testified that the clothing contained or did not contain filings from the knife or that the knife revealed or did not reveal body secretions from the defendant. It would seem to us that all that could be deduced from that testimony would be that if tests had been run, they would either have shown that the defendant had the knife on his person or that perhaps he did not.
Furthermore, there is no requirement that we know of that the State, during its investigation, must "leave no stone unturned." The prosecution may not deliberately withhold evidence which it knows or has

United States v. Smotherman, 285 F.3d 1115, 1116 (8th Cir. 2002). On remand, the
district court determined a corrected guidelines range of 210 to 262 months and
sentenced Smotherman to 250 months in prison. He again appeals, arguing that, in
sentencing him near the top of his corrected guidelines range, the court imposed a
presumptively vindictive sentence, thereby violating Smotherman’s due process rights
as defined in North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711 (1969), overruled in part by
Alabama v. Smith, 490 U.S. 794 (1989). We affirm.

        In Pearce, the Supreme Court held that the Due Process Clause bars a
sentencing judge from vindictively punishing the defendant for a successful appeal.
To guard against the danger of vindictiveness, the Court adopted the rule that,
“whenever a judge imposes a more severe sentence upon a defendant after a new trial,
the reasons for his doing so must affirmatively appear [and] be based upon objective
information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring
after the time of the original sentencing proceeding.” 395 U.S. at 726. Though
Pearce involved a resentencing after a second conviction, this principle also applies
to a resentencing after a sentence was vacated on appeal. United States v. Evans, 315

OPINION
HOWARD, Presiding Judge.
¶ 1 Appellant/defendant Jaydon Baugh challenges the trial court's finding that he was liable to appellee/plaintiff Royce Williams as a matter of law and granting summary judgment in favor of Williams on *374 the issue of liability in Williams's assault action. Baugh argues that A.R.S. § 13-807, which prohibits a defendant convicted in a criminal case from denying the essential allegations of the criminal conviction in a subsequent civil case, does not bar him from raising the affirmative defenses of justification, contributory negligence, and comparative fault. Because § 13-807 does not preclude a defendant from raising an affirmative defense that does not conflict with the essential allegations of the offense, we reverse.
¶ 2 When reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we view the evidence and reasonable inferences from it in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Link v. Pima County, 193 Ariz. 336, ¶ 12, 972 P.2d 669, 673 (App.1998). In March 2003, Baugh confronted Williams in a bar parking lot about his treatment of Celia Marquez that evening. After brandishing a knife and threatening Baugh, Williams was restrained and pulled back into the bar. Baugh, who was intoxicated, agreed to leave with Marquez. Marquez then drove to Williams's house, where Baugh entered and struck Williams with a gun.
¶ 3 Baugh was arrested, charged with, and subsequently pled guilty to aggravated assault and burglary. Williams then sued Baugh alleging, inter alia, that his action "constituted an intentional, aggravated, physical assault and battery." Williams filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability. In response Baugh argued the facts supported a justification defense and a claim of contributory negligence and comparative fault. The trial court granted Williams's motion, found Baugh liable, and precluded him from raising a justification defense. It entered a judgment that included a determination of finality pursuant to Rule 54(b), Ariz. R. Civ. P., 16 A.R.S., Pt. 2. Baugh now

Before SMITH, GARZA, and PRADO, Circuit Judges.

PER CURIAM:*

     Ronald W. Bunton, Texas inmate # 620942, appeals the

district court’s summary judgment for Defendant Kreuzer based on

qualified immunity in his pro se civil rights action, filed

pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.   Bunton alleged that Kreuzer’s

budget constraints resulted in a policy of hiring inadequate

medical staff at the Chambers County Jail where Bunton was

incarcerated as a pretrial detainee.   Kreuzer’s summary judgment


     *
       Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that
this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except
under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4.
                             No. 04-41031
                                  -2-

evidence showed that officials at the jail gave Bunton medication

that was prescribed for him and otherwise tended to his medical

needs.   Bunton has failed to show that Kreuzer was “deliberately

indifferent” in failing to hire adequate medical personnel or

that the purported inadequate hiring caused Bunton’s injury.       See

Conner v. Travis County, 209 F.3d 794, 796 (5th Cir. 2000).

After reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court

did not err in granting summary judgment for Kreuzer on this

claim.   See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324 (1986);

Little v. Liquid Air Corp., 37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir. 1994)(en

banc).   Judgment for Kreuzer on this claim is AFFIRMED.

        Per Curiam.  We have carefully reviewed the record in
this case, including the briefs of the parties.  Except as to
the disposition of the pendent claims, we find no abuse of
discretion in the dismissal of this case.  
          Several factors support the decision to dismiss this
case, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b).  First, plaintiff
violated an explicit court order by failing to file a response
to defendants' motion to dismiss.  See Figueroa Ruiz v.
Alegria, 896 F.2d 645, 647 (1st Cir. 1990).  Moreover, this
disobedience occurred after the district court had shown
sensitivity to plaintiff's pro se status by extending the time
for filing a response and explaining exactly why the previous
response was inadequate.  See Ferdik v. Bonzelet, 963 F.2d
1258, 1261 (9th Cir.) (upholding dismissal where court had
shown similar "sensitivity" to a pro se plaintiff's inadequate
complaint), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 915 (1992).  
          Second, dismissal occurred only after plaintiff had
been explicitly warned of the consequences of his failure to
obey the court order.  See Figueroa Ruiz, 896 F.2d at 547.
          Third, our review of the record convinces us that
plaintiff's case, at least in regard to its federal claims,
suffers from "glaring weaknesses."  Id.  For example, insofar
as any of plaintiff's constitutional claims are not time
barred, they are barred by the existence of adequate state
remedies for inverse condemnation and conversion.  See Culebras
Enterprises Corp. v. Rivera Rios, 813 F.2d 506, 512-13 (1st
Cir. 1987) (adequate state remedies

2010) (internal quotation mark omitted).                  At the summary judgment

stage, the plaintiff need not prove his case, but must proffer

sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to

whether he was fired because of his age.                      See Domínguez-Cruz

v. Suttle Caribe, Inc., 202 F.3d 424, 433 (1st Cir. 2000).


                                        -8-
           After noting that the parties agreed that Adamson had

made out the first, third, and fourth factors of his prima facie

case, the district court assumed that Adamson had made out the

second, and we follow suit.           See Gómez-González, 626 F.3d at 662

(finding it "expeditious and appropriate" to assume prima facie

case was made where primary focus of dispute was whether proffered

reasons for termination were pretextual).                We also agree with the

district   court    that      Walgreens    articulated     a     legitimate,   non-

discriminatory reason for terminating Adamson; namely, the two

incidents of what it perceived as inadequate customer service. The

parties do not appear to dispute either of these points on appeal.

           Instead, the parties focus on the final stage of the

burden-shifting analysis: whether Adamson presented sufficient

evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether

the proffered reason for his termination was pretextual and that

the "the pretextual reason[] [was] 'intended to cover up the

employer's real motive: age discrimination.'"                  Acevedo-Parrilla v.

Novartis Ex-Lax, Inc., 696 F.3d 128, 143 (1st Cir. 2012) (quoting

Mesnick v. Gen. Electric Co., 950 F.2d 816, 824 (1st Cir. 1991)).

"Pretext   can    be    shown    by   such    weaknesses,       implausibilities,

inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's

proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable

factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence and

hence   infer    that

moved for judgment as a matter of law.                          See Fed. R. Civ. P. 50.

The court granted Rullán’s motion, concluding that there was no

evidence that Rullán knew of Sepúlveda’s political affiliation

before firing him.         The court subsequently awarded Rullán $16,235

in    attorney’s    fees    on       the    ground       that    Sepúlveda’s    claim       was

frivolous. Sepúlveda appeals from the fee ruling.

            We review an appeal of an award of attorney’s fees for an

abuse of discretion.           See Foley v. City of Lowell, 948 F.2d 10, 18

(1st Cir. 1991).         Under 42 U.S.C. § 1988, a district court may

award a defendant attorney’s fees only “upon a finding that the

plaintiff's      action        was    frivolous,          unreasonable,        or     without

foundation, even though not brought in subjective bad faith.” Tang

v. State of R.I., Dept. of Elderly Affairs, 163 F.3d 7, 13 (1st

Cir. 1998) (quoting Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S.

412, 421 (1978)).          A claim on which a plaintiff cannot present a

prima    facie    case    at    the    time        she    files    a    complaint     may   be

frivolous.       See Andrade v. Jamestown Hous. Auth., 82 F.3d 1179,

1192 (1st Cir. 1996).          To establish a prima facie case of political

discrimination, a plaintiff must show that the official who took

the    adverse     action      was     aware       of    the     plaintiff's        political

affiliation.       See Gonzalez-Pina v. Rodriguez, 407 F.3d 425, 431

(1st Cir. 2005).

            Sepúlveda       makes          two    arguments       for    overturning        the

district court’s ruling.               First, he contends that the district

After twenty-seven years, the requirements of United States v. Garcia are at the hand of every trial judge in the circuit. It commands that the district court "address each defendant personally and forthrightly advise him of the potential dangers of representation by a counsel with a conflict of interest" and detail specifics about potential conflicts that are then foreseeable. The trial court should then seek to elicit a response from each defendant that he understands the details of the attorney's possible conflict of interest and the potential perils of such a conflict.

315 F.3d 510, 519-20 (5th Cir.2002).


16
During their initial counsel determination hearing, Salado and Aguirre-Garcia informed the magistrate judge that they both intended to hire the same attorney. In response, the magistrate judge advised them of the following:


17
This is not in your best interest to hire the same lawyer. Especially, in a case where there's a conspiracy charge or where it would be beneficial to one of you to blame the other. And if you are hiring the same lawyer because you're pooling your money, then I want you to know that you can have a court-appointed lawyer free of charge if you can't afford to hire your own independent lawyer.


18
The United States Constitution gives every criminal defendant the right to effective assistance of counsel. When one lawyer represents two or more defendants in a conspiracy case, the lawyer may be unable to represent all the defendants with the same fairness. This joint representation may cause a conflict of interest that denies a defendant the right to effective assistance of counsel. Conflicts are a potential problem because different defendants may have different degrees of involvement.


19
Each defendant has the right to a lawyer who represents him and him alone. There are potential dangers for each defendant when he is represented by counsel with a conflict of interest from representing two or more defendants in the same case. For example, the Government might offer to recommend a lesser sentence to one defendant if he cooperates with the Government. His lawyer should advise him whether or not to accept the offer. If a lawyer advised to accept, his cooperation may harm the case of the other defendant whom the lawyer also represents.


20
The Government might permit a defendant who is not as involved as other defendants to plead guilty to lesser charges than the other defendants. After the guilty plea, the Government may require a defendant to testify against the other defendant. The lawyer who represents more than one defendant might recommend that

 McComb, J., pro tem.
 This is an appeal by plaintiffs from a judgment in favor of defendants after a trial before a jury of an action brought to recover damages resulting from an automobile accident. *406
 Viewing the evidence most favorable to defendants (Ah Gett v. Carr, 3 Cal.App. 47, 48 [84 P. 458]), the facts in the instant case are:
 Plantiffs were riding in their automobile in an easterly direction on a rain covered and slippery boulevard, when defendants approached from the opposite direction on the same street at a speed of not more than twenty-five miles per hour. Defendants' car commenced to skid and passed out of control of the driver, colliding with the car in which plaintiffs were riding. Plaintiffs saw the defendants' car skidding when the cars were at least one hundred feet apart, but their car was not stopped nor the brakes applied until there was only a distance of about six feet between the two cars.
 Plaintiffs rely for reversal of the judgment on three propositions:
 First: The evidence is insufficient to support the verdict of the jury.
 Second: The trial court committed prejudicial error in (a) instructing the jury and (b) refusing to give certain instructions requested by plaintiffs.
 Third: The trial court committed prejudicial error in sustaining an objection to the question, "Now, Mr. Williams, bearing in mind the condition of the road on that particular day, bearing in mind that you are traveling at about 20 to 25 miles an hour, now, if you took your foot off the gas would you go into a skid?"
 [1] As to plaintiffs' first proposition, an examination of the record discloses there was sufficient evidence considered in connection with such inferences as the jury may have reasonably drawn therefrom to sustain each and every material finding of fact upon which the verdict in favor of defendants was necessarily predicated. We therefore refrain from further discussion of the evidence. (Leavens v. Pinkham & McKevitt, 164 Cal. 242, 245 [128 P. 399]; Koeberle v. Hotchkiss, 8 Cal.App.2d 634 [48 PaCal.2d 104].)
 [2] Turning to the second proposition, an examination of the record fails to reveal any prejudicial error committed by the trial court either in (a) instructing the jury or (b) refusing to give instructions requested by plaintiffs.

OPINION
HOWARD, Judge.
¶ 1 Appellant was tried in absentia and found guilty by a jury of one count of possession of drug paraphernalia with one prior conviction. He was sentenced to a presumptive prison term of 1.75 years. He raises three issues on appeal, none of which merits reversal.

TRIAL IN ABSENTIA
¶ 2 First, appellant argues that the trial court violated his due process rights by holding the trial in his absence. A criminal defendant has a right to be present at any proceeding, but may waive that right by "voluntarily absenting himself ... from it." Ariz. R.Crim. P. 9.1, 17 A.R.S. "`The finding of voluntary absence, and, therefore, the existence of a waiver of the right to be present, is basically a question of fact.' We will not upset a trial court's finding of voluntary absence... absent an abuse of discretion." State v. Bishop, 139 Ariz. 567, 569, 679 P.2d 1054, 1056 (1984), quoting Brewer v. Raines, 670 F.2d 117, 120 (9th Cir.1982). "The trial court may infer that a defendant's absence is voluntary if the defendant had personal knowledge of the time of the proceeding, his right to be present, and the warning that the proceeding would take place in his absence if he failed to appear." State v. Muniz-Caudillo, 185 Ariz. 261, 262, 914 P.2d 1353, 1354 (App.1996).
¶ 3 Although there is some dispute as to whether appellant believed the trial date was May 6 or May 9, he was advised at his arraignment that if he did not appear

This opinion supplements and clarifies our opinion of February 3, 1978, 156 N.J. Super. 72, concerning the issue of prejudgment interest in accordance with the parties' request.
The trial court judgment rejecting interest pursuant to N.J.S.A. 39:6A-5(b) and (c) is affirmed substantially for the reasons given by the trial judge in his oral opinion of March 25, 1977. In substance, the judge ruled that the defense asserted was a matter of novel impression and of some substance. We agree with this evaluation. Although N.J.S.A. 39:6A-5(b) and (c) speak in mandatory terms as to the allowance of interest at the rate of 10% per annum, discretion is imported into this enactment by the provision excusing payment of the statutory rate of interest where the insurer "has reasonable proof to establish that the insurer is not responsible for the payment * * *." Hence, where a court determines that a tendered defense to payment is of such substance that its validity should be judicially settled, payment of interest at the statutory rate, which is in excess of the legal rate of interest, is excused. We do not conceive Ortiz v. Safeco Ins. Co., 144 N.J. Super. 506 (App. Div. 1976), certif. den. 73 N.J. 63 (1977), as taking a contrary view. We agree with Ortiz that the subjective good faith of the carrier in interposing a defense to payment is immaterial. Rather, the determining factor is the objective merit of the defense, whatever way it is ultimately decided  not the good or bad faith of the carrier *179 in asserting it. Hence, a frivolous defense tendered in complete good faith as to its validity will not be held to excuse payment of the statutory interest.
We do not, however, read N.J.S.A. 39:6A-5(b) and (c) as impliedly forbidding assessment of prejudgment interest at the legal rate whenever it is determined that the statutory rate of interest will not be exacted. Prejudgment interest may run on liquidated claims, not as a matter of right, but rather in accordance with equitable principles and in the court's discretion. See Bak-A-Lum Corp. v. Alcoa Building Prod., 69 N.J. 123, 131 (1976). Any such interest awarded should, however, run from the date

Bailey v. United States
Myles claims in ground three above that he is "actually innocent" of "use"of a firearm as defined in Bailey, and that his sentence must be modified to remove the consecutive sixty-month term of imprisonment imposed pursuant to count three.
In Bailey, the Supreme Court recognized a defendant's right to be free of criminal liability under § 924(c)(1) for conduct that had previously supported a conviction, and recognized a new right within the meaning of § 2255(3). See United States v. Valdez, 195 F.3d 544, 547 (9th Cir.1999); United States v. Lloyd, 188 F.3d 184, 187 (3rd Cir.1999). In Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998), the Supreme Court made Bailey retroactively applicable to cases on collateral appeal.
In applying the Wofford, "savings clause" 3-step test to Myles' Bailey claim, (1) the Supreme Court's holding establishes that Myles was convicted of a nonexistent offense; (2) the Supreme Court has held the Bailey decision to be retroactive; but, (3) although the Bailey decision was not available to Myles at trial or on direct appeal, the Bailey decision was available to Myles in a § 2255 motion under AEPA during the year following the Bousley *1333 decision that made the Bailey decision retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. The one-year statute of limitations does apply to Bailey through application of § 2255(3). Lloyd 188 F.3d at 187-88; United States v. Black, 19 Fed.Appx. 78 (4th Cir.2001)(Petitioner's motion was untimely because the Supreme Court's decision in Bousley, which applied Bailey retroactively, preceded petitioner's § 2255 motion by over one year).
While courts have not thoroughly defined what is meant by "inadequate or ineffective," recent cases make clear that more is required than demonstrating that there is a procedural barrier to bringing a § 2255 motion.

To appreciate this ruling, the elements of conspiracy must be contrasted with those for harboring an illegal alien.   To prove conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 371, the government must show that (1) two parties entered into an agreement or reached an understanding to commit a crime, and (2) at least one of the parties overtly acted in furtherance of the agreement.   The elements of harboring an illegal alien under 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(C) are far more specific.   The government must prove that the defendant (1) harbored (2) an illegal alien (3) with reckless disregard for alien's unlawful presence in the United States.   That these crimes are different cannot be disputed.


14
At the time of the videotaped depositions, Wang, in the words of the district court,


15
thought that the heart of the Government's accusation was an agreement between [Wang] and [her ex-husband].  [She] was not in any way on notice that the Government would be relying on a theory of reckless disregard....  [Nor was she] on notice that [s]he had to worry about any actual harboring, because the Government wasn't required to prove any actual harboring when what [s]he thought [s]he was facing then was a conspiracy, [ ] the heart of which is an agreement.


16
As the district court recognized, "I think it's inescapable that we must conclude that in some fashion [Wang's] cross-examination of the witnesses would have been different if [she] had known what the specific charges were."   Indeed, during the videotaped depositions, Wang did not confront the witnesses regarding the harboring and reckless disregard elements.   Thus, the introduction of the depositions, which were taken when Wang was unaware of the ultimate charge for which she would be tried, squarely violated Wang's Sixth Amendment rights "to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation [and] to be confronted with the witness[es] against [her]."  U.S. Const. amend VI.2  See United States v. Feldman, 761 F.2d 380, 383-84, 389-90 (7th Cir.1985) (deposition testimony improperly admitted when at time of deposition no criminal charges were pending against the defendant).


17
Anticipating this conclusion, the government contends that a new trial should

It is Garcia's position that the showup conducted at the intersection of Sycamore and Charles violated his due process rights and that, therefore, Watkins' in-court identification should have been suppressed.
In determining the correctness of a trial court's ruling on a motion to suppress, the Supreme Court will uphold the trial court's findings of fact unless those findings are clearly erroneous. State v. Sardeson, 231 Neb. 586, 437 N.W.2d 473 (1989). In making this determination, this court does not reweigh the evidence or resolve conflicts in the evidence, but, rather, recognizes the trial court as the finder of fact and takes into consideration that the trial court has observed witnesses testifying in regard to such motions. Id.
A showup is usually defined as a one-on-one confrontation where the witness views only the suspect, and it is commonly conducted at the scene of the crime, shortly after the arrest or detention of a suspect and while the incident is still fresh in the witness' mind. State v. Richard, 228 Neb. 872, 424 N.W.2d 859 (1988). An identification procedure is constitutionally invalid only when it is so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to an irreparably mistaken identification that a defendant is denied due process of law. State v. Wickline, 232 Neb. 329, 440 N.W.2d 249 (1989). The initial inquiry is whether an identification procedure was suggestive. See, State v. Swoopes, 223 Neb. 914, 395 N.W.2d 500 (1986), overruled on other grounds, State v. Jackson, 225 Neb. 843, 408 N.W.2d 720 (1987); State v. Tramble, 187 Neb. 488, 191 N.W.2d 822 (1971); Salam v. Lockhart, 874 F.2d 525 (8th Cir.1989), cert. denied ___ U.S. ___, 110 S.Ct. 252, 107 L.Ed.2d 202; State v. Collette, 199 Conn. 308, 507 A.2d 99 (1986); State v. Vaughn, 101 Wash.2d 604, 682 P.2d 878 (1984); 1 W. LaFave & J. Israel, Criminal Procedure § 7.4 (West 1984). A determination of impermissible suggestiveness is based on the totality of the circumstances. Swoopes, supra. If an identification procedure

17
4. At the conclusion of all the evidence, the district court must determine as a factual matter whether the prosecution has shown by a preponderance of the evidence independent of the statement itself (1) that a conspiracy existed; (2) that the co-conspirator and the defendant against whom the co-conspirator's statement is offered were members of the conspiracy; and (3) that the statement was made during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.


18
The government seeks to modify these decisions; it requests a less formal procedure, one which allows the hearsay to be received on a conditional basis subject to "connecting it up."  This is not new.  It has been practiced by prosecutors for, lo, these many years.  During all of this time courts have condemned it.  By the time the connected up stage arrives, the evidence has blended so that there is no distinction between hearsay and non-hearsay.


19
United States v. James, supra, ruled that henceforth there was to be a preferred order of proof.  Our decisions in Andrews and Petersen are basically in accord with James.


20
The government seeks adoption of an exception to the James doctrine.  It requests a ruling that it is not practical to require the conspiracy to be established in advance of the offer of the statements.  It would have us rule that it is permissible to receive the statements of the co-conspirators subject to their being connected.  The trial court, based on the decisions in James, Andrews and Petersen, rejected this.  The trial court recognized that this court has adopted a higher standard based on the Federal Rules of Evidence.  These rules allow a trial judge to ground his or her decision on hearsay, but it does not allow the use of the bootstrapping which was practiced prior to the adoption of the Rules.


21
We have reviewed the government's proposal and the trial court's ruling in an effort to discover merit in the government's position.  We have been unable to discover any such merit and have concluded that the trial court's rulings are correct.

The Jurisdiction Issue

22
Based upon the representations of the United States Attorney as to the extreme emergency and high importance of the matter being presented, we issued an order staying the commencement of the trial pending a review of the proceedings.  The trial court had concluded that "because the government's notice of appeal is manifestly deficient and clearly invalid, this court has jurisdiction to

The first question is whether the document was relevant. Relevant evidence means evidence having the tendency to make the existence of a fact that is of consequence to the action more probable or less probable. TEX. R.CRIM. EVID. 401. The document contains a notation made by the booking officer stating that Stafford "suffers from paranoid delusions and states he works for the CIA and they will kill him," that he was "talking to himself stating he works for CIA. Rambling conversation. Says he had 1 beer. Appears to be under influence." In reviewing a trial court's determination about whether a particular piece of evidence was relevant, we look to see whether the trial court abused its discretion in determining its admissibility. Stone v. State, 574 S.W.2d 85, 89 (Tex.Crim. App. [Panel Op.] 1978). Thus, we will uphold the trial court's ruling on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. That is to say, as long as the trial court's ruling was within the zone of reasonable disagreement, we will not intercede. Montgomery v. State, 810 S.W.2d 372, 391 (Tex.Crim.App.1990).
In this case, the portion of the document that the officer filled out personally stated that Stafford claimed that the CIA was out to get him. Although this may reflect a certain level of paranoia, it does not have any likelihood to prove whether or not Stafford threatened to kill Officer Paradis. Thus, the court's determination that it was not relevant is within the zone of reasonable disagreement. This point of error is overruled.
The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.
GRANT, Justice, dissenting.
To hold that a hearing and ruling by another judge on a motion to recuse is subject to the harmless error rule on appeal renders the rule and the statute meaningless. If there is harmful error in the case, then the case will be reversed anyway, whether an assigned judge heard the motion to recuse or not. Therefore, why should the trial judge who is asked to recuse ever ask a presiding judge to assign a visiting judge to hear the motion for recusal?
I dissent because I believe that the rule requiring the assignment of another judge to hear a recusal motion is mandatory. The legislative history of this statute reflects that the Legislature did not intend for this provision to be optional with the judge. The Interim Report of the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives, 65th Legislature,

"A lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation."
[3]  Pursuant to Maryland Rule 1.3, "[a] lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client."
[4]  Maryland Rule 1.4 requires a lawyer to "keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information."
[5]  Maryland Rule 1.15 provides, as relevant:

"(a) A lawyer shall hold property of clients or third persons that is in a lawyer's possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyer's own property. Funds shall be kept in a separate account maintained pursuant to Title 16, Chapter 600 of the Maryland Rules. Other property shall be identified as such and appropriately safeguarded. Complete records of such account funds and of other property shall be kept by the lawyer and shall be preserved for a period of five years after termination of the representation."
[6]  As pertinent, Rule 1.16 provides:

"(d) Upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client's interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of fee that has not been earned. The lawyer may retain papers relating to the client to the extent permitted by other law."
[7]  Maryland Rule 8.1(b) provides:

"An applicant for admission to or reinstatement to the bar, or a lawyer in connection with a bar admission application or in connection with a disciplinary matter, shall not:
* * * *
"(b) fail to disclose a fact necessary to correct a misapprehension known by the person to have arisen in the matter, or knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from an admissions or disciplinary authority, except that this Rule does not require disclosure of information otherwise protected by Rule 1.6 [pertaining to the confidentiality of information]"
[8]  Rule 8.4, in relevant part, provides:

"It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:
* * * *
"(c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation;
"(d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice."

745 F.3d 834, 837 (7th Cir. 2014).

       In White, the Seventh Circuit distinguished White’s § 3582(c) sentence reduction

from Magwood’s resentencing. 745 F.3d at 836. White requested and received a

sentence reduction after the Sentencing Commission adopted a retroactive amendment

cutting the offense levels for crack-cocaine offenses (as did Quary), while Magwood was

sentenced anew after demonstrating in his initial collateral attack that his original

sentence violated the Constitution. Id. at 835-36. The White court observed that at a

resentencing, a district judge may receive evidence and reopen issues decided in the

original sentencing before holding a hearing and pronouncing a new sentence. Id. at 836.

By contrast, a court granting a sentence reduction “takes as established the findings and

calculations that led to the sentence and changes only the revised Guideline, leaving

                                              4
everything else the same.” Id. In other words, “[t]he penalty goes down, but the original

judgment is not declared invalid.” Id. Therefore, the Seventh Circuit concluded,

“Magwood does not reset the clock or the count, for purposes of § 2244 and § 2255,

when a prisoner’s sentence is reduced as the result of a retroactive change to the

Sentencing Guidelines.” Id. at 837.

       In Jones, the Fifth Circuit noted that Magwood does not define the term “new

judgment” but held that Jones “received a reduced sentence [under § 3582(c)(2)], not a

new one.” 796 F.3d at 485. The court determined that the sentence-reduction procedure

“does not in any way resemble a full resentencing” because it “leaves undisturbed the

findings and calculations that formed the recommended sentencing range, changing only

the revised Guideline.” Id. at 486.

       And in Sherrod, the Ninth Circuit reasoned that a sentence reduction under

§ 3582(c)(2) is not akin to a resentencing, stating that “[t]he Supreme Court has

cautioned that the exception to sentencing finality in § 3582(c)(2) is narrow in scope and

is intended to authorize only a limited adjustment to an otherwise

    Oceana contends that it was arbitrary and capricious for
the Fisheries Service to exclude the use of electronic
monitoring (video cameras) from its Reporting Methodology.
Under the proper standard of review, this Court is “highly
deferential” to the agency’s decision and presumes that the
agency action is valid. See Ethyl Corp. v. EPA, 541 F.2d 1, 34
(D.C. Cir. 1976) (en banc) (citing Citizens to Preserve Overton
Park v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 415 (1971)). Nonetheless, we are
not a “rubber stamp,” and we must ensure that the agency
considered all of the relevant factors. Id.

     In implementing a Reporting Methodology consistent with
the statutory demands of the FSA, the Fisheries Service
decided to make use of at-sea observers rather than electronic
monitoring. In response to comments received during the
notice-and-comment period, the Fisheries Service explained
why it made this decision. The Fisheries Service described
issues with the affordability of electronic monitoring. 80 Fed.
Reg. 37,182, 37,191. The agency also noted that, in some
scenarios, “electronic monitoring is not yet considered robust
enough to replace observers for bycatch monitoring.” 3 Id. The
3
    The Fisheries Service explains:

       a technology [electronic monitoring] that is suitable for
       identification of bycatch of a distinctive species by a specific
       gear type, such as bluefin tuna in the pelagic longline fishery,
                               12
Reporting Methodology elaborated on these shortcomings.
Unlike at-sea observers, “electronic monitoring is currently
capable of acquiring only simple presence and absence data
rather than [] highly detailed data.” J.A. 613-14.

     The Fisheries Service’s explanation for why it chose not
to include electronic monitoring in its Reporting Methodology
is sufficient to pass “arbitrary and capricious” review. Oceana
insists that these explanations are improperly grounded in pre-
2008 information. While the Fisheries Service could not ignore
important evidence that was developed between 2008 and
2015, it is not prohibited from relying on information it used in
2008 when it promulgated an earlier version of this rule.
Instead, Oceana must prove that the Fisheries Service “

                               DECISION ON JOINT STIPULATION1

Gowen, Special Master:

        Georgia Murdock [“petitioner”] filed a petition for compensation under the
National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program2 on April 19, 2013. Petitioner alleges
that she suffered Guillain-Barre syndrome [“GBS”] that was caused in fact by the Tdap
and/or flu vaccine she received on February 25, 2012. See Stipulation, filed June 27,
2014, at ¶¶ 2, 4. Further, petitioner alleges that she experienced residual effects of her
injury for more than six months. Id. at ¶ 4. Respondent denies that the Tdap and/or flu
vaccine caused petitioner’s alleged GBS, or any other injury, and further denies that
petitioner’s current disabilities are sequelae of a vaccine-related injury. Id. at ¶ 6.

  Because this unpublished decision contains a reasoned explanation for the action in this case, I intend
to post this decision on the United States Court of Federal Claims' website, in accordance with the E-
Government Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-347, § 205, 116 Stat. 2899, 2913 (codified as amended at 44
U.S.C. § 3501 note (2006)). In accordance with Vaccine Rule 18(b), a party has 14 days to identify and
move to delete medical or other information, that satisfies the criteria in 42 U.S.C

The facts. The debtor is a holding company whose petition, filed under section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended, 11 U.S.C.A. § 207, was decreed by the court to have been properly filed and in good faith compliance with said Bankruptcy Act and all creditors were enjoined from prosecuting suits in equity or actions at law against said debtor.
The debtor was continued in possession of its property.
Its balance sheet as of December 31, 1936, showed assets valued at $89,384,996.57 and liabilities of $54,000,000 including $36,000,000 in principal of its thirty-year 5 per cent. Gold Debentures, due February 1, 1959, and $14,000,000 twenty-year 5½ per cent. Gold Debentures due June 1, 1947. *600 The debtor sought instructions from the court in reference to the payment of the semi-annual interest instalment upon the aforementioned debenture issues. Certain minority creditors objected to the payment of interest. The court made findings and entered an order directing the debtor not to pay the interest due thereon February 1, 1937, and June 1, 1937. It appeared that the debentures were in no way secured; that the debtor had available cash, and cash resources, of $23,000,000 with which to pay interest or to retire debentures, which cash was drawing no interest.
Thereafter the petition which resulted in the decree from which these appeals were presented, was filed. It was filed by the debtor, was duly verified by the assistant treasurer, but no proof was offered in support of the allegations therein contained. The petition set forth the existence of the outstanding debentures of $50,000,000 and referred to Article 5, Section 2, of the trust indentures which empowered the trustee in its discretion, and if requested in writing by the holders of a majority in principal amount of the respective issues of debentures then outstanding, to declare the principal of all of said debentures and the interest unpaid thereon to be immediately due and payable in case of default in payment of interest or other specified defaults. It further stated that the court had directed the debtor not to pay the interest due and soon to be due. The petition further stated that if the trustee exercised its power to accelerate the maturity dates of the debentures the possibilities of the debtor's effecting a satisfactory and acceptable plan of reorganization would be materially lessened and the equities

Raymond J. DeRaymond, with him Theodore R. Lewis and Coffin, DeRaymond and Shipman, for appellees.
*616 OPINION BY JUDGE CRUMLISH, JR., May 11, 1973:
This is an appeal from an order of the Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board dismissing appellants' petition to terminate a compensation agreement.
In June of 1967 claimant, Robert Transue, fell in the course of his employment at Falk's Food Basket and suffered severe injuries to both legs. At that time and for the period continuing to the present, claimant was the owner, along with his wife, of an operating restaurant and bar. In July of 1967 a compensation agreement was entered into and approved by the Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board under which claimant was to receive compensation for total disability. On October 30, 1968 the employer and its carrier filed a petition for modification and, after hearing, the referee directed that compensation be paid on the basis of 40% partial disability.[1]
On April 5, 1971 employer filed a petition to terminate the compensation agreement on the grounds that disability had ceased and claimant had suffered no loss of earning power since March 8, 1971. After a hearing, the referee granted the petition to terminate and suspended compensation. The referee found that the claimant was still 30% disabled but was able to work approximately eight hours per day in a job not requiring constant ambulation and there was no loss of earnings because he was engaged as an active partner of a going business.
The Board, having reviewed the record and the findings of the referee, vacated the referee's decision and dismissed the petition to terminate. The Board concluded that the referee's finding as to claimant's ability to work was meaningless since there was no evidence *617 as to claimant's work experience, his education, and whether such jobs are available. The Board further concluded that claimant's ownership of the bar and the restaurant was also meaningless since the only proof in the case showed that the bar was not making money.

appeal, Rodriguez’s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to Anders

v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), stating that there are no

meritorious       issues       for    appeal     but    questioning          whether      the

district court complied with the requirements of Fed. R. Crim.

P.   11   in    accepting      Rodriguez’s       guilty     plea      and    whether      the

district court imposed an unreasonable sentence.                            Rodriguez was

notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but

has not done so.          The Government has declined to file a response

brief.    For the reasons that follow, we affirm.

      Before accepting a guilty plea, the district court must

conduct a plea colloquy in which it informs the defendant of,

and determines that the defendant comprehends, the nature of the

charge    to    which     he   is    pleading     guilty,      the    maximum     possible

penalty he faces, any mandatory minimum penalty, and the rights

he   is   relinquishing         by   pleading        guilty.       Fed.     R.    Crim.   P.

11(b)(1); United States v. DeFusco, 949 F.2d 114, 116 (4th Cir.

1991).     The court also must ensure that the plea is supported by

an   independent         factual     basis     and    not   the      result      of   force,

P. 11(b)(2), (3).

       Because Rodriguez did not move to withdraw his guilty plea

or otherwise preserve error in the plea proceedings, we review

his plea colloquy for plain error.                    United States v. Massenburg,

564 F.3d 337, 342 (4th Cir. 2009).                      To establish plain error,

Rodriguez must demonstrate that the district court erred, the

error was plain, and the error affected his substantial rights.

MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
KRAM, District Judge.
The defendant, Jose Ramos, has moved pursuant to Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to suppress as evidence post-arrest statements made by him to Assistant United States Attorney Robert L. Folks prior to his presentment before a United States Magistrate. For the reasons stated below, the motion to suppress is DENIED.

BACKGROUND
Mr. Ramos was arrested at approximately 4:00 p.m. on December 13, 1984, in the vicinity of West 111th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue, for allegedly steering an undercover agent to a seller to purchase cocaine. He was taken to the 26th Police precinct, at 530 West 126th Street, for processing. There, he was fingerprinted, photographed, and interviewed by the arresting officers regarding his name, age, address, etc.
At 8:50, some five hours after his arrest, he was interviewed at the 26th Precinct by Assistant United States Attorney Folks for a period of twenty minutes. At this interview, Mr. Ramos was advised by AUSA Folks that he had a right to remain silent and a right not to answer any questions. He was further advised that he had a right to counsel; that, if he could not afford one, an attorney would be appointed for him; and that an attorney could be appointed before the interview and could be present during the interview if desired. After each statement of rights, Mr. Ramos was asked if he understood the statement. Mr. Ramos responded, in most cases with a nod, *1059 that he understood all the rights described.[1] Mr. Ramos was then asked questions about his background. Thereafter, Mr. Ramos was asked questions, and made certain statements, relating to the conduct for which he was arrested. Following the interview, Mr. Ramos was

MEMORANDUM
RAYMOND J. BRODERICK, District Judge.
On November 20, 1978, plaintiff Martin Holler ("Holler"), administrator of the estate of Darrol L. Holler, filed with this Court a complaint alleging that Darrol Holler's death resulted from an accident that occurred while he was a passenger on an "umbrella" ride manufactured by Hampton Amusement Corporation ("Hampton Amusement") and was the proximate result of the defective condition of said ride and the negligence of the manufacturer. Discovery proceeded in the matter until mid-1980. Shortly before this time, Holler discovered that Hampton Amusement, incorporated under the laws of Missouri, was no *7 longer an active corporation and that its assets had been sold to E-J Manufacturing Co., Inc. ("E-J"), a Missouri corporation that now manufactures amusement rides under the fictitious name of Hampton Rides. Believing E-J to be a successor corporation of Hampton Amusement and therefore subject to suit, Holler commenced this action against E-J on May 19, 1980, filing a complaint that substantially restated the averments of the complaint filed against Hampton Amusement.
On December 10, 1980, E-J filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, averring that E-J did not possess sufficient minimum contacts with Pennsylvania to be sued by Holler, a Pennsylvania resident, in this diversity action. For the reasons hereinafter set forth, the Court will deny E-J's motion to dismiss.
The records of the Missouri Secretary of State show that Hampton Amusement was incorporated in Missouri on May 19, 1966, that it failed to pay its corporate franchise tax, failed to file an annual report during 1978, and that on January 1, 1979, Hampton Amusement lost its corporate standing in the state of Missouri. The Secretary of State's records also show that on February 24, 1978, Hampton Rides was registered as a fictitious name in Missouri, and that E-J is the owner of Hampton R

It is noted, however, that the court added at page 55: "We do not doubt that, ordinarily, where a seller is guilty of unlawful discrimination in prices between customers, the amount of the price difference is the measure of damages, but we think that is not so here." (Plaintiff failed to prove that it was damaged in its business and property in any definite amount by the defendant's practice.)
[6]  In this case, the court said at page 460:

"At all events the statute should not be read as creating any presumption that `where the fact of damage is shown * * * the pecuniary amount or equivalent of the prohibited discrimination' is the proper `measure of damages.'"
Plaintiffs' argument concerning this case at page 2 of their letter of April 10, attached to Document No. 73, is rejected.

Whether the Trial Court Erred By Admitting the EEOC Determination Letter
		The state argues that the trial court erred by admitting the EEOC determination letter
into evidence.  As mentioned above, the State filed a motion in limine to exclude the letter in which
it argued that the letter was "hearsay, irrelevant and any probative value is substantially outweighed
by the danger of unfair prejudice or misleading the jury."  The court granted the motion but permitted
Wolfe to revisit the issue outside the jury's presence during trial.  Wolfe did so, and the following
discussion occurred:

THE COURT:  Then with respect to the EEOC determination letter, which is
Plaintiff's Exhibit 74, is it offered?

PLAINTIFF:  It is offered, Your Honor.

THE COURT: What is your objection, [State]?

THE STATE: Your honor, we have objected to that on 402--Rule 402, relevance;
403, prejudice; 802, hearsay; and [602], lack of personal knowledge.

THE COURT: I'm sorry.  Lack of personal knowledge?

THE STATE: Correct.  The person who prepared the report is not the person--or
who investigated it.  The person who signed it did not actually conduct the
investigation.

THE COURT: And--all right.  Anything else you want to say about it?

THE STATE: Yes, Your Honor.  It's highly prejudicial because, as we explained
earlier, if this report comes in, then we'll have to offer evidence that the TWC, the
Texas Workforce Commission, found it [sic] contrary and had to forward the file to
the EEOC.  I think we just get way off track of what the issues in this trial are.  And
I think we're suggesting to the jury that somehow this incomplete and conflicting
investigation is relevant to the decisions that they have to make at this trial.  Our
position is it is clearly prejudicial under Rule 403 and should not be admitted.

THE COURT: The objections to 402 and [802] are overruled.  I'm going to roll the
602 and 403 objections into one because under the case authority the Court is to
consider the prejudicial effect combined with the circumstances of the report and
what the report says . . . .

United States Court of Appeals Ninth Circuit.

Joseph L. Bortin, San Franciso, Cal., for appellant.
Chauncey Tramutolo, U.S. Atty., and Joseph Karesh, Asst. U.S. Atty., San Franciso, Cal., for appellee.
Before MATHEWS, BONE and POPE, Circuit Judges.
PER CURIAM.


1
This appeal is from an order denying a petition of appellants, Don Willis, Michael Stignano, Henry Mayes, Charles T. Livers, Joseph Gordon Isenberg, Lyle Howard Buswell and Paul Dean Barker, for a writ of habeas corpus directed to appellee, E. B. Swope, warden of the United States Penitentiary at Alcatraz, California.  The petition was as follows:'(Appellants), by this, their petition for writ of habeas corpus, now aver:

'1. (Appellants) are confined and restrained of their liberty by (appellee).

'2. This application is made on behalf of (appellants) by Joseph L. Bortin, an attorney and counselor at law, duly licensed to practice his profession in all courts of the State of California and in the United States District Courts for the Northern and Southern Divisions of the State of California1 and in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, for the reasons hereinafter set forth.

'3. Heretofore, to wit, between June 9, and June 17, 1952, (appellants) requested (Bortin) by letter to visit them at Alcatraz, California.  Thereafter, to wit, on June 17, 1952, (Borton) made application for permission to visit (appellants) at Alcatraz, California.  Thereupon (appellee), at first, temporized with (Bortin), stating that 'It would not be convenient for (Bortin) to come to Alcatraz 'this week." Thereafter, to wit, on June 20, 1952, (Bortin) requested permission to visit (appellants) on June 24, 1952.  After further temporizing, (appellee), by and through his servant, agent and employee, one John Doe Bertrand, stated and

 (b) To defendants, any remaining money up to a total of $51,510.35.
 (c) If any amount remains, one-third to plaintiff and two-thirds to defendants.
 [7] It will be observed that the judgment requires that the deficiency in Thies' drawings be paid out of defendants' share of the partnership, and not out of the partnership as a whole. This is an error. Thies was entitled to receive from the partnership an amount equal to one- half of what the two defendants took. Paying it to Thies' executrix out of the assets of the partnership, as it should be paid, will reduce the net worth of the partnership, including plaintiff's portion.
 [8] Although plaintiff is entitled to interest on the *827 amounts which were wrongfully withheld, there appears to be no reason for computing it to November 27, 1959, and then charging interest on interest from that date. Simple interest from the date each portion was payable to the date of judgment is the proper measure of damages for the detention of money. (Civ. Code,  3287; Stats. 1919, p. lxxxiii. See Fuller v. White, 33 Cal.2d 236, 240 [201 P.2d 16].)
 The provision of the judgment that plaintiff receive the appraised value of the partnership cannot be supported under the circumstances of this case. When dissolution is caused in any way except in contravention of the partnership agreement, each partner may have the partnership property applied to discharge its liabilities and the surplus applied to pay in cash the net amount owing to the respective partners. (Corp. Code,  15038, subd. (1).) This is the relief demanded by plaintiff in the complaint, the amended complaint and in the notice of dissolution. When a partnership is liquidated the assets are sold and the proceeds divided, or the assets may be distributed in kind, but it is ordinarily improper to require one partner to pay the other the appraised value of an asset. (Harper v. Lamping, 33 Cal. 641, 649; Rice v. Watkins, 85 Cal.App.2d 44, 51 [191 P.2d 810].)
 Corporations Code, section 15042, provides that if the business is continued under specified conditions the retiring partner may have the value of his interest as of the date of dissolution ascertained, and shall receive as an ordinary creditor an amount equal to this value with interest or a proportion of the

        Correctional Officer Allen Moorehead testified that he assisted other officers in moving the
defendant from the D cell block to a holding cell on July 9, 2002. After Correctional Officers Larry
Spivey and Jeff Henson had received “some information,” Spivey conducted a pat-down search of
the defendant and discovered a weapon in the defendant’s sock.

        Correctional Officer Larry Spivey testified that, after receiving information that the defendant
possibly had a weapon, he and Henson went to the holding cell where the defendant had been placed
to search for the weapon. While patting down the defendant’s right leg, Spivey discovered
“something in his sock” around the ankle area. The defendant then handed him “a metal shank-type
object,” which Spivey described as “an item approximately six inches long, and had the handle
wrapped with a cloth to use the handle. It was pointed.” In Spivey’s opinion, the point of the
weapon was sharp and there was another sharp edge where a piece of metal had been bent upward.

        The fifty-two-year-old defendant testified that he was an inmate in the Marshall County Jail
on July 9, 2002, serving a six-month sentence for passing a worthless check. Prior to that day,
Chumbley had conducted an inspection and instructed him to clean the toilet paper out of the air
conditioning vent in his cell. When he told Chumbley that he did not put the toilet paper in the vent
and did not have anything with which to clean it, Chumbley replied, “Find something to clean it out
with.” After trying to use an ink pen which broke, the defendant asked Trusty Ray Usury to bring
him a screwdriver, but Usury brought a folded “piece of tin” instead. The defendant then “took a
sock or rag, wrapped it around it, and commenced to clean the vent out.” The defendant said he only
put the rag around the tin to avoid cutting his hand while cleaning the vent. He spent a total of six
hours cleaning the vent because it was very difficult to remove the toilet paper.

and that he had hidden it inside his clothing. Officers subsequently conducted a “random
shakedown,” and inmates were brought out into the

The Pursuit
There is no doubt in the Court's mind that a genuine issue of fact exists concerning the wisdom of chasing a motorcyclist through an urban and residential area at 70 to 80 miles per hour. The question raised by the defendants' motions, however, is whether a genuine issue of material fact exists concerning the constitutionality of the pursuit.[2] The primary difficulty facing the plaintiff is finding a source for such a right within the Constitution. His complaint rests on the Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. To consider the pursuit as a Fourth Amendment violation, the Court must find that it constituted an unreasonable search or seizure. To consider it as an Eighth Amendment violation, the Court must find that it is a form of cruel and unusual punishment. To consider it as a Fourteenth Amendment violation, the Court must find that it deprived plaintiff of liberty or property without due process.
In Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1, 105 S.Ct. 1694, 85 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985), the Supreme Court held that an unreasonable "seizure" occurred when a police officer shot an unarmed fleeing suspect when it was unnecessary to prevent his escape and the officer lacked probable cause to believe that the suspect posed a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to others. 471 U.S. at 3, 105 S.Ct. at 1697. If Officer Pottebaum had shot the plaintiff, Garner would permit the Court to find that a seizure had occurred. But can a chase which results in a collision constitute a seizure? The plaintiff contends that he can show that the chase created a risk of death or serious injury to the plaintiff which was as high as the risk created by a pistol shot. Quoting Garner, he contends that the use of such potentially deadly tactics is unconstitutional because it "frustrates the interests of the individual, and of society, in judicial determination of guilt and punishment." 471 U.S. at 9, 105 S.Ct. at 1700. However, in Garner, the Supreme Court found that the suspect was seized because the officer restrained the freedom of the suspect to walk away by shooting him. The other considerations referred to by the plaintiff were related to the separate question of whether that seizure was unreasonable. In Galas v. McKee, 801 F.2d 200, 203 (6th Cir.1986), the Sixth Circuit addressed a nearly identical case, and found that no seizure had occurred:
In summary,

The sole question here presented is whether Olive and Rosella Conrad were, "as a matter of fact", "wholly dependent" upon their deceased sister, Evelyn Conrad, at the time of her death July 10, 1954, so as to enable them to bring suit under Art. 67, Sec. 4 of the Code of Maryland (1951). The appellant, of course, contends the facts do not show them to have been "wholly dependent" under the statute, and the appellees maintain the facts do.
Prior to 1852, under the common law, Maryland permitted no recovery for pecuniary loss suffered by a relative of one killed by the negligence of another. In that year, the Legislature enacted Ch. 299 of the Acts of 1852, which provided an action at law for the benefit of a wife, husband, parent and child of a person whose death shall have been caused by the wrongful act, neglect or default of another, against the person wrongfully causing said death. The list of persons entitled to recover under the then Sec. 2 of the above Act, remained the same until 1937, when it was enlarged to permit recovery by the mother of an illegitimate child and by an illegitimate child when the deceased person was the mother of such child. In 1952, the Legislature again added to this list by including relatives of the deceased who met certain dependency qualifications, but only if there were no surviving wife, husband, parent or child. The pertinent part of the present law, (Art. 67, Sec. 4), reads:
"Every such action shall be for the benefit of the wife, husband, parent and child of the person whose death shall have been so caused or if there be no such person or persons entitled, then any person related to the deceased by blood or marriage, who, as a matter of fact, was wholly dependent upon the person whose death shall have been so caused." (Italics supplied.)
It will be noted in the above, if the action be brought by *443 the surviving wife, husband, parent or child, he or she must establish the amount that the deceased had, and probably would continue to have, contributed to his or her support, but need not prove dependency. More distant relatives, to the contrary, must prove they were "wholly dependent" in order to have any standing in court. This seems to be the effect of the words "as a matter of fact". In some of the Workmen's Compensation statutes, close relatives are extended a presumption concerning dependency

D. What Did The Fellowship Prove It Owned?

The SAP Fellowship chose not to maintain any bank accounts or even maintain records of its finances. That decision may well be consistent with the group's philosophy.[21] The absence of bank accounts or records may also, whether as a deliberately sought "benefit" or not, make it more difficult for law enforcement to investigate its activities. Whatever the reasons for an absence of records  be they philosophical or otherwise  the decision has a price which goes beyond the inability to earn interest on bank deposited funds. That price certainly includes the inconvenience that results when the Fellowship finds itself involved in a legal proceeding in which it has the burden of proof.
In this case, had the SAP Fellowship had its own bank account in which it maintained its funds it might have little problem in prevailing as to those funds.[22] Similarly, although perhaps less conclusively, had the SAP Fellowship maintained records of its funds and had Kotmair as Fiduciary keep the association funds completely separate from his own, the Fellowship would have at least a possibility of carrying its burden of proof. However, the Fellowship presents no records whatsoever. Nor does the evidence establish that its funds were maintained separately from those of Kotmair. And, most significantly, there is no evidence from which the Court can determine at what point after Fellowship funds leave the Office in the possession of Kotmair that they cease to be held exclusively as the property of the SAP Fellowship.
The record establishes that Kotmair was entitled to, felt free to, and did, take funds from the Fellowship and use them for his personal sustenance. Kotmair espouses a doctrine that would have funds that he takes to spend for personal use remain the property of the SAP Fellowship. Indeed, in the world according to Kotmair, if he uses Foundation funds for his food, the Foundation ownership extends to the food even as it proceeds through his digestive system. For example:
THE COURT: [W]e are trying to get an understanding of when something belongs to you and when it doesn't. When it belongs to [the SAP Fellowship], so I just want you to try and help me understand that. If you go to the grocery store and you buy Wheaties [with fellowship funds], when is it yours, after you eat it or.
Kotmair: That is a hard question to answer.
THE COURT: That is why we ask it.
Kotmair: If the energy from it goes to the

      And it’s just pure speculation. It’s pure second-guessing. It’s pure,
“Let me guess at what this lawyer could have done better.”

        And, between the two of them, they cannot even tell me how many
first degree murder cases they have tried. I would venture a guess - - I
would venture a guess that Mr. Massey - - Ms. McClusky and Mr. Massey
collectively have tried more first degree murder cases than any lawyers in
the State of Tennessee. If you compared them with lawyers across the
country, I’ll be surprised if there’s any lawyers that have tried more first
degree murder cases than Mr. Massey and Ms. McClusky.

      And it is almost painful when lawyers start attacking other lawyers
and saying - - my goodness. These lawyers did the absolute best they

      did absolutely everything that any reasonable lawyer could have done. And
      a jury found Mr. Cook guilty of first degree murder in another trial.

      unique to Tennessee. I practiced law in Houston for eight years. 23 felony
      courts. Not courts, 23 felony courts that dealt with felony cases.

             In the eight years in the State of Texas, Harris County, Texas, I may
      have seen three or four post-conviction petitions in 23 felony courts in eight
      years. But it’s part of the game - - and I do use the word game - - that goes
      on in Tennessee, goes on in Shelby County, Tennessee.

             A person is tried. A person is tried and convicted by a jury, receives
      excellent representation from his lawyers, and will turn around on a post-
      conviction and sue a lawyer, in essence, and say, “My lawyers did a bad

v.
Odell CORLEY, Defendant-Appellant.

Alan M. Freedman (argued), Carol R. Heise, Evanston, IL, for Defendant-Appellant.
Before ROVNER, WILLIAMS, and SYKES, Circuit Judges.
ROVNER, Circuit Judge.
The defendant-appellant Odell Corley was convicted of a number of charges including bank robbery and capital murder, and was sentenced to death on October 27, 2004. He appeals his convictions and his sentence.
The convictions stemmed from Corley's actions with others on August 27, 2002 in robbing a bank, and killing two persons and paralyzing a third at the bank. The robbery attempt was planned in advance and was to involve Corley and four others, Edward Johnson, Andre McGregor, Danyass Gay and Jeanna Ramsey. The roles each would take in the robbery were defined, with McGregor driving and Corley and Johnson entering the bank, and with disguises which consisted of makeup to lighten their complexions, sunglasses, oversized clothes and a bandana. On August 27, Johnson and Ramsey went to *720 McGregor's house. Corley met them there, and they drove Corley in a blue Cadillac to pick up a tan car which they planned to use for the robbery. They stopped at a gas station, where Corley used a phone to call in a bomb threat against area schools in an effort to divert the police.
Once they arrived at the bank, McGregor parked the tan car in the back and Corley and Johnson approached the bank. Corley entered the bank immediately, but Johnson spotted the security guard inside the bank and froze outside the bank. The security video tape captured much of what happened next. The security guard, Keith Hill, went to the door of the bank as Corley was entering. Corley pushed the door in and fired his .45 caliber semiautomatic handgun at Hill as he entered, shooting Hill twice from close range and leaving him paralyzed. Corley

Reference to several provisions of the Penal Code are necessary to an understanding of the offense involved and the maximum possible term of imprisonment therefor. All acts perrtaining to alcoholic beverages in this State are regulated by the Texas Liquor Control Act, which is divided into two parts. Part II., Articles 667-1 through 667-33, Vernon's Texas Penal Code, deals with malt liquors. Part I., Article 666-1 through 666-58, relates to all other alcoholic beverages, but some of its provisions cover acts involving beer. The following is relevant to the question here:
1. Pertinent terms defined.
Art. 666  3a. Definitions
The following definitions of words and terms shall apply as used in this Act:
(1) "Alcoholic Beverage" shall mean alcohol and any beverage containing more than one-half of one per cent (½ of 1%) of alcohol by volume which is capable of use for beverage purposes, either alone or when diluted.
(5) "Liquor" shall mean any alcoholic beverage containing alcohol in excess of four (4) per centum by weight, unless otherwise indicated. Proof that an alcoholic beverage is alcohol, spirits of wine, whiskey, liquor, wine, brandy, gin, rum, ale, malt liquor, tequila, mescal, habanero, or barreteago shall be prima-facie evidence that the same is liquor as herein defined.
Art. 667  1. Definitions
Where used in this Article unless expressly stated otherwise:
(b) The term "beer" means a malt beverage containing one-half of 1% or more of alcohol by volume and not more than 4% of alcohol by weight, and shall not be inclusive of any beverage designated by label or otherwise by any other name than beer.
Art. 666  23. Dry and wet areas; definitions
Whenever the term "dry area" is used in this Act it shall mean and refer to all counties, justice precincts, incorporated cities or towns wherein the sale of alcoholic beverages had been prohibited by valid local option elections held under the laws of the State in force at the time of the taking effect of Section 20, Article XVI, Constitution of Texas in the year 1919. It likewise shall mean and refer to any such areas where sale of such alcoholic beverages shall be prohibited under the terms of this Act.
The term "wet area" shall mean and refer to all other areas of the State.

Johnson testified that Maffett had stated on March 11 that the

crew was not working fast enough.    In addition, Johnson testified

that Maffett told him that a backhoe was not available for Odom’s

crew.   Maffett also supposedly told Johnson that the crew did not

need a backhoe.   Johnson also testified that Maffett may have

made a statement to the effect that if the men could not work

without a backhoe, “that they just won’t have one at all.”



           Maffett, meanwhile, denied that he had punished the

crew by depriving it of a backhoe.   Maffett testified that such

equipment was not always available for each job, and that

decisions regarding the allocation of equipment, although


                                 4
sometimes left to him, were generally made by his own supervisor,

Paul Nation.    Nation, the assistant superintendent in charge of

street maintenance for the City, testified that Odom’s crew had

not been provided a backhoe either because none were available,

or because no one was available to operate it.           He testified that

the City owned three backhoes; there is evidence in the record

indicating that on most if not all of the dates in question, one

of the backhoes was in the shop, and the other two were being

used by other crews.2



            Odom initially testified that he had been required to

use a jackhammer for approximately eight hours a day on March 14,

15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23, and 24.         On cross examination,

however, he admitted that he had not worked on March 18, and that

his work on March 14 and 15 had not required the use of a

jackhammer.    He also stated that he had only worked about an hour

and a half on March 24 before reporting the injury to his back.



            During treatment for his back injury, Odom was also

diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome.          These conditions

necessitated extensive treatment, including an operation and

physical therapy.     According to Odom, he continues to have

extensive limitations on the use of his hand and back, and is

unable to perform his normal job duties

Waiver
We also conclude that, even if Keith Sr. could have raised the defense of nonparentage under F.L. § 10-346(a)(5), he waived his right to do so under the facts of the instant case. We explain.
In the instant case, MCOCSE filed a Request to File Foreign Child Support Order with the circuit court on January 24, 2007. Included with the filing was a statement of the support amount, arrearages, information about the obligor, and information about the obligee. On January 26, 2007, the clerk of the court sent Keith Sr. a Notice of Filing of Foreign Child Support Order consistent with the provisions of F.L. § 10-344. On February 15, 2007, the twentieth day after notice was sent to Keith Sr., he filed an answer to the Request to File Foreign Child Support Order. In his answer, Keith Sr., acting pro se, stated: "In my defense, I also want the [c]ourt to consider the following facts ... 19 year old son not living with mother supporting himself. Request emancipation from child support payment." The answer did not raise the defense of nonparentage of Diana, nor did it even mention Diana. Shortly thereafter, the clerk set the matter in for a hearing on April 11, 2007.
As previously stated, at the hearing on April 11, 2007, Keith Sr. withdrew his opposition to the registration of the New York support order. Keith Sr. and MCOCSE also signed a Line, filed on April 19, 2007, stating that "[Keith Sr.] withdraws his petition/opposition to registration of the Foreign Support Order." The Line also asked the circuit court to *189 remove the case from the April 11, 2007 hearing calendar. Because Keith Sr. withdrew his opposition to the registration of the New York support order and rescinded his request for a hearing under F.L. § 10-345, he was no longer a "party contesting the validity or enforcement of a registered order or seeking to vacate the registration" under F.L. § 10-346(a), and thus Keith Sr. was not entitled to raise any of the defenses set forth in that section.[9] Moreover, the aforementioned actions of Keith Sr. constituted a failure "to contest the validity or enforcement of the registered order." F.L. § 10-345(b). Consequently, F.L. § 10-345(b) directs that the New

  Before K ANNE, W ILLIAMS, and T INDER, Circuit Judges.
  T INDER, Circuit Judge. The plaintiff/appellee, Raul
Carvajal, was prosecuted in the Southern District of
Florida for money laundering and was acquitted at the
conclusion of a jury trial. He then brought this civil suit
in the Northern District of Illinois against defen-
dant/appellant Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”)
Task Force Officer Louis Dominguez, Jr. for damages,
alleging violations of his constitutional rights in connec-
2                                              No. 07-2598

tion with the criminal prosecution. The Illinois district
court granted Dominguez’s motion for summary judg-
ment in part by dismissing several counts of Carvajal’s
amended complaint, but the court denied the motion with
respect to a count which asserted a Bivens cause of action
alleging a Brady violation. That decision also included a
denial of qualified immunity for Dominguez. This
appeal followed.


                     I. Background
  The relevant facts revolve around Officer Dominguez’s
identification of Carvajal in two undercover money
pickups in Chicago. Chicago DEA Task Force Officer
Wayne Hunter was assisting in an investigation (called
“Operation Double Trouble”) of a Miami-based money
laundering operation in early April 2001. DEA Miami
asked for assistance in arranging two undercover money
pickups in Chicago. DEA Miami provided Hunter with a
cell phone number and a code to be used to arrange the
pickups. The first pickup was to occur on April 16, 2001.
Hunter asked agent Dominguez to do the job. Dominguez
used the cell number to arrange to meet two individuals;
he later identified them as German Matos Ruiz and Raul
Carvajal. Dominguez met with the men for about five
minutes in the midafternoon inside a Cocon

(3) Conspiracy to Commit Grand Larceny
¶ 12. Finally, Smith claims that there is insufficient evidence to support his conviction of conspiracy to commit grand larceny based on Susan's testimony. Smith further contends that the State failed to establish a valid case of conspiracy between him and the driver of the car.
¶ 13. Smith relies on Franklin v. State, 676 So.2d 287 (Miss.1996) to support his claim. In Franklin, Roderick Franklin and Glen Jackson were among a group of five boys who decided to "mess with" an elderly homeless man. Id. at 288. The teenagers threw rocks at and kicked the victim. Shortly thereafter, one of the other three boys in the group left, came back with a gun and shot the victim. Id. All of the boys were convicted of conspiracy to commit murder. Id. Our supreme court, finding that the only evidence of conspiracy in the case was the fact that Franklin and Jackson went with the other boys to "mess with" the victim, overturned their conviction. Id. at 289. The court found this evidence insufficient and held that there was no evidence of a "union of the minds" between the boy who pulled the trigger and the appellants. Id.
¶ 14. Smith properly advances that for there to be a conspiracy, "there must be a recognition on the part of the conspirators that they are entering into a common plan and knowingly intend to further its common purpose." Id. at 288. "The conspiracy agreement need not be formal or express, but may be inferred from the circumstances, particularly by declarations, acts, and conduct of the alleged conspirators." Id. Thus, "the existence of a conspiracy, and a defendant's membership in it, may be proved entirely by circumstantial evidence." Id.
¶ 15. The State's theory of the case was that Smith and the driver of the car had engaged in a prior conspiracy to steal the rims. We find, however, an absence of any evidence of a "union of the minds" of Smith and the driver of the car. As stated earlier in this opinion, when the driver of the car pulled in Susan's driveway, Smith ran and hid behind the house. Clearly if these two parties were acting in concert, Smith would have recognized his co-conspirator. Also, there would have been no reason for Smith to run upon the arrival of his co-conspirator. Further, the evidence is that when Susan came out of the house, Smith

Garcia v. Wilson , 731 F.2d 640, 651 (10th Cir. 1984) (holding that the state

statute of limitations for personal injury actions applies to § 1983 claims),     aff’d ,

471 U.S. 261 (1985).

       In his complaint, Mr. Powell alleged that the defendant Nelson Spear, an

assistant district attorney, violated his constitutional rights by failing to disclose

exculpatory material prior to a preliminary hearing in a robbery prosecution.        See

Brady v. Maryland , 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963) (holding “that the suppression by the

prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due

process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment,

irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution”);      United States v.

Hughes , 33 F.3d 1248, 1251 (10th Cir. 1994) (discussing the elements necessary

to establish a Brady violation). Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, he sought

compensatory and punitive damages.

       Mr. Powell acknowledged that the preliminary hearing at issue occurred on

August 2, 1998. However, he added that he did not discover that the defendant

Mr. Spear withheld the evidence until June 1998, when he received a brief from

the defendants in related civil litigation.    See Rec. doc. 1, at 2 (complaint


                                              -2-
alleging that “in Powell v. Carter . . . it was learned that [Mr.] Spear omitted

exculpatory evidence from the Plaintiff’s Magistrate Court Preliminary

Hearing”).

       In dismissing the complaint as untimely, the district court observed that the

applicable statute of limitations for § 1983 actions in New Mexico is three years

and that the alleged withholding of evidence occurred in August 1995, almost

five years before the date on which Mr. Powell filed the complaint, June 12,

2000. The court also noted that the exculpatory evidence was ultimately admitted

at Mr. Powell’s trial and that Mr. Powell was acquitted of the charges.

Additionally, Mr. Powell acknowledged that the verdict of acquittal was rendered

on January 2, 1996, four and a half years before he filed this action.

       On appeal

The complaint alleges that plaintiff is a corporation engaged in the business of distributing automotive accessories, shipping merchandise to every state in the Union, and defendant a corporation which manufactures radios for automobiles. It is alleged that plaintiff was a distributor of automobile radios manufactured by defendant from 1950 until 1957, when defendant informed plaintiff that its new line of radios (but not the existing models) would not be available to plaintiff as a distributor, and that defendant has since refused to honor plaintiff's orders for new models of radios. It further alleges that defendant has joined, conspired and combined with Arnco Auto Supply Co. and Ellis, Inc., plaintiff's principal competitors, to prevent plaintiff from servicing customers it has acquired over a period of years, and that the principal objective of the combination is to restrict plaintiff in its trade and competition with others.
Defendant argues that because defendant has a right to select the parties with whom he will deal, United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U.S. 300, 39 S.Ct. 465, 63 L.Ed. 992, or even to grant an exclusive distributorship, Packard Motor Car Co. v. Webster Motor Car Co., *397 100 U.S.App.D.C. 161, 243 F.2d 418, the allegations of the complaint do not state any cause of action under the antitrust laws. However, the complaint alleges not merely a refusal to deal with plaintiff, but also that that refusal was in furtherance of a conspiracy between defendant and plaintiff's competitors to restrict competition by plaintiff. As the Colgate case itself points out, the right to select one's customers is not an absolute right. Its use as an instrument in the furtherance of a conspiracy denounced by the antitrust laws brings it within the ban of those laws. Lorain Journal Co. v. United States, 342 U.S. 143, 155, 72 S. Ct. 181, 96 L.Ed. 162. The charge here is that defendant conspired to restrict competition by plaintiff. Defendant cannot avoid the charge by saying that what it did in furtherance of the conspiracy was something which apart from the conspiracy it might have been free to do.
Defendant points out numerous violations of the antitrust laws which the complaint does not allege. It is enough that it charges a combination or conspiracy for one of the purposes denounced by the law, the restraint of trade by the restriction of plaintiff's ability to compete in the automobile radio market by continuing to offer its customers defendant's products. Defendant argues that plaintiff can still

Banking on full scale casinos: The Tribe and its business partners intend to lobby candidates for public office in favor of Las Vegas style casinos opposed by Governor Chiles. The Tribe is engaged in a legal battle to keep the video slot machines the United States Attorney says are illegal. A lawsuit to force government approval of the machines failed in the Supreme Court.

Seminoles gain entry in Caribbean casino: The Tribe has been investing in a casino on the island of St. Maarten. The casino was denied a license to open an Internet site because the Netherlands worried that information about its management company would "hurt the good name" of that nation.

King Bull: A profile of the Tribe's elected leader, Chairman James Billie, from his childhood according to a previously published biography, to his election as Chairman and career as a singer-entertainer, describing him as a leader not without his critics among Tribe members.
The amended complaint did not specify the portions of the news stories disclosing the "confidential," "proprietary," "secret," or "classified" information. However, the pleading identified the information wrongfully solicited by the Times as: distribution of federal money by the Tribe; genealogical information on Tribe members; vendor lists, including sale terms for goods and services; information relating to potential business opportunities and ongoing *314 negotiations; financial condition and operating information concerning the Tribe's businesses; financial documentation and fiscal data relating to actual and proposed Tribe budgets; documentation relating to gaming interests; medical documents relating to Indian Health Services and individual Tribe members; and information regarding Tribe spiritual and ceremonial practices.
Paragraph 11 of the amended complaint sets forth how the Tribe was damaged as a result of the publication of the news stories based on confidential information. The confidential "documentation and information" lost its "value and confidential character once it cease[d] to be confidential"; an "atmosphere of distrust" was created between tribal members and the Tribe; "[d]isruptive and negative changes [occurred] in employment relationships" between the Tribe and "many of its employees"; there arose "an air of suspicion detrimental to employee morale which has also caused interdepartmental communications to be more cumbersome, time consuming and strained"; the Tribe incurred expenses to "strengthen tribal security," including an upgrade of its computer systems; the news stories gave information to the Tribe's business competitors as to how to best "compete with the Tribe and gain competitive advantages"; by characterizing the Tribe as being "`

It is now thoroughly settled that 'disbarment by federal courts does not automatically flow from disbarment by state courts.'  Theard v. United States,  354 U.S. 278, 282, 77 S.Ct. 1274, 1276, 1 L.Ed.2d 1342; Selling v. Radford, 243 U.S. 46, 37 S.Ct. 377, 61 L.Ed. 585; In re MacNeil, 1 Cir.,266 F.2d 167.  Making the thorough examination of the record which these cases require us to undertake, we are constrained to conclude that Judge Hincks's very careful and precisely buttressed judgment marks the extent of the punishment appropriate for this appellant.  Indeed, the two-year suspension of Isserman ordered by Judge Hincks cannot be considered other than severe, particularly in comparison with the actions of Sacher, whose disbarment was found oversevere by the Supreme Court.  On the record Isserman's derelictions seem comparatively mild, justifying four justices of the Supreme Court in their statement, 'What remains is a finding that he was guilty of several unplanned contumacious outbursts during a long and bitter trial.'  In re Disbarment of Isserman, supra, 345 U.S. 286, 294, 73 S.Ct. 676, 680, 97 L.Ed. 1013.1  Hence the two-year suspension should have marked the ending of his punishment.  In actuality he has undergone practical suspension for nearly ten years since the close of the Dennis trial.  No other of the five attorneys in the case has been disbarred or suspended.  Thus the punishment visited on Isserman appears discriminatorily severe and should now be terminated.


2
We note that the court below made reference, as did the New Jersey court, to Isserman's being fined for a statutory offense as a young man and suspended from practice, where the court went out of its way to stress the limited nature of the offense.  In re Isserman, 1928, 6 N.J.Misc. 146, 140 A. 253.  In 1933 the New Jersey Court of Pardons granted him a full pardon.  There is also some suggestion, which seems unclear as well as unproven, that he may not have disclosed these circumstances of record as much as he should.  Compare, however, Mr. Justice Jackson's rebuttal of this point

PER CURIAM:

       Carlton Bronta May appeals the district court’s order construing his Fed. R. Civ.

P. 60(b) motion as an unauthorized, successive 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (2012) motion and

dismissing it for lack of jurisdiction. * Our review of the record confirms that the district

court properly concluded that May’s motion was not a true Rule 60(b) motion but was, in

substance, a successive § 2255 motion, over which it lacked jurisdiction because May

failed to obtain prefiling authorization from this court. See 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(3)(A)

(2012); McRae, 793 F.3d at 397-400. Accordingly, we affirm the district court’s order.

       Additionally, we construe May’s notice of appeal and informal brief as an

application to file a second or successive § 2255 motion. United States v. Winestock, 340

F.3d 200, 208 (4th Cir. 2003). In order to obtain authorization to file a successive § 2255

motion, a prisoner must assert claims based on either:

       (1) newly discovered evidence that . . . would be sufficient to establish by
       clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have
       found the movant guilty of the offense; or

       (2) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral
       review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.

28 U.S.C. § 2255(h). May’s claims do not satisfy either of these criteria. Therefore, we

deny authorization to file a successive § 2255 motion.




       *
          A certificate of appealability is not required to appeal the district court’s
jurisdictional categorization of a “Rule 60(b) motion as an unauthorized successive
[§ 2255 motion].” United States v. McRae, 793 F.3d 392, 400 (4th Cir. 2015).

Susan Hurley
Susan Hurley is President and 100 percent owner of Cable Communications, Inc., an electrical and communications subcontractor. She formed the company in 1987. Ms. Hurley named seven different general contractors which have solicited her for bids on public jobs with WBE requirements but never on private work without such requirements. In 1999, her work was 70 percent public and 30 percent private. The private work was performed directly for companies such as AT & T, Blue Cross, Sears and Ameritech, not for general contractors.
Ms. Hurley stated that on the large public jobs bidding takes place in a sequence, with structural work being bid out and even started first before the inside work, such as electrical, is reached. She has attended bid meetings when the building has been already under construction. Her experience is that contractors will hire WBE subcontractors only up to the minimum requirements, so that by the time they arrive at the electrical work they have already met the requirements and will not consider a small WBE. Instead, they will use a big electrical contractor. This is why Ms. Hurley's company is not hired for the larger WBE projects. A typical project size for her is $50,000.

Rebecca Munoz-Loss
Rebecca Munoz-Loss, started her own carpentry contracting firm, C.L. Beck Co., in 1996. She owned 70 percent of the company and her husband, Charles Loss, owned 30 percent. He had worked for ten years as a carpenter for the Chicago Public Schools. Ms. Munoz-Loss had been working for an office supply company.
C.L. Beck is certified as both an MBE and a WBE by the Chicago Public School system. In 1999, 98 percent of the company's jobs were subcontracts for carpentry work on Chicago Public School projects.
Ms. Munoz-Loss looks for private work and passes out cards and introductory letters at job fairs. But she is only solicited to make bids on public work.
The company has never been certified by the County of Cook as an MBE or WBE. It has worked on only one Cook County job, a clinic at Cook County Hospital.

Robert A. Salvitore
Robert A. Salvitore is General Manager of Alvarez Corp., a Hispanic-owned building and landscaping contractor. Alvarez is certified as an MBE with various government agencies, but not with the County of Cook. Its 1999 revenues were $1

       as a result. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984). Where a claim of ineffective

       assistance can be disposed of because the defendant suffered no prejudice, we need not

       determine whether counsel’s performance was deficient. See People v. Griffin, 178 Ill. 2d 65, 74

       (1997).

¶ 14             Turning to the prejudice prong of the Strickland standard, the defendant argues the trial

       court would have barred Blair and the victims’ identification testimony because the police failed

                                                          3
       to comply with section 115-9(b) of the Code. “[I]n order to establish prejudice under Strickland,

       the defendant must demonstrate that the unargued suppression motion is meritorious, and that a

       reasonable probability exists that the trial outcome would have been different had the evidence

       been suppressed.” People v. Henderson, 2013 IL 114040, ¶ 15. In the present context, to show

       prejudice the defendant must demonstrate that trial counsel’s motion to bar Blair and the victims’

       identification testimony would have been granted and the outcome of the trial would have been

       different had the evidence been barred.

¶ 15          To determine whether the motion to bar would have been granted, we must consider

       whether section 115-9 provides a basis to bar evidence at trial. See 725 ILCS 5/115-9 (West

       2010). We first observe that section 115-9 of the Code governs the admissibility of photographic

       evidence (not witness testimony). In particular, section 115-9(a) provides:

                      “(a) In a prosecution for theft, retail theft, deceptive practice, robbery, armed

                      robbery, burglary or residential burglary, the court shall receive as competent

                      evidence, a photograph of property over which the accused is alleged to have

                      exerted unauthorized control or to have otherwise obtained unlawfully, if the

                      photograph:

                             (1) will serve the purpose of demonstrating the nature of the property; and

                             (2) is otherwise admissible into evidence under all other rules of law

                      governing the admissibility of photographs into evidence. The fact that it is

                      impractical to introduce into evidence the actual property for any reason,

                      including its size, weight, or unavailability, need not be established for the court

                      to find a

The appellant asserts in her first point of error that the trial court erred in entering its second judgment because this judgment did not specifically vacate the "final judgment" rendered in open court on January 26, 1981. Appellant argues that there can be only one final judgment and because the written order did not specifically vacate the oral judgment, it is a nullity and the oral judgment should be the recognized order.
In support of her position, appellant cites Dunn v. Dunn, 439 S.W.2d 830 (Tex. 1969) for the proposition that an oral rendition of judgment in the settlement of the rights of parties is a valid final judgment. We agree that such a pronouncement is a valid judgment so long as it is not set aside. However, the court has power to set aside its judgment so long as the time for filing a motion for new trial has not expired. Tex. R.Civ.Pro. 306 establishes that the date of signing of the judgment or order is the date from which the time to file a motion for new trial or to appeal is measured. Within thirty days after the date of signing, the trial court has plenary power to grant a new trial or to vacate, modify, correct, or reform its judgment. Tex.R.Civ.Pro. 329b(d). An oral judgment does not put into motion any time constraints from which a motion for new trial is measured. Consequently, the trial court's written order setting aside its previous oral judgment was not an abuse of discretion.
Appellant insists that the second judgment, itself, must contain language which specifically vacates the earlier judgment. We disagree. It is only necessary for the record to indicate that a subsequent judgment vacates and replaces a former judgment. Mullins v. Thomas, 136 Tex. 215, 150 S.W.2d 83 (Tex.1941); Tunnell v. Otis Elevator, 404 S.W.2d 307 (Tex.1966). However, all of the cases applying this principle involve multiple written judgments, each of which had been signed and entered of record. While that is not the situation in the present case, the record does reflect, through a docket entry and letter, that the trial court intended to vacate and reform his earlier oral judgment.
The first point of error is overruled.
Appellant's second point of error alleges that the trial court abused its discretion in the rendition of its second judgment by failing to protect the appellant's contingent interest in appellee's pension plan.
The trial court prescribed

        On July 21, 2014 the juvenile court continued the disposition hearing as to Brian
and Joseph and the 18-month review hearing as to Steven and Genesis to August 20,
2014.
        In a filing submitted on August 20, 2014 the Department stated it had received the
DIF assessment, which reported that Miguel was gainfully employed and his home was
adequate, well furnished and had ample space. Miguel told DIF he wished to regain
custody of all four children, but would respect the decision of Brian and Joseph if they
preferred to remain in the United States. Brian and Joseph again told the social worker
they did not want to live with Miguel in Mexico.
        On August 20, 2014 the juvenile court conducted the disposition hearing as to
Brian and Joseph and ordered the two children removed from their parents and suitably
placed. The court continued the 18-month review hearing as to Steven and Genesis to
October 21, 2014 for a contested hearing and ordered the Department to submit a
supplemental report addressing possible placement of Steven and Genesis with Miguel in
Mexico.
        4. The 18-month Permanency Review Hearing for Steven and Genesis
        In its supplemental report the Department acknowledged that DIF had concluded
Miguel’s living situation was adequate and he was ready to care for his children, but
determined it was not in the best interests of Steven and Genesis to be released to Miguel.
The Department observed that both children stated they had not had any relationship with
Miguel since he separated from Maria; he had not provided for their emotional or
financial needs; and he had not maintained communication with them or with Maria. The
Department added that Steven and Genesis stated they wished to return to Maria’s care or,
if that was not possible, to live with a maternal aunt in Nevada. On September 20, 2014
the juvenile court ordered the Department to initiate an interstate compact investigation of
the maternal aunt.
        On October 21, 2014 the Department advised that Maria tested positive for
methamphetamine on August 25, 2014. The Department recommended the court

section 366.26 for Steven and Genesis. On October 21, 2014 the court continued the
18-month review hearing to December 11, 2014.
       On December 11, 2014 the Department reported that the maternal aunt’s home was

The United States appeals from a judgment rendered against it under the Tort Claims Act based on a determination by the trial court that negligence of the United States caused the death by electrocution of a painter engaged in painting the inside of a building at the United States Naval Air Station at Corpus Christi, Texas.  The government also appeals from the dismissal of its third party claim against Percivill's employer, Phoenix Painting Company, a partnership and the individual partners.  We have carefully read the elaborate findings of fact by the trial court and conclude that there was ample basis for a determination of liability on the part of the United States in the tort action against it.


2
The third party action was tried at the same time as the tort claim, but it was tried to a jury.  The jury was unable to agree and thereupon the trial court declared a mistrial.  At the plaintiffs' request, before entering the order for a mistrial, the trial court severed the third party action and then entered an order purporting to be a final judgment in the tort claim action in favor of the plaintiffs and against the United States.


3
Following the order of severance it came to the notice of the trial court that this court in United States v. Seckinger, 5 Cir., 408 F.2d 146 had held that under such circumstances as existed in this litigation, the United States could not recover over against the employer of the injured party.  Thereupon, the trial court entered an order dismissing the third party claim by the United States against Phoenix.  The United States then appealed from both judgments, the judgment against it in the tort claim action and the order of dismissal of its third party claim against Phoenix.

Pending the appeal, the United States Supreme Court has reversed the judgment of this court in United States v. Seckinger, 1970, 397 U.S. 203, 90 S.Ct. 880, 25 L.Ed.2d 224.  It is thus apparent that the judgment of the trial court dismissing the third party action on behalf of the United States against Phoenix must be reversed.


5
We conclude that since the trial court severed the third party action from the principal claim by the plaintiffs against the United States, this made a final judgment of the court's judgment in the tort claim action, leaving for a separate and distinct trial the claim of the government against Phoenix.

In affirming the tort claim case, we do so

*489 (b) Payment shall be made for all wages earned to a date not more than ten (10) business days prior to the date of payment. However, this subsection does not prevent payments being made at shorter intervals than specified in this subsection, nor repeal any law providing for payments at shorter intervals. However, if an employee voluntarily leaves employment, either permanently or temporarily, the employer shall not be required to pay the employee an amount due the employee until the next usual and regular day for payment of wages, as established by the employer. If an employee leaves employment voluntarily, and without the employee's whereabouts or address being known to the employer, the employer is not subject to section 2 of this chapter until:
(1) ten (10) business days have elapsed after the employee has made a demand for the wages due the employee; or
(2) the employee has furnished the employer with the employee's address where the wages may be sent or forwarded.
Ind.Code § 22-2-5-1.
If an employer fails to make payment of wages in accordance with this chapter, then the employer must,
as liquidated damages for such failure, pay to such employee for each day that the amount due to him remains unpaid ten percent (10%) of the amount due to him in addition thereto, not exceeding double the amount of wages due, and said damages may be recovered in any court having jurisdiction of a suit to recover the amount due to such employee, and in any suit so brought to recover said wages or the liquidated damages for nonpayment thereof, or both, the court shall tax and assess as costs in said case a reasonable fee for the plaintiff's attorney or attorneys.
Ind.Code § 22-2-5-2.
Kelley argues, and the district court held, that the Treats should have proceeded under Indiana Code § 22-2-9-1 et seq., entitled "Wage Claims," which we refer to as the Wage Claims Statute. This statute provides in relevant part:
Discharge of employee; unpaid wages; payment; labor disputes
Sec. 2. (a) Whenever any employer separates any employee from the pay-roll, the unpaid wages or compensation of such employee shall become due and payable at regular pay day for pay period in which separation occurred....
Disputes; payment of amount agreed upon
Sec. 3. In case of a dispute over wages, the employer shall give notice to the employee of the amount of wages which he concedes

      Muhammad attached to his complaint a Request to Staff form he submitted

dated October 7, 2003, regarding inmate mistreatment. ROA, Doc. 1, Ex. C. He

attached a second Request to Staff form dated October 10, 2003, regarding

retaliation by the same defendant based on allegations that the defendant

submitted a misconduct report against Muhammad for smoking. ROA, Doc. 1,

Ex. E. The record indicates that prison officials reviewed and responded to both

forms, but that Muhammad did not file a grievance form or take any further action

in the grievance process. Accordingly, these forms do not demonstrate that

Muhammad exhausted the entire administrative remedy available to him. See

Jernigan, 304 F.3d at 1032.

      Muhammad also attached to his complaint a letter he wrote to Senator

Harry Coats regarding the treatment of inmates, two Request to Staff forms

submitted by another inmate, Ricky Smith, and another Request to Staff form he

submitted after being transferred to OSP regarding personal property lost during

his transfer. These also fail to demonstrate that Muhammad exhausted his

remedies.

      It should also be noted that in subsequent filings, Muhammad included

copies of two appeals he lodged regarding his disciplinary convictions for

smoking and bartering. The facility head denied his appeals. Although

Muhammad appears to have exhausted his administrative remedies regarding

these convictions, Muhammad has failed to meet the “total exhaustion”

requirement of § 1997e(a). See Ross, 365 F.3d at 1188-89.

      Though Muhammad argues that defendants ignore and refuse to address

inmates’ request and grievance forms, Muhammad has failed to present any

evidence to support this contention. In fact, disciplinary convictions aside, the

record is devoid of any evidence that Muhammad even attempted to proceed to

the second step in the grievance process regarding any of his claims.

Accordingly, the district court did not err in dismissing Muhammad’s complaint

without prejudice.

PER CURIAM:

      Erdogan Gulsoy, a native and citizen of Turkey, petitions

for   review    of    an    order    of    the    Board    of   Immigration     Appeals

dismissing his appeal from the immigration judge’s (IJ) order

denying his motion for a continuance and finding him removable.

We deny the petition for review.

      An IJ “may grant a motion for continuance for good cause

shown.”     8 C.F.R. § 1003.29 (2015).                  We review the denial of a

motion for a continuance for abuse of discretion.                             Lendo v.

Gonzales, 493 F.3d 439, 441 (4th Cir. 2007).                        We “must uphold

the IJ’s denial of a continuance unless it was made without a

rational explanation, it inexplicably departed from established

policies,      or    it     rested    on     an     impermissible      basis,     e.g.,

invidious discrimination against a particular race or group.”

Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).

      We conclude that the IJ properly considered the denial of a

prior I-130 visa petition as he considered the viability of the

pending I-130 visa petition.               In re Hashmi, 24 I. & N. Dec. 785,

other evidence of potential fraud or dilatory tactics may impact

the viability of the visa petition underlying the motion.”                       Id.

CHAMP'S REFUSAL TO REINSTATE STRIKERS FOR ALLEGED MISCONDUCT


50
Champ argues that it properly refused to reinstate unfair labor practice strikers, Jose Villavicencio, Carlos Almoroz, Joe Solis, and Ramon Rodriguez, for strike-related misconduct.


51
After the strikers unconditionally offered to return to work, Champ refused to reinstate eleven of the unfair labor practice strikers, including the four mentioned above, for alleged strike misconduct.  Between May 5 and May 7, 1980 Champ obtained a list of strikers with pending criminal charges from the police department.  The list contained the names of the 11 discharged strikers.  On May 30, 1980 Champ requested that the persons on the list report to the personnel office.  Champ gave each employee a letter stating "You currently have pending criminal charges with the District Attorney's Office for STRIKE-RELATED CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS.  You are therefore, ineligible for work reinstatement.  Should your arrest(s) be considered false, your reinstatement will be reconsidered at that time."    Ed Simovich instructed the strikers that they clear up their records before they could be reinstated.  At this time, Champ made no mention of any strike-related misconduct other than that which resulted in criminal charges.  In fact, Champ failed to mention any other misconduct until the hearing before the ALJ.


52
On June 6, 1980, Champ sent another letter to the group indicating that they were on indefinite suspension status.  The letter stated "[w]e are looking deeply into your pending criminal charges which resulted from your arrest(s) for strike-related violence."    On October 31, 1980 Champ sent a final letter to Villavicencio, Almoroz, and Rodriguez stating that they had been terminated for "strike-related criminal violence."    The letter made no mention of any misconduct other than the pending criminal charges.


53
Based upon these facts, the ALJ concluded that Champ improperly refused to reinstate the strikers.  The ALJ provided several reasons for this holding.  The ALJ found that the only reason provided by Champ up until the time of the hearing for refusing to reinstate the employees was that criminal charges were pending against them.  Champ had not relied upon any of the other alleged acts of misconduct.  The ALJ concluded that Champ's delay in bringing

This court held that the ordinance was overbroad, because it was "far more than a regulation limited to and contained by the consequences the law seeks to prevent." Id. at 556, 761 P.2d 510.
Purcell demonstrates that a selective time, place, and manner restriction is not a content restrictionthat is, is not facially invalidmerely because the restriction is selective. Rather, a selective time, place, and manner restriction belongs in the second of the three categories enumerated in Robertson: laws that purport to focus on effects but that expressly prohibit expression used to achieve those effects. Such a law must be analyzed for overbreadth.
In addition to departing from our precedent, the majority's reasoning might encroach on the proper analysis in other cases. An example will demonstrate why. ORS 260.695(2) prohibits electioneering near a polling place:
"No person, within any building in which a polling place is located or within 100 feet measured radially from any entrance to the building, shall do any electioneering, including circulating any cards or hand bills, or soliciting signatures to any petition. No person shall do any electioneering by public address system located more than 100 feet from an entrance to the building but capable of being understood within 100 feet of the building. The electioneering need not relate to the election being conducted."
That is a time, place, and manner restriction on speech. It also is a content-selective time, place, and manner restriction; petitioner could solicit customers for his chimney sweep business within 100 feet of a polling place, for example.
Under the majority's analysis, ORS 260.695(2) is directed at the substance of speech, because it restricts some subjects of communication (electioneering) but not others. In my view, however, that statute is a law focusing on a forbidden effect (disruption of voting), which expressly prohibits expression used to achieve that effect. Under State v. Robertson, supra, *1291 293 Or. at 417-18, 649 P.2d 569, such a law falls into the second analytical category; it is not facially invalid, but it must be scrutinized to be sure that it is not overbroad. The selective nature of the time, place, and manner restrictions in ORS 260.695(2) is simply one factor to consider in that scrutiny.[2]
Likewise, here, ORS 759.290 is not impermiss

While serving a thirty-year sentence for murder in a Florida state penitentiary, Gregory Zaetler pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit access device fraud and wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Secs. 1029(a)(2), 1029(b)(2), 1343, and 371.  He was sentenced to ten months in prison, to be served concurrently with the Florida sentence, and to two years of supervised release, to be served upon his release from prison.  Zaetler's federal sentence began on June 14, 1991.


2
In June of 1992 Zaetler filed a motion in the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255, seeking credit against his federal sentence for time he spent in federal custody prior to sentencing.  If given such credit (which the parties agree amounts to 212 days), Zaetler's term of incarceration for his federal offenses would have expired in July of 1991 rather than in April of 1992.  The court dismissed this motion for want of jurisdiction, finding that Zaetler had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.  In October of 1992, after exhausting his administrative remedies (and failing to obtain the relief he sought), Zaetler filed a second Sec. 2255 motion with the district court seeking the same credit toward his federal sentence.  The court denied the motion because 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3585(b) provides that a defendant shall be given credit for the time he has spent in official detention prior to the date his sentence commences only if that time has not been credited against another sentence, and Zaetler had received credit on his state sentence for the time he spent in federal custody prior to the date his federal sentence commenced.  Zaetler appeals.


3
Zaetler completed his ten-month term of incarceration for his federal offenses six months before he brought this action in the district court.  Thus the subject of this litigation--whether Zaetler should receive 212 days' credit against his federal sentence--is not a live case or controversy.  See North Carolina v. Rice, 404 U.S. 244, 248 (1971).  The unsatisfied two-year period of supervised release does not preserve a case or controversy between Zaetler and the United States because Zaetler must serve the supervised release portion of his federal sentence upon his release from the Florida state penitentiary whether he completed his term of incarceration for

Raytheon seeks to avoid this ruling by asserting that the Second Mechanic's Lien is not an amendment of the Original Mechanic's Lien, but is, instead, an independent mechanic's lien. It notes that the Second Mechanic's Lien was filed within four months of the completion of work on the project[2] and otherwise complies with all the requirements of the statute. Raytheon's argument is, of course, belied by the fact that the Second Mechanic's Lien is expressly delineated by Raytheon itself as a "Clarification" of the Original Mechanic's Lien and is in the same exact amount as the Original Mechanic's Lien ($12,006,779). (Raytheon Appendix at Exhibits A and B.) The only changes were the dates when the work was completed and the property against which the lien was asserted. Raytheon is not asserting two claims in the amount of $12 million each; it is clear that the second filing was intended to replace, or amend, the original filing.
Thus, we conclude that the Second Mechanic's Lien was an attempted amendment of the Original Mechanic's Lien. As such, it is an impermissible amendment and is not valid against the Debtor as a third party judgment creditor or bona fide purchaser under section 544.
B. Improper Property Description
Under section 6 0/7 of the Illinois Mechanic's Lien Act, to create a valid lien, the claim for lien must be filed against the property on which the "building, erection or other improvement to be charged with *720 the lien is situated" and must include a "sufficiently correct description of the lot, lots or tracts of land to identify the same." 770 ILCS 60/7.
The Original Mechanic's Lien identified "Lot 8 in the Acme Forest View Subdivision," with an address of "13414 Wentworth Avenue, Riverdale, Illinois," as the property against which Raytheon was asserting a lien. The Plant which Raytheon built for the Debtor, however, was not built on that lot, but on contiguous lots. (Declaration of Capito dated March 17, 2000; Declaration of Nowicki dated March 17, 2000.)
In response, Raytheon asserts that the property description in a mechanic's lien need not be exact or legally precise. Raytheon cites to a seminal decision of the Illinois Supreme Court which held:
Acts giving mechanic's

Cohen also argues that he was acquitted of the bribery charge in count 12 and, therefore, should have been acquitted of giving a gratuity to a public official (count 13). This contention is without merit because the gratuity count, unlike bribery, requires no corrupt intent — it is a lesser form of bribery. See United States v. Umans, supra.


Improper Joinder


11
All of the crimes charged were of the same character. Rule 8 (F.R.Crim.Proc.) authorizes joinder of counts in such a situation. No objection to the joinder or motion for a severance was made, although defendant was represented by able trial counsel. Furthermore, the testimony admitted was properly admissible on the aiding and abetting counts.


The Charge


12
Quite apart from failure to take objections to, and absence of "plain error" in, the charge, Cohen's appellate points are not well taken. Cohen did have "the greatest stake in the outcome of the trial" and the trial court's charge as to possible motive on Cohen's part to fabricate was entirely proper, particularly when coupled with instructions that the jury could also accept Cohen's version of the facts if they chose to do so.


13
The other objections to the charge now raised on appeal — but as to which no trial objections were taken — involve:


14
(1) criminal intent under the gratuity count (similar charge approved in United States v. Irwin, 354 F.2d 192, 197 n. 3 (2 Cir., 1965);


15
(2) criminal intent under the aiding and abetting counts (somewhat similar situation in United States v. Umans, supra);


16
(3) inferences available to the jury from failure to call an available witness who may have had favorable information (see United States v. Comulada, 340 F.2d 449, 452 (2 Cir., 1965)); and


17
(4) the immateriality of the correctness of the tax returns of Cohen's clients.


18
Analysis of these objections justifies the conclusion that the trial court committed no reversible error.


Improper Admission of Testimony


19
The jury could have drawn an inference from Cohen's self-introduction to an auditor "as a friend of Gilbert Sherman" that he was to be considered persona grata to the auditor co-defendant. The auditor's elabor

The affidavits also show, however, that GTWP did not bill

petitioners for any of these services or for any of the

after petitioners filed their motion for reasonable litigation

petitioners to provide additional support for their claimed

costs.11   Ms. West’s affidavit states:   “These invoices have been

incurred but not yet been paid by Victor and Judith A.

     Petitioners have not persuaded us that they were legally

obligated, or were even expected, to pay the invoiced amounts.

Indeed, petitioners represent that “any fees and expenses paid by

the Internal Revenue Service to the Petitioners will promptly be

paid to Grigoraci, Trainer, Wright & Paterno.”    From this

statement, and absent any suggestion to the contrary, we infer

that petitioners will not pay any expenses to GTWP unless and

MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
KENNEDY, District Judge.
Sara Lee Corp. files this action under the Employee Retirement Income Security *41 Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. §§ 1001 et seq., challenging certain acts and practices of American Bakers Association Retirement Plan and its Board of Trustees (collectively, the "ABA Plan"), and seeking judicial review of a 2006 determination of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. ("PBGC"). The ABA Plan has filed a counterclaim against Sara Lee, a cross-claim against PBGC, and a third-party complaint against the American Bakers Association and other participants in the ABA Plan, including Lewis Brothers Bakeries, Inc. ("Lewis Brothers"), seeking declaratory relief resolving the contradiction between a 1979 PBGC determination and the 2006 determination.
Before the court is the motion by defendants ABA Plan to dismiss Counts II and III of Sara Lee Corp.'s second amended complaint [# 16] and third-party defendant Lewis Brothers' motion for leave to file an amended answer, a counterclaim against the ABA Plan, and a cross-claim against defendant PBGC [# 77].[1] Upon consideration of the motions, the oppositions thereto, and the record in this case, the court concludes that (1) the ABA Plan's motion to dismiss counts II and III must be granted; and

The defendant claims that on the morning alleged, he finished work at the Ford Rouge plant and punched out at 7:10 a.m. He walked to the main gate and took a bus to the corner of Linwood and Davidson, where he got off and attempted to cash a check. *328 The A & P store not having opened, and the barber shop where he had intended to wait until the store opened also being closed, he caught another bus to the area in which he lived. After alighting from the bus he proceeded to the house in which the complainant claims the act took place, and about 8:30 a.m. talked to a friend about taking care of the house while said friend was away. He left the house and met another friend about 9 or 9:15 a.m. and spent the time with him until approximately 11 o'clock a.m. He denies that he saw the complaining witness on the morning of the alleged offense and denies that he committed the offense. It is his claim that the complainant was angry and resentful toward him because he had reprimanded her, and that the girl had been punished by her mother for not keeping up with her school work and for visiting a house of ill repute.
The trial judge found the defendant guilty, and the defendant moved for a new trial which was denied. The grounds alleged for the new trial were: judgment is contrary to the great weight of the evidence; judgment is contrary to law; and testimony of the complaining witness was false. Subsequently, the defendant filed a supplemental pleading to the motion for a new trial, alleging grounds that there was newly-discovered evidence which should be presented in a new trial.
The motions were denied and the defendant appeals to this Court on the same grounds. The appellant, in effect, claims in the first 3 grounds presented for a new trial, that the trial judge should have believed the appellant instead of the complaining witness. The testimony of the defendant and his witnesses is at variance with that of the people's witnesses. There is only one common agreement in the testimony of the two sides: both sides *329 put the appellant at the same house and talking to a friend at approximately 8:30 a.m. As stated in People v. Szymanski (1948), 321 Mich 248, at pp 253, 254:
"As the trier of the facts it became the duty of the trial judge to determine the credibility of the witnesses and decide the disputed issue. It is apparent that he believed the testimony

      "Joseph E. Gorman."
*211 The official minutes of the Board of Commissioners for June 27, 1944, show the Mayor's appointment of the defendant:
"Special Reports * * *.
"Mayor Lowe reported that Harold J. Jones had been appointed as Special Patrolman; that this is a temporary appointment and can be terminated at any time in accordance with the ordinance."
The official payroll of the police department for the period from June 16th to June 30th, 1944, listed the defendant as a special patrolman and showed that no pension deduction was made from his pay. It is significant to note here that the form of defendant's appointment and his payroll status was the same as that of Special Patrolman Boercherer, who was appointed as such in 1942 and was not dropped from the force until after April, 1947, when men in military service came back to their work.
The defendant continued to perform his duties and was carried on the payroll as a special patrolman for almost three years, until April, 1947. In that month Mayor Lowe, who was still Director of the Department of Public Safety, appointed the defendant as a permanent member of the police force, retroactive to June 16, 1944. Prior to this appointment defendant had taken a competitive examination for patrolman and rated No. 1. Defendant's appointment is evidenced by the following extract from the minutes of the Board of Commissioners for April 8, 1947:
"Communications * * *
"1. From Mayor Lowe advising of the appointment of Harold J. Jones as a permanent member of the Ridgefield Park Police Department with rank of patrolman, such appointment to be retroactive to June 16, 1944, the date he originally joined the Department. Communication ordered filed for record."
The defendant was thereafter carried on the payroll as a patrolman and pension deductions were made from his pay. In the pretrial order it was admitted that the defendant is not a *212 veteran and that at the time of this appointment he was 33 years of age.
All of these facts, except those shown by the official records of the village or admitted in the pretrial order, were introduced in evidence by the testimony of the defendant, Mayor Lowe, the Chief of Police, and the Village Clerk, over the objection of the plaintiff.
The plaintiff commenced this action by filing an information in June, 1948, alleging that the defendant's appointment as a patrolman was illegal and void, in that he was 33 years old at the time and not a veteran, whereas

Mary’s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506–08 (1993). Without an inference that

Cange‟s national origin motivated her employer‟s action, there was no basis for the

District Court to apply a mixed-motive analysis, as the District Court itself recognized

when it rescinded its mixed-motive jury charge.

       Even were we to determine that Cange prosecuted her discrimination claims under

a mixed-motive theory, we agree with the District Court that her evidence was

                                             5
insufficient. See, e.g., Lightning Lube, Inc., 4 F.3d at 1166. Cange presented no direct

evidence to suggest that her national origin was a motivating factor in her termination.

To the extent that Cange attempted to claim discrimination through circumstantial

evidence of the PPA‟s treatment of other employees, we find no fault with the District

Court‟s conclusion that there was insufficient evidence. To suggest that Cange‟s national

origin was a motivating factor in her supervisor‟s decision to terminate her employment,

she points to the treatment of two other employees, Kim Earland and James Aria. The

record reveals, however, significant factors that distinguished Cange‟s case from

Earland‟s and Aria‟s. The evidence showed, for example, that Aria was asleep while on

break – Cange admitted that she was sleeping while on duty. In Earland‟s case, the PPA

could not conclusively determine that she was asleep while on duty. In pointing to the

treatment received by these two individuals, Cange does not highlight evidence that

would permit a reasonable jury to find her national origin to be a motivating factor in her

ultimate termination.

       Having considered the entire record here, we conclude that Cange was unable to

identify a similarly situated comparator. She, therefore, presented insufficient evidence

to permit a jury to find that her national origin was a motivating factor in her employment

termination.

                                            IV.

       Lastly, Cange challenges the District Court‟s admission of evidence concerning

the PPA‟s termination of Michael Davis, a non-Haitian, white employee who was fired

for sleeping on the job. Cange argued that the District

*252 Before Judges PRESSLER, LANDAU and NEWMAN.
Brian C. Bartlett, attorney for appellant.
Kelaher, Garvey, Ballou & Van Dyke, attorneys for respondent (Peter J. Van Dyke, on the brief).
The decision of the court was delivered by LANDAU, J.A.D.
This appeal by plaintiff Jason Standard is from a summary judgment entered in favor of defendants Anthony E. Vas, Marie N. Domingues, and the New Jersey Automobile Full Insurance Underwriting Association, dismissing plaintiff's automobile accident negligence complaint as time-barred under N.J.S.A. 2A:14-2, despite the tolling provisions of N.J.S.A. 2A:14-21.
We reverse because the motion judge failed to afford to the Supreme Court's opinion in Green v. Auerbach Chevrolet Corp., 127 N.J. 591, 606 A.2d 1093 (1992), the "prospective application" contemplated by that case and subsequent judicial decisions. Analysis of the authorities, however, prompts us to attempt to clarify interpretation of what properly constitutes "prospective application" in varying fact patterns.
The facts in the present case are undisputed. Plaintiff was born January 13, 1972. On February 18, 1991, at the age of nineteen, *253 he was injured in the accident which is the subject of this action, filed November 12, 1993.
In Apgar v. Lederle Laboratories, 123 N.J. 450, 454-455, 588 A.2d 380 (1991), the Supreme Court recognized the existence of twenty years of uncertainty respecting the effect of L. 1972, c. 81, 87 (N.J.S.A. 9:17B-1 et seq.), which lowered the age of majority from twenty-one years to eighteen years, upon the legislatively unamended N.J.S.A. 2A:14-21. Despite enactment of L. 1972, c. 81, 87, the latter statute has continued to provide for tolling, inter alia, the two-year limitation for commencing a personal injury action (N.J.S.A. 2A:14-2), in cases where the right accrues while the plaintiff is under twenty-one, to permit commencement of the action "within such time as limited by said sections [

The Bail Reform Act of 1984 made it much more difficult for a convicted criminal defendant to obtain his release pending appeal.   The Act's intent "was, bluntly, that fewer convicted persons remain at large while pursuing their appeals."  United States v. Powell, 761 F.2d 1227, 1231 (8th Cir.1985) (en banc).   For crimes of the type committed by Marshall, release pending appeal now requires that the district court or this court find (A) by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant is unlikely to flee or pose a danger to others, and (B) that his appeal "raises a substantial question of law or fact" that is likely to result in reversal, new trial, or reduction to a sentence that would be served before disposition of the appeal.  18 U.S.C. § 3143(b)(1)(A) & (B).


3
The district court ignored requirement (B), giving as reasons for Marshall's release only that he is "not a risk to flee," that detention "would be very, very harsh and restrictive on you," and "that the appeal can be handled relatively quickly."   This was error.   Moreover, Marshall did not satisfy requirement (B) in his statement of position to this court;  indeed, he did not even identify what issues he will raise on appeal.   We require a showing that the appeal presents "a close question"--not "simply that reasonable judges could differ"--on a question "so integral to the merits of the conviction that it is more probable than not that reversal or a new trial will occur if the question is decided in the defendant's favor."  Powell, 761 F.2d at 1234.   Thus, Marshall must be detained pending appeal.


4
The district court order releasing Milton Gary Marshall pending appeal is reversed.   The case is remanded for the limited purpose of imposing an appropriate detention order.   This partial remand does not affect Marshall's pending appeal.

 Alternatively, the government could have filed a detention motion under F.R.A.P. 9(b) in Marshall's pending appeal.   In either case, our review of the release/detention question is governed procedurally by 18 U.S.C. § 3145(c) and F.R.A.P. 9(a).   The parties have provided us with statements of position, a copy of the district court

 A day or two later, appellant came to the savings and loan office with $30,000 in cash to cover Mrs. Stewart's check in the event bank examiners should appear. White gave him a receipt for the money. On August 30 appellant demanded the money back and White gave it to him. The next day, Mr. and Mrs. Stewart went to the police.
 The police questioned everyone. Appellant's story was that he had been employed and paid $1,250 to investigate Mr. Stewart; that he had arranged a loan for Mrs. Stewart in the amount of $30,000 from Mr. White, and that he had not seen her since. Baird told substantially the same story. As appellant and Baird left the Hall of Justice, after being questioned, they met White and gave him a ride home. They stopped at the savings and loan offices and secured and destroyed copies of the receipt White had given appellant when the latter brought in $30,000 in cash to cover Mrs. Stewart's check. Critically for appellant, however, they failed to destroy one of the copies of the receipt.
 The White Case
 The facts in this case illuminate the strange behavior of White in the Stewart case, because some of the events in White's case took place before Mrs. Stewart parted with her money on August 24th at appellant's office.
 White was treasurer of a savings and loan association. Early in June 1965 he spent an evening drinking in various bars. About 2 a.m. he set out to find a homosexual companion. He met Thompson, a 19-year-old drug addict. They engaged in a homosexual act at the savings and loan offices. White paid Thompson $25 to keep quiet. White asked Thompson to return on Saturday when the offices would be closed, and Thompson agreed. Thompson returned and White gave him $20, although no homosexual acts took place. Thereafter Thompson came back several times demanding larger sums of money from White and threatening to expose him.
 White consulted appellant, who agreed to take White's case. *373 White paid appellant $900, $600 and $2,600 at different times. Later, when White saw Thompson near the savings and loan offices, he called appellant and gave him a description of Thompson. Appellant and Baird quickly appeared. They accosted Thompson and pretended to be "undercover" police, and acted as if to arrest Thompson and take him to the Hall of Justice. They drove Thompson around in their car for a time, and then returned

ORDER

1
Henry Lee Griffin, Sr. pleaded guilty to one count of possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).  He was sentenced to serve a term of 63 months.  His sentence was based, in large part, on a district court finding that he was responsible for--as relevant conduct under the sentencing guidelines--5.6 grams of crack.  Griffin appeals that finding but can prevail only if we conclude it is clearly erroneous.


2
Mr. Griffin will not be a candidate for any family values awards.  No matter which way the evidence is viewed, he and his son, Henry Lee Griffin, Jr., were involved in a drug transaction.


3
On June 27, 1994, a Carbondale, Illinois, police officer, Mark Wilson, was patrolling on a bicycle when he spotted two men in what he believed was a drug transaction.  Wilson subsequently testified that he didn't know either of the men but that one was taller and younger.  According to Wilson, the older and shorter man passed several baggies of what the officer thought was crack cocaine to the younger fellow.  The men then spotted the officer and took off running in different directions.  Eventually the two got together and hopped into a car, with pop at the wheel and the son in the back.  While driving, the two changed shirts, apparently to confuse the pursuing gendarme.  Eventually police stopped the car.  A search of the vehicle revealed 5.6 grams of crack.  At his sentencing hearing Griffin claimed that the drugs found in the car actually belonged to his son and that he was only responsible for a few grams.


4
If as a matter of law the district judge could not believe Wilson's version of what occurred, Griffin wins.  But the district court had every right to credit Wilson's account, and if he is believed, it was proper to pin the drugs found in the car--again, 5.6 grams--on the father, who was the shorter, older man Wilson first observed doing what was obviously--and admittedly--a drug transaction.  That being the case, this appeal goes nowhere, and the district court's drug quantity finding as to Mr. Griffin cannot be viewed as clearly erroneous.


5
AFFIRMED.

 After an examination of the briefs and the record, we have concluded that oral argument is unnecessary.  Accordingly, the appeal

               . . . .

General     Appropriation      Act, Acts 1977, 65th Leg., ch. 872, at 2786.

       ln our opinion, the Compact provisions and section 25.07 provide preexisting
law which would support            an appropriation      to pay the cost of returning          a
nonadjudicated     runaway to Texas.       See Tex. Const. art. 3, § 44; Austin National
Bank v. Sheppard,       71 S.W.2d 242 (TX 1934); Attorney            General Opinion WW-340
(1957). However, we do not believe you are authorized              to pay these transportation
costs from the item for “[nlon-residential          services.”    Your budget request to the
65th Legislature     stated that the expenditure       for nonresidential     services would aid
the adjustment     of Texas Youth Council parolees.          Budget Estimates - Fiscal Years
1978 and 1979 at 101. Like the items for residential                 services     with which the
appropriation    groups the nonresidential      services item, it appears to be directed at
persons already under the supervision of TYC. -See Attorney General Opinion H-822
(1976). The TYC appropriation          specifically    authorizes    you to pay the costs of
deporting nonresident      patients or students and returning Texas patients or students
 from other states.      General Appropriations      Act, Acts 1977, 65th Leg., ch. 872, art.
II, 5 2e, at 2798. These provisions apply to persons under state supervision and not
to nonadjudicated     juveniles.   See Attorney General Opinion H-521 (1975).

        We find no indication       that the Legislature      intended   the nonresidential
services item to be used to pay the cost of returning nonadjudicated           runaways: all
indications    of legislative intent are to the contrary.     Since you have generally not
paid such costs, we cannot draw any inferences            from legislative   acquiesence    in
administrative     practice.  In our opinion, the proper course for South Carolina would
be to seek reimbursement        under the Miscellaneous     Claims Act. -See V.T.C.S. art.

In Reyes, the prosecutor told the jurors during closing argument that "we have to rely on the honesty, integrity and good memory of the officers" who engage in undercover drug operations. He also asked the jurors to consider what kind of motive the police officer witness for the state would have to lie and whether he appeared as though he was trying to deceive them. The court concluded that these comments did not amount to improper bolstering.
Smith also argues that a second comment by the prosecutor was improper because it appealed to the "conscience of the community." The prosecutor said:
Ladies and gentlemen, again I want to thank you for your attention in these proceedings. This is the first and last and only opportunity that I have to address you by way of closing remarks.
I ask when you are listening to the remarks of the lawyers for the defendants as they conclude their arguments, I just want to urge you to not let rhetoric or emotion get in the way of what you perceive as your duty as jurors. That is to collectively review, among yourselves the evidence that you've heard, decide whether or not in this caseyou are citizens that speak on behalf of your community and in order to be qualified as a juror to sit in this court you have to be a resident of the county where this crime occurred and where this crime is being tried. You are citizens that speak on behalf of your community in rendering a verdict in this case.
The courts have repeatedly condemned impassioned arguments which appeal to the jury's community sensibilities or civil conscience. Otero v. State, 754 So.2d 765 (Fla. 3d DCA 2000); Birren v. State, 750 So.2d 168 (Fla. 3d DCA 2000); Del Rio v. State, 732 So.2d 1100 (Fla. 3d DCA 1999); Williard v. State, 462 So.2d 102 (Fla. 2d DCA 1985); Carr v. State, 430 So.2d 978 (Fla. 3d DCA), cause dismissed, 436 So.2d 97 (Fla.1983). See also Thornton v. State, 767 So.2d 1286 (Fla. 5th DCA 2000) (arguments which beseech the jury to convict a defendant for any reason except guilt are highly prejudicial and strongly discouraged). Such arguments distract the jurors from their duty to reach a fair and just verdict based solely on the facts and evidence presented at trial. Birren.

3. Section 2 of the Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act provides as follows:
Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices, including but not limited to the use or employment of any deception, fraud, false pretense, false promise, misrepresentation or the concealment, suppression or omission of any material fact, with intent that others rely upon the concealment, suppression or omission of such material fact, or the use or employment of any practice described in Section 2 of the `Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act', approved August 5, 1965, in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful whether any person has in fact been misled, deceived or damaged thereby. In construing this section consideration shall be given to the interpretations of the Federal Trade Commission and the federal courts relating to Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act.
Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 121½, § 262 (1979).
4. In Rice v. Snarlin, Inc., 131 Ill.App.2d 434, 266 N.E.2d 183 (1970), the Illinois Appellate Court expressly stated that private enforcement of Section 2 of the Act is permissible. In a Northwestern Law Review article, Private Remedies, supra at 420-24, the Rice decision is discussed. The author of this article states that the Act does not expressly provide for a right of private enforcement and states that the Illinois Appellate Court in Rice found the existence of such a right by inquiring as to whether the Illinois General Assembly had intended to create such a right. Contrary to the conclusions of this law review author, this Court finds that the Act does expressly provide for private enforcement of Section 2 of the Act and such was also the finding of the court in Rice. Section 10a(a) of the Act states that "[a]ny person who suffers damage as a result of a violation of Sections 2 through 2N of this Act committed by any other person may bring an action against such person" (emphasis added).
5. In Evanston Motor Co. v. Mid-Southern Toyota Distributors, Inc., 436 F.Supp. 1370 (N.D.Ill.1977), the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois held that "an injury to the public, either directly (effect on consumers) or indirectly (effect on competition) must be alleged; the Act is not available to redress a purely private wrong." The court relied on the following sentence in Section 2 of

Whether an appellant is a "person aggrieved" is a question of fact for the district court.[7] The criterion is whether his "property may be diminished, his burdens increased or his rights detrimentally affected by the order sought to be reviewed."[8] The appellant must also have a "legal interest" in the challenged order to have a right to appeal.[9]
We think appellant satisfies these tests. As a compensation claimant who has *761 filed a proof of claim in the Chapter XI proceeding, Johnson has as direct a legal interest in the debtors' estate as does a bank or trade creditor who has similarly filed a proof of claim. In addition, his claim may be adversely affected by Judge Ryan's order authorizing the Agreement, since it will radically alter the debtors' capital structure.
Appellees also contend that Mr. Johnson is not a "party" within the meaning of Rule 802(a), because he did not appear in the proceedings resulting in Judge Ryan's order. The statute creating the right to appeal, however, does not require that a creditor appear in the proceeding but only that he be a "person aggrieved" by the challenged order.[10] We have already decided that Johnson satisfies this criterion as a claimant in the Chapter XI proceeding.
Although Rule 802(a) uses the term "party" rather than "person aggrieved" in defining the class entitled to appeal, appellees cite no authority which suggests that the Rule is intended to restrict the class of persons entitled to appeal beyond the standard set by statute. Our reading finds additional support in Rule 928, moreover, which provides that "[t]hese rules shall not be construed to extend or limit the jurisdiction of courts of bankruptcy over subject matter." (Emphasis added.)[11]
We hold that appellant has standing to appeal under the Bankruptcy Act and Rules. Accordingly, appellees' motion to dismiss the appeal is denied.
So ordered.

       During the plea proceeding, no inquiry was made of Appellant concerning the

facts necessary to substantiate the offense of indecency with a child by sexual contact

and no testimony from any other source was offered. Although the Judicial Confession

appears of record, it is never mentioned. Towards the conclusion of the multi-plea

proceeding, the trial court continued:


                                             6
          THE COURT:                    In Cause Number 5332 out of Carson County, I
                                        find there is sufficient evidence to find the
                                        Defendant, Michael Allen Chamberlain, guilty
                                        beyond a reasonable doubt of the second
                                        degree lesser-included offense of indecency
                                        with a child.


          Pursuant to the plea agreement announced, and based on nothing other than the

plea of guilty, the stipulation of evidence and the judicial confession, the trial court

suspended the imposition of sentence and placed Appellant on deferred adjudication

community supervision for a term of ten years.5 Adding further complication to the

already confusing plea agreement, the Order of Deferred Adjudication recites the

offense as ―indecency with a child, a lesser included offense than alleged in the

indictment,‖ pursuant to Penal Code ―section 22.11(a)(2),‖ a ―second degree felony.‖

Again, as stated above, 22.11(a)(2) is harassment in a correctional facility; whereas,

21.11(a)(2) is indecency with a child by exposure. Because the record of the plea

clearly reflects both the trial court and Appellant were discussing a plea to a second

degree felony, again we assume the difference between subsection (a)(2) and

subsection (a)(1) is nothing more than another example of a long line of scrivener‘s

errors.


          Forty days after being placed on deferred adjudication community supervision,

the State filed a motion to adjudicate. A hearing was held on January 14, 2014, and

AMENDED OPINION AND ORDER
AIKEN, District Judge.
Pursuant to defendant's Motion to Correct Clerical Mistakes, (doc. 25), the court issues the following amended order.
Claimant, Joyce R. Svatos, brings this action pursuant to the Social Security Act (the Act), 42 U.S.C. § 405(g), to obtain judicial review of a final decision of the Commissioner. The Commissioner denied plaintiff's application for disability insurance benefits (DIB). For the reasons set forth below, the Commissioner's decision is reversed.

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
Plaintiff first filed an application for disability and DIB on June 2, 1992, alleging disability since July 31, 1988, due to chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia. Tr. 12, 92-94, 103. The application was denied at the initial and reconsideration level. Tr. 96, 101, 102. Plaintiff filed another application for DIB on June 8, 1994, for the same alleged disability dating from July 31, 1988, due to chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, severe headaches, loss of memory and concentration, night sweats, and loss of sleep. Tr. 14, 124. The ALJ reopened the previous application for benefits *1115 for good cause. Tr. 12. Plaintiff's application was again denied, Tr. 139-142, as it was again upon reconsideration. Tr. 146-148. Plaintiff filed a timely request for a hearing. After the hearing, tr. 36-91, the Administrative Law Judge ("ALJ") determined that plaintiff was not disabled within the meaning of the Act. Tr. 12-19. 42 U.S.C. §§ 401-433. Plaintiff filed an appeal to the Appeals Council and submitted additional evidence that was entered into the record. Tr. 6. On March 23, 1998, the Appeals Council denied plaintiff's request for review, making the ALJ's decision the final agency decision. Tr. 4-5, 20 C.F.R. § 404.981. Plaintiff now seeks judicial review pursuant to section 205(g) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. § 405(g).

STANDARD OF REVIEW
This court must affirm the Secretary's decision if it is based on proper legal standards and the findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record. Hammock v. Bowen, 879 F.2d 498, 501 (9th Cir.1989). Substantial evidence is "more than

OPINION
ROBERT HOLMES BELL, Chief Judge.
This matter is before the Court on a motion for partial dismissal filed by Defendant S2 Yachts, doing business as Tiera Yachts. (Def.'s Mot. for Partial Dismissal, Docket # 6.) Plaintiff Kathryn M. Arredondo filed this lawsuit alleging that Defendant unlawfully retaliated against her *833 in violation of Section 503(a) of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a), and Section 602(a) of the Michigan Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights Act, Mich. Comp. Laws § 37.1602. Defendant seeks to have Plaintiffs claims under 42 U.S.C. § 12203 for compensatory and punitive damages dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Defendant contends that compensatory and punitive damages are not available for violations of § 12203. For the reasons that. follow, the Court grants Defendant's motion for partial dismissal.

I.
Rule 12(b)(6) tests whether a complaint "fail[s] to state a claim upon which relief can be granted." Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint may be dismissed only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations of the complaint. See Moon v. Harrison Piping Supply, 465 F.3d 719, 723 (6th Cir.2006); Pratt v. Ventas, Inc., 365 F.3d 514, 519 (6th Cir.2004). The court must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to plaintiff, accept all factual allegations as true, and determine whether

QUINN, Justice.
The People appeal from an order, entered after a preliminary hearing in the district court, dismissing a one-count information in which the defendant, Joel Keith Taylor, was charged with felony fraud by check, section 18-5-205, C.R.S.1973 (1978 Repl.Vol. 8 and 1982 Supp.).[1] The court ruled that there was no probable cause to believe that the defendant, when he issued the check, had the specific intent to defraud. We reverse the order of dismissal and remand for further proceedings.
The charge in this case arose out of the defendant's issuance of an "insufficient funds" check on September 14, 1981, in Buena Vista, Colorado. The prosecution's evidence at the preliminary hearing was uncontested and established the following facts. On September 14, 1981, the defendant purchased from Marvin Dauty, doing business as S & M Specialties Rent Shop, a chain saw for $759.86.[2] The defendant paid for the saw with his personal check drawn on the Bank of Breckenridge. Although the defendant had a checking account with the bank, the balance in the account was only $172.64 on September 11 and $159.47 on September 14, when the check in question was issued. The check was dishonored by the drawee bank and was returned to Dauty on September 30, 1981, with the notation "insufficient funds" on it. Dauty made numerous efforts to contact the defendant but was unable to do so. On October 7, 1981, Dauty received a letter which contained a $200 money order from the defendant. An enclosed note explained that the money should be credited toward the amount owed on the saw and that the *384 balance would be forthcoming. The balance, however, was not paid.[3]
At the conclusion of the preliminary hearing the court dismissed the information and discharged the defendant because, in its view, there was no probable cause to believe that the defendant issued the check with

On remand, the trial court must determine, as best it can under the  circumstances, how much green timber was improperly taken, when that green  timber would have been sold, and for what price. That sum must then be  compared with the amount received for the improperly harvested green timber  in the blowdown sale. Only in that manner will the Tribes receive the  "difference between the actual proceeds and the greatest appropriate  revenue which should have been obtained," Mitchell, 664 F.2d at 271, which  is the measure of damages applicable here.

32
Apart from the improper harvest of green timber, the Tribes contend that  they were not paid for a large amount of the damaged timber that was  harvested during the blowdown sale. That aspect of the Tribes' claim refers  to timber that the Tribes assert was properly removed under the contract  but not counted in the BIA records on which the payment to the Tribes was  based.


33
The Court of Federal Claims found that the Tribes had "raised some issues  and inconsistencies with regard to defendant's management and the  procedures it used to account for the Tribes' timber," but it declined to  award the Tribes any damages for the accounting irregularities because the  court found that the Tribes "did not prove a substantial amount of timber  was missing" and because the court concluded that it was unlikely that  significant numbers of logs would have been removed from the site  undetected. The court therefore concluded that there was insufficient  evidence "that logs were lost or stolen as a result of the BIA's handling  of the 1990 blowdown sale."


34
To the extent the court considered that the Tribes were required to prove  that "a substantial amount of timber was missing" before they could be  awarded damages, the court was mistaken. There is no threshold minimum of  loss that the Tribes were required to prove before being entitled to an  award. Even if the damages are minimal, the Tribes are entitled to recover  whatever damages they can prove.


35
The Tribes also contend that they should not bear the burden of proving  losses that cannot be established with certainty because of the BIA's  failure to keep adequate records of the timber that was removed during the  blowdown sale. Under trust law principles, if a trustee fails to keep  proper accounts, "all

BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs Shire U.S., Inc. and Shire Pharmaceuticals Ireland Limited (collectively, "Shire") seek a judgment that they do not infringe a patent assigned to Defendants Johnson Matthey, Inc., and/or Johnson Matthey PLC (Defendants collectively, "Johnson Matthey").[2] Both Plaintiffs and Defendants have their United States corporate headquarters in Wayne, Pennsylvania. The patent at issue, U.S. Patent No. 6,096,760, entitled "Solid Α phenyl-2-piperidine Acetate Free Base, Its Preparation and Use in Medicine," claims methylphenidate base and methods for its production and use ("the '760 patent"). Methylphenidate is a compound which can be used in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The base form of methylphenidate is applied to transdermal patches often used to treat children with ADHD. The '760 patent issued on August 1, 2000, to inventor Chester Sapino, and was assigned sometime thereafter to Johnson Matthey.
Shire is the exclusive licensee and global distributor of a product marketed under the trademark Daytrana. Daytrana is a pharmaceutical patch that delivers methylphenidate base transdermally. It is manufactured by Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Noven"), a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Miami, Florida.[3]
On June 19, 2007, Johnson Matthey filed a complaint against Noven in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, claiming that Noven infringed the '760 patent by manufacturing Daytrana ("the Texas Action").[4] Shire was not named as a defendant in the Texas Action at the time. Approximately one month later, on July 18, 2007, Shire instituted this action for declaratory judgment, seeking a ruling that it does not infringe the '760 patent by distributing Daytrana. Subsequently, on July 23, 2007, Johnson Matthey amended the complaint in the Texas Action to include Shire as a defendant on the basis of Shire's alleged infringement of the '760 patent through its distribution of Daytrana.[5]
Johnson Matthey moved to dismiss, or in the alternative, to transfer or stay this action on August 15, 2007. After reviewing the Motion, the response thereto, and the reply and sur-reply thereto, and hearing oral argument on the same, this matter is now ready for decision.

DISCUSSION

II.
The Authority next contends that the commission's award of $2.88 million for damages to the residue of the property was unsupported by the evidence and excessive as a matter of law, and that the trial court therefore erred in denying its post-trial motion to set aside that award. We agree.
Respondents' expert appraisers were prepared to testify at the valuation trial that the value of the residue was significantly diminished by the loss of access to Gun Club Road that would result from the construction of Highway E-470. One of the experts had assigned a pre-taking value of $8,230,000 and a post-taking value of $4,330,000 to the residue, resulting in damages of $3,900,000, with no amount awarded for special benefits. Respondents' second expert assessed total damages to the residue at $4,033,600, which represented the difference between a pre-taking value of $6,913,100 and a post-taking value of $2,948,400. The Authority's expert valued the residue at $2,517,000 before the taking, found that it had not been damaged but had benefitted in the amount of $281,000, and thus valued the residue after the taking at $2,798,000.
At the conclusion of a pretrial hearing on the Authority's motion to exclude evidence of access-related damages, the trial court ruled, in accordance with State Department of Highways v. Davis, 626 P.2d 661 (Colo.1981), that respondents had not shown that the highway project would substantially limit access to their property and, therefore, would not be permitted to present evidence of damages attributable to loss of access. It also instructed the commission that any damages arising from loss of access to Gun Club Road *803 were not compensable. These rulings have not been challenged on appeal.
After the trial court made its access ruling, the Authority asked the court to preclude respondents' experts from testifying because they were admittedly unable to segregate out from their damages figures the amount attributable to non-compensable access-related damages. The trial court ruled that the witnesses would be permitted to testify but that they could not "assign any compensation to . . . loss [of] access."
Consistent with the trial court's ruling, respondents' experts did not testify at the valuation trial to any post-taking value of the remainder. Further, when one expert testified that he considered loss of access as an important

PRENTICE, Justice.
Defendant (Appellant) was convicted in a trial by jury of murder in the first degree[1] in the slaying of his wife. His appeal presents two issues:
(1) Insufficiency of the evidence as to the requisites of purpose and premeditated malice.
(2) Incompetency of trial counsel.

ISSUE I
The evidence most favorable to the State, together with the inferences reasonably adduced therefrom, disclosed that the defendant and his wife had been having severe marital problems. Eight months prior to the slaying, the defendant stated that he would kill his wife if she ever left him, and approximately two weeks prior to the tragic event, he was seen by a neighbor striking his wife.
The defendant and his wife were living apart. The record is not clear as to whether or not she had commenced divorce proceedings, but it indicates that he at least believed that she had done so. Four days prior to the killing and while the decedent was momentarily absent, the defendant was observed sneaking around the mobile home where she resided with their children. On the same day, he visited the decedent at her mother's home and threatened to "get her." On the following day, he returned and made intimidating statements to her, saying that she would be "lying in the cemetery" and that when she left she had better be "looking over both shoulders."
On the day of the slaying, a neighbor, Sue Harris, went to the decedent's home to visit. To her surprise, the defendant answered the door with a shotgun in hand. The deceased was standing behind him and said. "Please don't hurt Sue. She's not done anything." The defendant motioned for Mrs. Harris to come in, but she turned to walk home; and as she did so, the defendant told her to call the law, which she did. A few minutes later, the children of the defendant and the decedent arrived at her door carrying a paper sack containing their night clothes, some toys and the defendant's wallet.
A deputy sheriff responded to Mrs. Harris' call approximately twenty-five minutes following her departure from the Kern home. As he arrived in his vehicle, he heard a gunshot from within the mobile home and another as he approached it on foot. He returned to his vehicle and radioed for assistance. Meanwhile, the defendant fled from the home, apparently through a rear window. He surrendered himself to the police on the following day.

WALTERS, Chief Judge.
Following trial by jury, Roger Ames was found guilty of assault with intent to commit a serious felony, I.C. § 18-909. He appeals, raising three issues. First, he contends his due process right to a fair trial was violated because the police failed to secure and preserve potentially exculpatory fingerprint evidence. Second, Ames argues his due process right was violated by placement of his prior arrest records in the court file as an attachment to an affidavit for the purpose of securing a warrant for his arrest. Third, he asserts the prosecuting attorney created reversible error by expressing his personal belief of Ames' guilt during closing argument to the jury. We affirm.
*486 Roger Ames was arrested for allegedly assaulting an elderly woman early one morning, with the intent to commit a sexual act and murder. The assault purportedly took place in the victim's home, an apartment leased from Ames' mother. The victim was acquainted with Ames and, in reporting the incident to the police, she identified Ames as her assailant. She testified at trial that Ames had held a knife to her throat and had threatened to kill her if she did not perform fellatio on him. She testified that when she resisted and refused to engage in the requested sexual act, Ames hit her twice on the head, threatened again to kill her if she called the police, and exited her apartment. The knife allegedly used by the assailant was left in the victim's apartment. Ames denied that he was the assailant, denied that he had ever assaulted the victim, and presented alibi evidence to show he could not have been the assailant at the victim's home at the time the incident was claimed to have occurred. The jury found Am

Talbert again argues for literal infringement, stating that the 345°F upper limit in the claims was included "only to confirm the gasoline's predominant C6-C10 composition and to establish cut ranges for the fuel's gasifier form." Talbert states that "[t]o interpret that temperature range as a restriction or requirement regarding the presence of all the low- or high-end components contradicts the reality of accepted refinery practice and renders the claim meaningless." Talbert points out that the specification recognizes and teaches that small amounts of hydrocarbons outside the claimed C6-C10 range may remain due to the imprecision of fractionation:


6
[The preferred intermediate range C6-C10 gasoline] ... can be made by removing the volatile and heavy components so that the remaining hydrocarbon mixture will boil within a range of about 121°F-345°F at one atmosphere. Such a boiling point range encompasses the boiling point of the lowest boiling C6 component and the highest boiling C10 component. Of course, it is possible that a small amount of C4, C5, C11 and C12 may remain after the separation process due to imperfections of gasoline fractionation procedures.


7
'356 patent, col. 7, lines 39-48. Thus Talbert argues that the 345°F limit is "nothing more than a recognition that the highest boiling C10 hydrocarbon (i.e., paraffinic decane) must be present in the claimed composition" and that the claims, correctly construed, do not exclude the presence of higher boilers in relatively small amounts.


8
In construing the claims, even accepting Talbert's view that gasoline fractionation does not readily achieve or require an exact endpoint, the prosecution history does not permit a claim scope that departs significantly from the stated temperature range. The temperature limit was placed in the claims at the examiner's insistence, to distinguish prior art that included a Hamilton reference that showed hydrocarbon fuels with an endpoint "within the range of about 390°F and about 420°F." Talbert had argued to the examiner that "the temperature range of the boiling points of the hydrocarbons of the gasoline of the presently claimed invention is between 96.8°F and 345°F." To gain allowance, Talbert was required to place the temperature restriction in the claims.

Talbert presented no reasonable explanation of how his designated endpoint of 345°F is correctly construed to include fuels with endpoints of 373°F and higher. We therefore affirm

                                         6
the arrest, but she agreed her perception would not have been as clear as a

trained police officer familiar with the area and where the stop sign and stop line

were located. During the hearing, Rhodes’s attorney said that he was attempting

to lay a proper predicate so that he could have two videos that Schloeman had

made of the intersection “admitted for purposes of suppression.”          But even

though Rhodes testified at the second hearing, her attorney never sought to

admit the videos into evidence for any other purpose than as part of her “offer of

proof.”

      In the third hearing related to Rhodes’s motion to suppress, Rhodes

ultimately supplemented her offer of proof with the two videos from Schloeman,

one purported to be of him driving by the intersection at night traveling at forty-

five miles per hour and a second one purported to be him driving by the

intersection at night traveling at thirty-five miles per hour.   The state did not

object to them being made a part of her offer of proof.

      The trial court entered findings of facts and conclusions of law. Among

other findings, the trial court found that Rhodes had “failed to come to a stop at or

behind the stop line” and that she had failed “to come to a complete stop and

nearly collide[d] with a vehicle that was traveling eastbound on [] Highway 377.”

In its conclusions of law, the trial court concluded that Walker “had reasonable

suspicion that [Rhodes] may [have been] intoxicated and therefore engaging in

the criminal activity of driving while intoxicated based upon [her] abnormal driving

behavior, the time of night, the location in relation to the drinking establishment,


                                         7
and the officer’s experience.” The trial court also concluded that Walker had

probable cause to believe Rhodes had committed a traffic violation. After her

plea, the jury’s assessment of punishment, and the trial court’s entry of judgment,

this appeal followed.

      In part of her first issue, Rhodes argues that the trial court erred by

2. Abandonment Not Shown

Appellant argues that the LaSalle requirements have not been met because the department has abandoned pursuit of a civil tax liability. Appellant contends that, contrary to the finding of the circuit court, the intelligence section's sole function is to collect information for criminal prosecution and therefore a subpoena issued by that section is solely for criminal prosecution.
[4]
The trial court's finding that involvement of the section does not indicate that the civil and criminal aspects of appellant's tax case have diverged, is one of mixed fact and law. To the extent the finding is factual, it will remain undisturbed because it is not contrary to the great weight and clear preponderance of the evidence. Cogswell v. Robertshaw Controls Co., 87 Wis.2d 243, 249-50, 274 N.W.2d 647, 650 (1979). To the extent that the finding is a conclusion of law, it is correct.
The duties of the intelligence section are not defined by statute or regulation. Indeed, we find no reference to that section in the statutes or regulations. Evidence as to its existence and how it operates was presented by appellant and the department.
The department's last biennial report to the governor and legislature which refers to the intelligence section covers a period ending June 30, 1971. That report states that the intelligence section investigates suspected violations of income, sales and excise tax laws and assists district attorneys in prosecuting violators. The evidence submitted by the department demonstrates, however, that the intelligence section is more concerned with civil liability determinations than the 1971 biennial report, taken alone, would indicate.
*88 The chief of the intelligence section testified that a special agent reports a summary of the facts of a case to the chief following an investigation of a matter referred to the section. The agent collects whatever evidence is needed to complete the investigation, including evidence which could be used in criminal prosecutions. The agent is not required to make a recommendation as to prosecution and in most cases none is made. The chief may recommend prosecution to his superior who, if he agrees, so recommends to the division administrator who may forward the matter to the prosecuting district attorney or to the attorney general. The special agent does not assist the prosecution. The section chief testified that approximately seventy tax cases were investigated in the year ending July 30, 1979, less than twenty-five percent of which were recommended for prosecution. Once the investigation has been completed, the intelligence section refers the matter to the audit bureau for

      The government appeals the district court’s order conditionally striking

portions of the indictment related to an alleged conspiracy by members and

associates of the Mara Salvatrucha (“MS-13”) gang to murder Los Angeles Police

Department Detective Frank Flores. We reverse.

      1. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3731 over the government’s

interlocutory appeal of the district court’s pretrial order striking portions of the

indictment. Although the district court’s order is conditional, we have previously

found that § 3731 provides jurisdiction over conditional orders, such as those

suppressing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Hoffman, 794 F.2d 1429, 1431

n.2 (9th Cir. 1986). Because the jurisdictional scope of § 3731 was broadly

intended to encompass “virtually all adverse rulings in criminal cases,” we may

properly hear this appeal. H.R. Rep. No. 107-685, at 165 (2002) (Conf. Rep.).

upon qualified immunity in a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 civil rights action

filed by Katheryn Hill on behalf of her deceased son, Robert

Wayne Hill.   We have jurisdiction to determine, as a matter of

law, whether Wright and Boyd are entitled to qualified immunity,

after accepting all of Hill’s factual allegations as true, by

determining whether Hill has alleged the violation of a clearly

established constitutional right and, if so, whether the

defendants’ conduct was objectively reasonable under clearly

established law.   See Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U.S. 299, 313

(1996); Colston v. Barnhart, 130 F.3d 96, 98 (5th Cir. 1997),

cert. denied, 119 S. Ct. 618 (1998); Rankin v. Klevenhagen, 5

F.3d 103, 105 (5th Cir. 1993).

     In Wright’s case, we find that the appellee has alleged a

III.
Finally, Polk argues that he was entitled to use reasonable force to resist arrest. In support of his argument, he relies exclusively on United States v. Moore, 332 F.Supp. 919 (E.D.Va.1971). In Moore, the accused grabbed the arm of an officer who was in the process of arresting her husband for simple assault. The court held that she was not criminally liable for this conduct, and emphasized that the arrest appeared unlawful to the wife because she did not know the difference between an "arrest" and an "apprehension" under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Id. at 921. In Moore, the court also emphasized the fact that unnecessary force was used in effecting the husband's arrest. Id. at 920.
We believe that the Moore decision is inapplicable to the case at bar. First, although Polk argues that he was entitled to use reasonable force to resist arrest, he does not contest that he was lawfully arrested based upon the information given Shirilla by his dispatcher. Instead, he contends that since, contrary to the information received by Shirilla, his license was not suspended and there was no pending failure to appear charge, he was entitled to offer reasonable resistance. We disagree. An individual is not entitled to resist a lawful arrest. West Virginia v. Jarvis, 310 S.E.2d 467, 470 (W.Va.1983); see Wright v. Bailey, 544 F.2d 737, 739-40 (4th Cir.1976). Further, Polk does not argue, and the record does not show, any use of unnecessary or unreasonable force by the officers making the arrest. Therefore, we *774 reject Polk's argument that he was entitled to use reasonable force under the authority of Moore.
In summary, we find that words alone may constitute an offense under Code § 18.2-460(A) when the words are threats knowingly made in an attempt to intimidate or impede law enforcement officers who are performing their duties; that the evidence was sufficient to demonstrate Polk's criminal intent; and that Polk cannot avoid criminal liability for his actions under the authority of Moore. Accordingly, we affirm his conviction.
Affirmed.

   Defendant Copeland maintains that the district court erred in deny-
ing his motion to sever his trial based on his need for co-defendant
Pops Davis to testify on his behalf. The grant or denial of a motion
to sever is reviewed for abuse of discretion. United States v. West,
877 F.2d 281, 287-88 (4th Cir. 1989). The basic rule is that persons
who have been indicted together, particularly for conspiracy, should
be tried together. United States v. Brooks, 957 F.2d 1138, 1145 (4th
Cir. 1992).

   When a defendant bases his severance motion on a purported need
for a co-defendant’s testimony, "the moving defendant must establish
(1) a bona fide need for the testimony of his co-defendant, (2) the
likelihood that the co-defendant would testify at a second trial and
waive his Fifth Amendment privilege, (3) the substance of his co-
defendant’s testimony, and (4) the exculpatory nature and effect of
such testimony." United States v. Parodi, 703 F.2d 768, 779 (4th Cir.
1983). However, when a co-defendant’s offer to testify is conditioned
on being tried first, the moving defendant has not established the like-
lihood that his co-defendant will testify. Parodi, 703 F.2d at 779.

   In this case, Copeland informed the court that he intended to call
his co-defendant, Pops Davis, to refute testimony by Mrs. Carter that
she sent Pops a bag containing money from Copeland to purchase
drugs. After Mrs. Carter’s testimony, the court engaged in an exten-
sive discussion with counsel on whether severance of Copeland’s trial
was warranted. At this point, Pops stated that he was willing to waive
his Fifth Amendment privilege and testify on Copeland’s behalf.
However, the court deferred ruling on the severance motion until it
heard the remainder of the government’s case-in-chief at which time
the court would have more information about the potential exculpa-
tory value of Pops’ testimony.

Taylor's Amended Complaint contains a total of twenty-one (21) counts. (Document Nos. 20, pp. 20-25, ¶¶ 73-97, 20-2, pp. 1-23, ¶¶ 98-229). The Defendants seek the dismissal of all but three counts. (Document No. 21, p. 2). Counts IV, VIII and XII allege violations of the IDEA, the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA against the District. (Document No. 20-2, pp. 6-7, 10-11, 14-15, ¶¶ 116-120, 143-149, 171-177). Those counts are not challenged in the Motion to Dismiss and, hence, will not be addressed in this memorandum opinion.
A. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Claims[1]
Counts I, II and III of the Amended Complaint assert IDEA claims against Adams, Myers and Ritchey, respectively. (Document Nos. 20, pp. 20-25, ¶¶ 73-97, 20-2, pp. 1-6, ¶¶ 98-115). Also relevant to the IDEA analysis is Count XIII, which *549 alleges violations of the IDEA, the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA and seeks redress against all of the Defendants under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. (Document No. 20-2, pp. 15-16, ¶¶ 178-182). Thus, Taylor's Amended Complaint contains claims against Adams, Myers and Ritchey both directly under the IDEA and under § 1983 for alleged violations of the IDEA. In their first Motion to Dismiss, the Defendants asked the Court to dismiss all claims against these three individuals to the extent that they were sued in their personal capacities. (Document No. 8, pp. 3-4, ¶¶ 2-10). The Court declined to do so for two reasons. First of all, there was an intervening clarification of the applicable law concerning the evaluation of a qualified immunity defense raised against a vaguely worded complaint. Taylor I, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70853, at *55-63. Consequently, the Court directed the parties to proceed in accordance with the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Thomas v. Independence Township, 463 F.3d 285 (3d Cir.2006). Id. The Court also noted that the Defendants had not advanced specific arguments as to whether Adams, Myers and Ritchey could

MR. JUSTICE RUTLEDGE, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE MURPHY join, dissenting.
Even upon the narrow view to which a majority of this Court adhere concerning the scope of the right to counsel *733 in criminal cases, as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment

         Subdivision 37.007(a)(3) requires mandatory expulsion for the conduct specified in subparts
37.006(a)(2)(C) or (D), p rovided the conduct described is a felony. Some of the acts listed in
subparts (C) and (D) are felonies, and some are misdemeanors. The issue, however, is whether, by
referring to section 37.006, subdivision 37.007(a)(3) incorporates activities occurring within 300 feet
of school property. It clearly does not, for two reasons. First, subdivision 37.007(a)(3) refers to
conduct rather than to geographical location. “Conduct,” in the referenced context, refers to a
“manner of conducting oneself or one’s life; behaviour.” III OXFORDENGLISHDICTIONARY690 (2d
ed. 1989). The “conduct” referred to consists of, on the one hand, selling, giving, or delivering to
another person, or possessing or using, marihuana or other such substances; and on the other, selling,
giving, or delivering to another person an alcoholic beverage, committing a serious offense under
the influence of alcohol, or possessing, using, or being under the influence of an alcoholic beverage.
Such conduct does not encompass the location where that conduct occurs.

         Secondly, and most significantly, subdivision 37.007(a)(3) is apart of, and is circumscribed
by, subsection 37.007(a). Subsection 37.007(a) limits mandatory expulsion to acts occurring “on
school property or while attending a school-sponsored or school-related activity on or off of school
property.” It does not comprehend acts that occur merely “within 300 feet of school property.”
Thus, we answer your question in the negative. A school district is not required to expel a student
whose conduct (1) constitutes a felony; (2) would require removal under subparts 37.006(a)(2)(C)
or (D); (3) does not occur on school property or while attending a school-sponsored or school-related
activity on or off of school property; and (4) does occur within 300 feet of school property as defined
in subdivision 37.006(a)(2).

        We note that section 37.019 of the Education Code may provide a means of expulsion in


Mootness

4
In affirming the district court's earlier denial of a preliminary injunction, we limited our decision narrowly, holding only that the court's finding of no irreparable harm to plaintiff from denying the injunction was not clearly erroneous.  471 F.2d 811 (3d Cir. 1973).  At that time, however, we noted that the question of mootness would have to be examined at a later point in these proceedings.  Id. at 812.  As originally drawn, plaintiff's complaint focused on the 1972 presidential election and sought to prevent corporate expenditures from influencing that election.  That election is now history.  Nonetheless, plaintiff alleges that defendants intend to make similar expenditures in future elections, and defendants, far from denying this, hotly defend their right to do so.


5
Controversies concerning elections often have presented mootness problems.  See e.g., Hall v. Beals, 396 U.S. 45, 90 S.Ct. 200, 24 L.Ed.2d 214 (1969); Moore v. Ogilvie, 394 U.S. 814, 89 S.Ct. 1493, 23 L.Ed.2d 1 (1969).  These problems arise since election controversies almost always are spawned shortly before the election, seek prospective relief directed to the election, and reach appellate courts only after the election.  Where the basis of such a controversy remains after an election and where the dispute is likely to recur, the case will not be found moot, even where prospective relief alone is sought.  Moore v. Ogilvie, supra, 394 U.S. at 816, 89 S.Ct. 1493.  When this case was before us on appeal of the preliminary injunction denial, the complaint asserted pendent federal jurisdiction over a claim arising under state law; although the complaint was ambiguous, it apparently sought injunctive relief for defendants' alleged violation of federal law and, on behalf of the corporation, damages for the claimed state law violation.  Our concern with mootness arose in this context.


6
Were plaintiff's federal claim pressed solely to secure injunctive relief, we would be required to determine whether plaintiff's bare allegation of defendants' intention to make future similar expenditures would support review, given no showing of a consistent pattern of such conduct and no assurance of plaintiff's continued ownership of Bethlehem stock.  After proceedings resumed in the district court, however, the plaintiff amended his complaint and now clearly

PER CURIAM:

              Lance      Adam     Goldman     seeks     to    appeal       the    district

court’s order dismissing as untimely his 28 U.S.C. § 2254 (2006)

petition.      The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice

or    judge   issues       a    certificate      of   appealability.             28    U.S.C.

§ 2253(c)(1)(A) (2006).             A certificate of appealability will not

issue     absent      “a       substantial    showing        of    the   denial        of   a

constitutional right.”             28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2) (2006).                 When the

district court denies relief on the merits, a prisoner satisfies

this    standard      by    demonstrating        that   reasonable       jurists        would

find that the district court’s assessment of the constitutional

claims is debatable or wrong.                Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473,

484    (2000);     see     Miller-El    v.    Cockrell,      537    U.S.    322,       336-38

(2003).       When the district court denies relief on procedural

grounds, the prisoner must demonstrate both that the dispositive

procedural ruling is debatable, and that the petition states a

debatable claim of the denial

                           ____________

PER CURIAM.

       Stephen Newport brought suit against Brian Payton and the City of Bettendorf
pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss based in part on
qualified immunity. The district court denied the motion and also denied defendants’
subsequent motion for reconsideration based on qualified immunity. Defendants
appeal the denial of qualified immunity, arguing solely that because the district court
failed to rule on Payton’s qualified immunity defense, this court should reverse and
remand with instructions for the district court to thoroughly rule on the issue.
Newport counters that the district court had no duty to thoroughly analyze qualified
immunity on a motion to dismiss, and contends this court lacks jurisdiction over the
premature appeal.

       Having jurisdiction over this appeal, see Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 673
(2009); Hager v. Arkansas Dep’t of Health, 735 F.3d 1009, 1012, 1014 (8th Cir.
2013), and upon careful review of the record, we conclude that it is apparent the
district court, in denying the motion to dismiss and motion for reconsideration,
applied the relevant federal pleading standards and concluded that Newport
sufficiently alleged plausible claims for violations of his constitutional rights, and that
such rights were clearly established, see Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 673 (discussing standards
for denial of motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity); Kulkay v. Roy, 847
F.3d 637, 642 (8th Cir. 2017) (same). Because defendants offer no argument on
appeal as to why Payton was entitled to qualified immunity on the face of the
complaint, we decline to consider the merits of the district court’s ruling sua sponte.

A. The Decision of the New York Court of Appeals


29
The New York Court of Appeals accepted certification of both questions on September 12, 2000. Hamilton v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 95 N.Y.2d 878 (2000) (mem.). On April 26, 2001, that Court handed down a unanimous decision "answer[ing] both questions in the negative." Hamilton III, 96 N.Y.S.2d at 230, 727 N.Y.S.2d at 11.


30
It began by emphasizing that the foreseeability of harm, standing alone, does not define the duty of care but "merely determines the scope of the duty once it is determined to exist." Id., 96 N.Y.2d at 232, 750 N.E.2d at 1060, 727 N.Y.S.2d at 12. Contrary to the district court's reasoning, the Court of Appeals found that defendants' relationships with their dealers and distributors did not "place[] the defendant[s] in the best position to protect against the risk of harm," given the "very large" pool of potential plaintiffs and the "remote" connection between defendants, the criminal wrongdoers, and plaintiffs. Id., 96 N.Y.S.2d at 232, 727 N.Y.S.2d at 12. The Court distinguished the products liability cases cited by plaintiffs on the rationale that those suits involved products that failed to include adequate safety features or warnings, unlike the present suit where "defendants' products are concededly not defective" and "if anything,... work too well." Id., 96 N.Y.S.2d at 235, 727 N.Y.S.2d at 15.


31
The Court further noted plaintiffs' argument "that a general duty of care arises out of the gun manufacturers' ability to reduce the risk of illegal gun trafficking through control of the marketing and distribution of their products." Id., 96 N.Y.2d at 235 750 N.E.2d at 1063. Given the lack of evidence of "any statistically significant relationship between particular classes of dealers and crime guns," however, it reasoned that imposition of such a general duty of care would create large, indeterminate classes of plaintiffs and defendants "whose liability might have little relationship to the benefits of controlling illegal guns." Id., 96 N.Y.S.2d at 235, 750 N.E.

Before WIENER, DeMOSS, and DENNIS, Circuit Judges.

PER CURIAM:*

     Joseph R. Rogers, Louisiana prisoner #105914, appeals from

the district court’s dismissal of his civil-rights lawsuit filed

pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.   The district court dismissed his

complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(i), (ii), and

(iii), because it held that his complaint lacked an arguable

basis in law or fact, failed to state a claim upon which relief

could be granted, and sought damages against defendants who were

absolutely immune.


     *
        Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined
that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent
except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR.
R. 47.5.4.
                             No. 00-31390
                                  -2-

     Rogers alleged that his constitutional rights were violated

due to the revocation of his parole and the refusals of his

requests for a revocation rehearing.    The Louisiana Department of

Public Safety and Corrections is absolutely immune from suit due

to the Eleventh Amendment.    See Champagne v. Jefferson Parish

Sheriff’s Office, 188 F.3d 312, 313 (5th Cir. 1999).     Members of

the Louisiana Board of Parole are absolutely immune from suit

when performing adjudicative functions.     See Walter v. Torres,

917 F.2d 1379, 1380 (5th Cir. 1990).    Because all of the

defendants named in Rogers’ complaint are absolutely immune from

suit, his complaint was properly dismissed under 28 U.S.C.

§ 1915(e)(2)(B)(iii).

     Furthermore, his claim challenging the revocation of his

parole is barred under Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 486-87

(1994).

17
Hill, 766 F.2d at 858 (emphasis added).


18
The district court did enter findings of fact with respect to sentencing some five months after Edwards filed his notice of appeal.  The government contends that these findings fulfill the requirement of Rule 32(c)(3)(D),7 while Edwards argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction to enter them because of the filing of his notice of appeal.  We agree with Edwards.


19
The effective filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional significance.   Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58, 103 S.Ct. 400, 402, 74 L.Ed.2d 225 (1982) (per curiam);  see Doyle v. United States, 721 F.2d 1195, 1197 (9th Cir.1983).  "[I]t confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal."   Griggs, 459 U.S. at 58, 103 S.Ct. at 402.  Thus, findings of fact may ordinarily not be modified while an appeal is pending concerning them.   Barber v. United States, 711 F.2d 128, 130 (9th Cir.1983);  see Flynt Distributing Co. v. Harvey, 734 F.2d 1389, 1395 n. 3 (9th Cir.1984).


20
While the rule divesting the district courts of jurisdiction upon the filing of a notice of appeal is not absolute, there are sound reasons for applying it here.  Rule 32(c)(3)(D) clearly contemplates that the determinations regarding disputed factual material will be made prior to sentencing.  The court must either resolve the factual dispute or determine that no such finding is necessary "because the matter controverted will not be taken into account in sentencing."    Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(3)(D) (emphasis added).  The defendant is not only entitled to know whether the disputed matter has affected his sentencing;  he is entitled to a sentence that is imposed in light of either a resolution of the disputed issues or a clear election by the sentencing judge not to consider them.  Failing such compliance with Rule 32(c)(3)(D), the defendant has the opportunity for a meritorious appeal and a right to resent

the district court abused its discretion by denying her motion for new trial because she lacked actual

notice of the trial setting. She contends that the appointment of counsel only thirty-one days before

the trial setting denied her right to counsel under the federal constitution and the state statute.


Denial of motion for new trial

                We review the denial of a motion for new trial for an abuse of discretion. Strackbein

v. Prewitt, 671 S.W.2d 37, 38 (Tex. 1984). The denial must be based upon guiding rules and

principles. Craddock v. Sunshine Bus Lines, Inc., 133 S.W.2d 124, 126 (Tex. 1939). A defendant

who has appeared in a cause is entitled to notice of the trial setting; a defendant who does not receive

notice of trial is deprived of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States



                                                   4
Constitution. LBL Oil Co. v. International Power Servs., Inc., 777 S.W.2d 390, 390-91 (Tex. 1989).

A party denied due process by lack of notice of a trial setting can get a new trial only by showing that

the failure to appear was not intentional or the result of conscious indifference, but was due to a

mistake or an accident. See Craddock, 133 S.W.2d at 126 (listing three factors in overcoming default

judgment); Mosser v. Plano Three Venture, 893 S.W.2d 8, 12-13 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1994, no writ)

(defendants deprived of notice need only satisfy first Craddock factor to merit new trial); Green v.

McAdams, 857 S.W.2d 816, 819 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1993, no writ). That party is

entitled to have the default judgment set aside. See LBL Oil, 777 S.W.2d at 390-91.

                Appellant denied that she knew that her trial was set for April 2001. She showed an

understanding of the importance of court settings by appearing at every pretrial hearing. She said she

did not receive the notice of trial setting sent in December 2000. She undisputedly did not sign the

order in March 2001 that contained the trial

32
(2) a breach of that duty;


33
(3) a legally cognizable causal relationship between the breach and the harm suffered (proximate cause);  and


34
(4) damages.


35
Absent proof of damages, proof of a breach of duty by the defendant does not prove negligence.  Peroti v. Williams, 258 Md. 663, 669, 267 A.2d 114 (1970);  MacCubbin v. Wallace, 42 Md.App. 325, 328, 400 A.2d 461, cert. denied, 285 Md. 732 (1979).  This is exactly the situation at bar.  Contrary to Amoco's assertions, there was ample proof in the record to support a finding that Amoco breached its duty to see that its storage tanks did not contaminate the local groundwater.  What is missing from Exxon's claim is proof of damages.  Exxon has failed entirely in proving that it suffered any damages as a result of Amoco's breach.  Thus, Exxon has failed to prove negligence.  On Amoco's motion, the lower court should have entered j.n.o.v. in its favor on the negligence claim.

V.

36
In sum, we hold that the trial court properly excluded all evidence of Exxon's permit damages because they were not proximately caused by Amoco's pollution and that any error in the property damage instruction has been rendered harmless or waived.  Because Exxon failed to prove that it suffered any damages as a result of Amoco's breach of duty, we remand this case for entry of j.n.o.v. in favor of Amoco on the negligence claim.


37

GUIDUGLI, Judge.
The Commonwealth of Kentucky has appealed from the June 25, 2002, Opinion and Order of the Jefferson Circuit Court granting Jodie Charles Bowles's (hereinafter Bowles) motion to reconsider and voiding his 1993 convictions for illegal possession of a controlled substance (cocaine) and illegal possession of a controlled substance (marijuana).[1] We affirm in part, vacate in part and remand.
In 1993, Bowles, along with co-defendant John Edward Young, was indicted by the grand jury on charges of Illegal Possession of a Controlled Substance, First Degree (cocaine),[2] Illegal Possession of a Controlled Substance (marijuana),[3] Illegal Use or Possession of Drug Paraphernalia,[4] and Carrying a Concealed Deadly Weapon.[5] Based upon the Commonwealth's offer, Bowles moved to enter a guilty plea, which the trial court accepted and entered on May 12, 1993. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the trial court adjudged Bowles guilty of illegal possession of cocaine, marijuana and drug paraphernalia and dismissed the carrying a concealed deadly weapon charge. On June 30, 1993, the trial court entered its final judgment of conviction and sentence, and ordered him to serve one year for illegal possession of cocaine and twelve months on each of the two remaining charges, which were to be served concurrently for a total of one year. The trial court withheld rendition of the judgment and placed Bowles on probation for five years, subject to his compliance with several conditions, including participation in a drug treatment program.
On November 8, 2001, Bowles moved the trial court to set aside and void his convictions pursuant to KRS 218A.275(9) and KRS 218A.276(8) as all terms of his probation and parole had ended on June 25, 1998, and as he had satisfactorily completed treatment, probation, payment of fees, and had complied with all orders of the *914 trial court. The Commonwealth objected, and the trial court denied the motion by an opinion and order entered March 22, 2002, reasoning that Bowles had not provided sufficient evidence that he had satisfied the drug treatment requirement. The trial court went on to state that even if Bowles had provided this evidence, his felony conviction for possession of cocaine would not fall under the parameters of KRS 218A.275(9) because the statute references only misdemeanor convictions pursuant to KRS 218A

¶ 1 This case concerns a summary judgment granted to defendant McDonald's Restaurants of Oklahoma, Inc., on a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress filed by former employee, Camran Durham. Plaintiff Durham alleged that his supervising manager denied three requests to take prescription anti-seizure medication and called plaintiff a "f. . .ing retard" in the course of denying the last request. Plaintiff related that he was sixteen at the time and the manager's refusals caused him to fear he would suffer a seizure. He stated he left work crying and did not return. These events allegedly occurred on June 1, 2006.
¶ 2 McDonald's did not controvert plaintiff's account of this incident on summary judgment. Instead, McDonald's argued that the manager's conduct was not "extreme and outrageous" conduct required for a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. McDonald's relied on an earlier federal court disposition of claims made by plaintiff under the Americans with Disabilities Act. In denying plaintiff recovery on the ADA claims, the federal court determined that the manager's conduct was "not severe."
¶ 3 The trial court concluded that the federal court disposition constituted an adverse preclusive determination of the "extreme and outrageous" element of plaintiff's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The Court of Civil Appeals agreed and affirmed. For the reasons that follow, we disagree, vacate the Court of Civil Appeals opinion and reverse the summary judgment.

I.
¶ 4 In order to prove the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress or outrage, a plaintiff must prove each of the following elements: 1) the alleged tortfeasor acted intentionally or recklessly; 2) the alleged tortfeasor's conduct was extreme and outrageous; 3) the conduct caused the plaintiff emotional distress; and 4) the emotional distress was severe. Computer Publications, Inc. v. Welton, 2002 OK 50, ¶ 7, 49 P.3d 732, 735. In the case at hand, McDonald's has argued that the federal court adjudicated the second and fourth elements of the tort, and, therefore, Plaintiff's claim is barred by issue preclusion.
¶ 5 Issue preclusion prevents relitigation of facts and issues actually litigated and necessarily determined in an earlier proceeding between the same parties or their privies. Nealis v. Baird, 1999 OK 98, ¶ 51, 996 P.2d 438, 458. Under the doctrine, once a court has decided an issue of fact or of law

The search conducted here was not incidental to a lawful arrest since there was no arrest. Nor was the search justified under the plain view or consent doctrines. Neither was this a search within the "stop and frisk" concept of Terry v. Ohio, supra, since there was no reasonable cause to believe that defendant was armed. The State did not show by a preponderance of the evidence that the officers had a reasonable belief that defendant was armed. United States v. Jeffers, 342 U.S. 48, 72 S.Ct. 93, 96 L.Ed. 59 (1951). See also, Annotation under R. 3:5-7 and cases cited thereunder. The officer's "suspicion" that the duffel bag contained a weapon because defendant was nervous did not amount to reasonable cause to believe so. Compare State v. Kennedy, 134 N.J. Super. 454 (App. Div. 1975). Further, to invoke the Terry concept the officer would first have to "pat down" the duffel bag and if, in doing so, he felt an object that could be a weapon, he would then have had probable cause to believe there was a weapon in the bag and conduct a full blown search. See also, Sibron v. New York, 392 U.S. 40, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 20 L.Ed.2d 917 (1968). None of those circumstances existed here.
*489 There remains the possible exception of existence of "exigent circumstances." The exception is applicable when the search is necessary to prevent disappearance of the suspect or destruction of the object of the search, to search for weapons to protect the safety of an officer or, because of the mobility of a motor vehicle, to prevent its flight. See, e.g., State v. Hannah, 125 N.J. Super. 290, 294-295 (App. Div. 1973); State v. Smith, 129 N.J. Super. 430 (App. Div. 1974), certif. den. 66 N.J. 327 (1974).
Since defendant was in police headquarters in the presence of several officers there could be no reasonable apprehension that defendant or his bag would disappear. If the officers had had a reasonable apprehension that their safety was involved, all they had to do was to take possession of the bag. They then could get the required search warrant. Certainly defendant's comment of "Oh, no," when one officer picked up the bag, cannot reasonably be construed as creating

Steven Arthur Richmond was convicted by a jury of three counts of transporting stolen vehicles in interstate commerce (18 U.S.C. Sec. 2312).  Richmond appeals his conviction.  His counsel has filed a brief in accordance with Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), raising two issues but indicating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal.  Richmond has filed a supplemental pro se brief.*   The government has moved for summary affirmance of the conviction.


2
Briefly, Richmond's counsel presented the questions of whether the trial court erred in failing to grant a directed verdict on the ground of entrapment and in permitting the government to reopen its case to show predisposition after the defendant testified.  These issues have no merit because there was evidence of predisposition and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the government to reopen its case to show predisposition.   United States v. Porter, 394 F.2d 508 (5th Cir.1968);  see also United States v. Schurn, 849 F.2d 1090 (8th Cir.1988);  United States v. Carter, 569 F.2d 801 (4th Cir.1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 973 (1978).


3
Richmond argues that deleted portions of the tapes played for the jury contained exculpatory information which was withheld by the government, but does not specify what the information might be.  The argument is meritless.  Richmond and his attorney had access to the tapes in their entirety, and certain incriminating portions were initially excised at his attorney's request.  Richmond's other arguments--that the witnesses against him were prejudiced, that his prosecution was political, and that the agency involved was duplicitous--are similarly without merit.


4
In accordance with the requirements of Anders, supra, we have examined the entire record in this case and find no other meritorious issues for appeal.  We accordingly affirm the judgment of conviction.  We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately developed in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.

v.
DISTRICT COUNCIL NO. 21, BROTHERHOOD OF PAINTERS, DECORATORS, AND PAPERHANGERS OF AMERICA (BPDP), An Unincorporated Association.
No. 30371.
United States District Court E. D. Pennsylvania.
November 27, 1962.
Joseph D. Guilfoyle, Acting Asst. Atty. Gen. and Drew J. T. O'Keefe, U. S. Atty., for appellant.
Meranze, Katz & Spear, Joseph B. Meranze, Philadelphia, Pa., for defendant.
LUONGO, District Judge.
This is an action brought by the Secretary of Labor under § 402(b) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 [29 U.S.C.A. § 482 (b)], hereinafter LMRDA, to set aside an election for Secretary-Treasurer held by defendant, District Council No. 21, on June 24, 1961. Defendant Union, relying on the Seventh Amendment and Rule 38, has demanded a jury trial. Plaintiff has moved to strike this demand.
Title IV of the LMRDA [29 U.S.C.A. Subchapter V] deals with election of union officers, and § 401 [29 U.S.C.A. § 481] contains the minimum procedural requirements which unions must follow *254 in electing officers. Failure to comply with these requirements gives a union member the right to challenge an election under procedures outlined in § 402 [29 U.S.C.A. § 482]. That section authorizes a union member, after first exhausting union remedies, to file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor alleging violations of § 401 [29 U.S.C.A. § 481]. Once a complaint has been filed the duty to investigate and institute judicial proceedings vests in the Secretary of Labor.
Subsections 402(b) and (c) [29 U.S.C.A. § 482(b) and (c)] provide:
"(b) The Secretary shall investigate such complaint and, if he finds probable cause to believe that a violation of this title has occurred and has not been remedied, he shall, within sixty days after the filing of such complaint, bring a civil action against the

v.
BLACKFEATHER.
No. 671.
Supreme Court of United States.
Argued and submitted October 18, 1894.
Decided November 19, 1894.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General Dodge for the United States, submitted on his brief.
Mr. Charles A. Maxwell and Mr. George S. Chase for the Cherokee Nation, appellant, submitted on their brief.
Mr. Charles Brownell for Blackfeather, appellee.
MR. JUSTICE BREWER delivered the opinion of the court.
This case is similar to that just decided in which the same parties were appellants, and Charles Journeycake, Principal *219 Chief, etc., defendant. The petition was filed under the authority of the same act of October 1, 1890, c. 1249, 26 Stat. 636, and to enforce the claim of the Shawnee Indians domiciled in the Cherokee Nation to an equal interest in the Cherokee reservation and outlet, and the proceeds and profits thereof.
In pursuance of article XV of the treaty of July 19, 1866, 14 Stat. 799, 803, an agreement was, on June 7, 1869, entered into between the Shawnees and the Cherokee Nation, through their representatives, the substantial portions of which are as follows:
"Whereas the Shawnee tribe of Indians are civilized and friendly with the Cherokees and adjacent tribes, and desire to settle within the Cherokee country on unoccupied lands east of 96°: It is, therefore, agreed by the parties hereto that such settlement may be made upon the following terms and conditions, viz.: That the sum of five thousand dollars belonging to the Shawnee tribe of Indians and arising under the provisions of treaties between the United States and the said Shawnee Indians as follows, viz., for permanent annuity for educational purposes, per fourth article of treaty 3d of August, 1795, and third article treaty 10th of May, 1854, one thousand dollars; for interest at five per cent on forty thousand dollars for educational purposes, per third article of treaty 10th of May, 1854, two thousand dollars; for permanent annuity in specie for educational purposes, per fourth article of treaty 29th of September, 1817, and third article 10th of May, 1854, two thousand dollars, shall be paid annually to the Cherokee Nation of said Indians, and that the annuities and interests as recited and

(6) enhance the quality of renewable resources and approach the maximum attainable recycling of depletable resources. 42 U.S.C. Sec. 4331 (emphasis added.)


14
The statute further requires (42 U.S.C. Sec. 4332) that all agencies of the federal government shall


15
(C) include in every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, a detailed statement by the responsible official on-


16
(i) the environmental impact of the proposed action,


17
(ii) any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented,


18
(iii) alternatives to the proposed action,(iv) the relationship between local short-term uses of man's environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity, and


19
(v) any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources which would be involved in the proposed action should it be implemented.


20
The statement thus prescribed is to be made available to the President, the Council on Environmental Quality, and the public.  This statute does not limit the authority of any governmental agency in any permanent or conclusive manner.  It does, however, contain a mandate that action can be taken only following complete awareness on the part of the actor of the environmental consequences of his action and following his having taken the steps required by the Act.  It is undeniable that the Act compels the Department to comply with its provisions when action is being taken having to do with a depletable resource.  Here also there is evidence of "new and expanding technological advances" directly related to the need for an application of this resource.


21
It is undisputed that the Secretary has not considered the environmental impact and has not taken any steps to fulfill the requirements of the NEPA.  Indeed the Secretary has not even followed the regulations of his own Interior Department purporting to implement the statute.  The NEPA also establishes a Council (in 42 U.S.C. Sec. 4344).  In order to carry out the mandate of the statute the Council must be apprised of agency actions having environmental consequences.  It does not appear from the statute that the agency action must await any responsive comments from the Council.  Instead, the apparent purpose of the Council is to review federal programs and activities so as to keep the President informed on the extent to which these activities

2
 In the present case, the district court's oral findings of fact, based on uncontroverted evidence, amply illustrate abuses contemplated by Quiller and Sprouse.    The district court found:
Here we have a situation where the lender has gone somewhat further than a situation where it has merely attempted [as in Quiller ] to utilize contractual provisions which are contrary to the statute and regulations.  We have a situation where the lender through its operatives has gone beyond the contract and demanded immediate possession and taken action by telephone to repossess and to foreclose.
The district court found that Citicorp's agents engaged in a "definite pattern" of threatening repossession and foreclosure with no prior notice whatsoever.  During the course of telephone conversations with debtors, Glenda Burris, a collection agent, would call out to coworkers to "put some axles on the truck" indicating that, at her direction, a truck was departing at that moment to foreclose on the debtor's mobile home.  In several instances debtors were told that their personal belongings would be taken along with their homes.  Several debtors fled their homes after these calls.  None of these debtors received the federally required thirty days written notice of foreclosure.
Unlike Sprouse and Quiller, which addressed the hypothetical abuse of contract provisions inconsistent with consumer protection legislation, the instant case presents actual abuse of contract provisions whose ambiguities are exploited by creditors in a manner directly contrary to federal regulations.

 O.C.G.A. Sec. 11-9-503 (1982), Georgia's codification of U.C.C. Sec. 9-503, provides in part:
Unless otherwise agreed a secured party has on default the right to take possession of the collateral.
The majority contends that the contract provision setting U.C.C. required notice at five days does not apply to Sec. 9-503 foreclosure notice because Sec. 9-503 permits, but does not require, notice prior to foreclosure.
I do not share the majority's narrow reading of Sec. 9-503.  A fair application of that section here is:  where parties agree that thirty days notice will precede foreclosure, then that notice is a prerequisite

Before WILLIAMSON, C. J., and WEBBER, BELIVEAU, TAPLEY and SULLIVAN, JJ.
WEBBER, Justice.
Plaintiffs brought this petition for declaratory judgment naming 48 defendants and seeking a determination as to whether certain building restrictions affect the use of plaintiffs' property or should be removed as a cloud upon their title. Those defendants who resist the action first filed an answer. They then moved to strike their answer and filed a demurrer. The motion and demurrer were overruled. Exceptions were allowed and forthwith prosecuted in the Law Court.
The issues presented here are basically procedural. They furnish a rather lucid illustration of the interesting results which sometimes flow from the formidable complexities and the demanding formalities of common law pleading. The issues are twofold. Are these exceptions prematurely before us? Is the nature of the case presented by this petition such as to dictate procedure as at law or as in equity? The procedure to be followed in a petition for declaratory judgment is governed by the "`nature of the case'". Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. City of Portland, 144 Me. 250, 68 A.2d 12, 17. The plaintiffs contend that the case is equitable in its nature. The defendants insist that law procedure should govern. The defendants have used the demurrer and exceptions, as they frankly admit, as a means of ascertaining at the very outset what their procedural vehicle should be to transport them over the long road of litigation. Their choice of a method of ascertainment appears remarkably efficacious, for the present state of the pleadings presents an interesting paradox. If this cause is equitable in its nature, "ordinarily exceptions will not be entertained in the Law Court before a case in equity comes up for a final hearing." Munsey v. Groves, 151 Me. 200, 202, 117 A.2d 64, 66. If that rule is applicable here, these exceptions to the overruling of the demurrer are prematurely before us and must be dismissed. If we dismiss them for that reason, however, we thereby determine that the cause is equitable, and thus indirectly give the defendants an answer to their question. On

EX PARTE LANCE ALAN LISTER, Applicant




ON APPLICATION FOR A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
CAUSE NO. C-34,391 IN THE 244TH DISTRICT COURT
FROM ECTOR COUNTY



           Per curiam.
 
O R D E R

            Pursuant to the provisions of Article 11.07 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, the
clerk of the trial court transmitted to this Court this application for writ of habeas corpus.  Ex parte
Young, 418 S.W.2d 824, 826 (Tex. Crim. App. 1967).  Applicant was indicted for burglary of a
habitation. He pleaded guilty and was convicted of theft. He later pleaded true to a motion to revoke
community supervision and was sentenced to two  years’ imprisonment in a state jail facility.  The
Eleventh Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction. Lister v. State, No. 11-09-00251-CR (Tex.
App.–Eastland Jan. 7, 2010) (unpublished). 
            Applicant raises several grounds of review. He contends, inter alia, that his trial counsel
rendered ineffective assistance because counsel did not investigate the facts of the case and allowed
applicant to plead guilty to a state jail felony when the actual value of stolen goods was insufficient
to support a state jail felony charge. The habeas record contains no response from the State and no
findings and conclusions from the trial judge. 
            Applicant has alleged facts that, if true, might entitle him to relief.  Strickland v. Washington,

From the record before us, what a trustee, if appointed, could or could not accomplish, is rather speculative.  What is not speculative or in any wise conjectural is this:  the Plan clearly and unequivocally states that if FDIC was not paid in full by March 1, 1994, a trustee would be appointed immediately on motion of an interested party.4  That command is to us quite clear, and, such being the case, the parties should be held to the Plan. 11 U.S.C. §§ 1141, 1142.  The district court erred in affirming the bankruptcy court's denial of the motion to appoint a trustee.  It follows that the district court's affirmance of the bankruptcy court's final decree discharging the Debtors and "closing" the case should also be reversed.  Finally, since a trustee is now to be appointed, the district court's affirmance of the bankruptcy court's order authorizing a compromise and settlement of the Spitz' tax liability to the State of Oklahoma was, in a sense, premature.  The denial of ARF's motion to appoint a trustee by the bankruptcy court and the approval of the compromise agreement between Spitz and the Oklahoma Tax Commission by the bankruptcy court are to us related matters.  The result of the trustee's activities could conceivably have an impact on the bankruptcy court's resolution of Spitz' request to approve its compromise with the Oklahoma Tax Commission or, indeed, have an effect on the desire of either Spitz or the Oklahoma Tax Commission to compromise.5


11
The order of the district court is reversed in its entirety, and the case is remanded to the district court with direction that it vacate the bankruptcy court's three orders and that it direct the bankruptcy court to appoint a trustee as mandated by the Plan.



*
 This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.  The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments;  nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.  R. 36.3

 Counsel states in his brief that the only reason Spitz filed Chapter 11 proceedings was that FDIC insisted on immediate payment of Spitz' total indebtedness to the insolvent bank and FDIC's unwillingness to accept deferred payments under an orderly liquidation plan extending over a definite period of time

C. THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RESTORATION ACT OF 1993 DOES NOT PRECLUDE THE NTIA'S DETERMINATION OF INELIGIBILITY.
Apart from challenges to NTIA's own regulations and underlying statute, Fordham also argues that the Government's prohibition of federal funding of telecommunication equipment for sectarian programming is in violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, Public Law 103-141, 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb. In making this claim for the protection of free exercise of religion, the Plaintiff bases this argument on the Act's requirement that the government demonstrate a compelling interest where a law substantially burdens one's exercise of religion:
§ 2000bb-1. Free exercise of religion protected
(a) In general
Government shall not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section.
(b) Exception
Government may substantially burden a person's exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person 
(1) is in the furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and
(2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.
(c) Judicial relief
A person whose religious exercise has been burdened in violation of this section may assert that violation or defense in a *697 judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government....
42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1.
However, the Defendant properly points to two reasons why these provisions are inapplicable here. First, the challenged regulations do not burden anyone's free exercise of religion, much less "substantially burden." In no way is a failure to subsidize a "burden"; WFUV can, and does, broadcast Mass as it always has.[6] Second, the NTIA's attempt to comply with the Establishment Clause does constitute a compelling interest. See Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 102 S.Ct. 269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981). The Court finds it curious that Plaintiff attempts to rely on Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963) in advancing this argument. In that case, the Supreme Court ruled for a Seventh Day Adventist who had lost her eligibility for state unemployment compensation due to

United Paperworkers Int'l Union v. MISCO, Inc., 484 U.S. 29, 108 S.Ct. 364, 370 (1987) (quoting Steelworkers v. Enterprise Wheel & Car Corp., 363 U.S. 593, 596-97 (1960)).  The Supreme Court further stated:  "as long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority, that a court is convinced he committed serious error does not suffice to overturn his decision."    MISCO, 108 S.Ct. at 371.


9
Given the words "most senior qualified employee" in the collective bargaining agreement, the award represents a plausible interpretation of the contract.    George Day, 722 F.2d at 1477.  Certainly, the arbitrator was "arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority," which is all the Supreme Court requires to affirm the award.    MISCO, 108 S.Ct. at 371.  The parties are bound by the award even if it results "from a misinterpretation of law, faulty legal reasoning or erroneous legal conclusions."    George Day, 722 F.2d at 1479.


10
Contrary to Columbia's suggestion, there are no cases from the Supreme Court or this circuit holding that an arbitrator must consider evidence of past practices when the language of the collective bargaining agreement is clear and unambiguous.  Rather, both courts stress their limited role in reviewing an arbitrator's decision.  Thus, the result is mandated by our narrow standard of review.  The decision of the district court must stand because the arbitrator has not manifested a disregard for the law.    See San Martine Compania de Nav. v. Saguenay Terminals Ltd., 293 F.2d 796, 801 (9th Cir.1961) (a "manifest disregard of the law" occurs where an arbitrator understands and correctly states the law, but nonetheless proceeds to disregard it).  In the absence of explicit Supreme Court law or an explicit, well-defined and dominant public policy that evidence of past practice is always admissible in the labor context, the arbitrator made a reasonable choice to consider only the clear language of the agreement.  The arbitrator did not dispense his own brand of industrial justice where there was ample authority to support his decision.


11
The district court did not err in granting summary judgment for the union.

19
This reading is supported by consideration of the passage  that immediately precedes the sentence quoted by MSHA. The statutory timetable, the Committee said,


20
eliminates the possibility of the lengthy standard promulgating procedures, which have too often been experienced under the current Coal and Metal Acts, by putting a closure date on the several steps of the process.  Once the standard promulgation procedure begins, it is regulated within a specific statutory time frame.  This procedure should facilitate more expeditious promulgation of standards.


21
Id.  The Report thus makes clear that Congress did intend  the ninety-day rule to "put[ ] a closure date" on the rulemaking process.  Id.


22
We also reject MSHA's claim that its breach of the deadline is excused by additional rulemaking requirements that  Congress has imposed on agencies since the Mine Act was  passed in 1977, including the Regulatory Flexibility Act of  1980 (as amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996), and the Paperwork Reduction  Act of 1980.  See 5 U.S.C. §§ 601-612;  44 U.S.C. §§ 35013520.  Despite the increased requirements this legislation  imposes on the agency, nothing in either of these general purpose statutes indicates a congressional intention to set  aside the specific timetables of the Mine Act (or any other  statute).  Nor are we persuaded by MSHA's complaint that a  1993 executive order "makes compliance with Section 101(a)'s  timetables virtually impossible," by requiring agencies to  submit their rules for up to ninety days of pre-publication  review by the Office of Management and Budget.  MSHA Br.  at 17 n.7;  see Exec. Order No. 12,866,  6(b)(2)(B), 58 Fed. Reg. 51,735, 51,742 (Sept. 30, 1993).  Needless to say, the  President is without authority to set aside congressional  legislation by executive order, and the 1993 executive order  does not purport to do so.


23
We conclude that Congress meant what it said.  In the  words of the Senate Report, "[w]ithin 90 days of the certification of the hearing record (or of the close of the comment  period if no hearing is required), the Secretary is required

[¶ 1] This is the second appeal by the State of North Dakota from an order of the district court dismissing the criminal information filed against Father Leonard Wayne Burckhard. We affirm.

I
[¶ 2] As reported in State v. Burckhard, 1998 ND 121, 579 N.W.2d 194 [Burckhard I], this case arises from a criminal information charging Father Burckhard, a parish priest for St. Catherine's Church in Valley City, with theft of property, a violation of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-23-02(1) and Class B felony under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-23-05(1). The State alleged Burckhard "knowingly took and exercised unauthorized control over money in excess of $100,000.00 belonging" to the church. Burckhard subsequently filed a N.D.R.Crim.P. 12(b) motion to dismiss the complaint, arguing the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. To support his jurisdictional argument, Burckhard submitted a letter written by James Sullivan, the Catholic Bishop of the Fargo Diocese, to his attorney. Bishop Sullivan's letter generally described the Roman Catholic Church's Code of Canon Laws, ecclesiastical tribunals, and hierarchical structure. The district court interpreted Bishop Sullivan's letter to say that determination of the scope of a parish priest's authority to expend church funds would require ecclesiastical interpretation of the Canon Laws. The district court reasoned exercise of jurisdiction would involve excessive entanglement by the courts into church affairs in violation of our state and federal constitutions, and therefore dismissed the complaint. The State appealed.
[¶ 3] This Court's decision produced three opinions. Justice Sandstrom, joined by Justice Neumann, concluded Bishop Sullivan's letter "[did] not support Burckhard's claim he had absolute or unlimited authority to expend church funds," and urged remand for a trial on the merits. Burckhard I, 1998 ND 121 ¶¶ 35, 39, 579 N.W.2d 194.

Larry Shavers appeals a judgment entered on a verdict that found him guilty of conspiracy to rob a bank, armed bank robbery, using a firearm in the commission of an armed bank robbery, kidnapping, and using a firearm in the course of the kidnapping.  The district court imposed maximum, consecutive prison sentences on all counts.  Shavers' numerous assignments of error concerning the admission and sufficiency of evidence need no discussion, for clearly they do not warrant reversal.  His assignment of error pertaining to the reason the court imposed maximum sentences requires that the judgment be vacated and the case be remanded for resentencing.  Other complaints about the sentences are ill founded.

* During his allocution, Shavers told the court that he was going to appeal.  Shavers' counsel asked the court not to impose a greater sentence than 30 years.  He pointed out that this was the sentence imposed on Shavers' brother, his partner in crime, who had pled guilty.  This colloquy followed:

4
THE COURT:  (interposing) Well, let me ask you this, ...:  If the court imposes light sentences in this and the defendant should prevail on appeal, then on retrial he would be limited to the amount of sentence imposed at this time?    Isn't that correct?

PROSECUTOR:  That is correct, your honor.

THE COURT:  And so he would be in effect moving the punishment down by having a modest sentence in this case;  wouldn't he?

PROSECUTOR:  That is correct, your honor.

THE COURT:  And he wouldn't have anything to lose by doing that?    He would get a light sentence at this end and then have his chances on appeal.  If he prevailed on appeal, he would have really beat the system;  wouldn't he?

OPINION
KEETON, District Judge.

I.
The complaint in this case alleges a claim for copyright infringement. Defendants assert, among other defenses, that any cause of action that may have existed was assigned to defendant Lotus Development Corporation in an Asset Purchase Agreement of June 7, 1985 between plaintiff, as seller, and Lotus as buyer. Jurisdiction in this court depends upon whether plaintiff has asserted a claim arising under the Copyright Act.
Case law holds that federal jurisdiction should be declined by the court where a claim purportedly arising under the Copyright Act is essentially for a declaration of ownership or contractual rights. See Topolos v. Caldewey, 698 F.2d 991 (9th Cir. 1983); Stepdesign, Inc. v. Research Media, Inc., 442 F.Supp. 32 (S.D.N.Y.1977). It is nevertheless permissible in appropriate circumstances for a federal court to exercise pendent jurisdiction over state law claims where the complaint states a valid federal law claim. United Mine Workers of America v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 86 S.Ct. 1130

On December 15, 1965, defendant appeared with Mr. Joseph Noskay of the Public Defender's Office, who stated that defendant was represented by Mr. Lester Watson but, without further explanation, that he was "standing in his stead." The State then recommended "ten years on the 18th of October," (obviously meaning "from"), having already recommended concurrent sentences of ten years each at the time the pleas of guilty were made. The Court imposed a sentence of ten years in each case, "to run concurrently," but granted probation for the purpose of treatment at a federal hospital, with the probation to be continued for four years after such treatment. On March 7, 1966, defendant filed a motion to vacate the judgment and sentence, which was denied on March 8, 1966, without a hearing. We need not note the grounds of that motion, for no appeal was taken and it was supplanted by a later motion filed on July 19, 1966, from the denial of which the present appeal was taken. In that motion defendant alleged: that at the time of sentencing he was forced to proceed with Mr. Noskay in the absence of his own counsel, in violation of his right to counsel of his own choice; that he had not been properly served with notice of the Court's order on his former motion and that such order was made ex parte and without notice. This motion was supplemented by one filed on September 20, 1966 (entitled "Motion to Vacate Unlawful Judgment and SentenceWithdraw Guilty Plea"), in which defendant also sought to question the legality of his arrest and of a search, alleged that his pleas were not voluntary, and that he did not have a "fair and speedy trial"; he also reasserted the fact that his own attorney was not present at the sentencing, and that he did not "request, want or need" Mr. Noskay.
On September 21, 1966, his motion to vacate was denied; in the context of this case the ruling clearly applied to both pending motions. At that time defendant's request for leave to proceed in forma pauperis was granted and counsel was appointed, obviously for the purposes of an appeal. The original notice of appeal was filed late, but we granted leave to file a delayed notice of appeal *73 under Rule 28.07, V.A.M.R., which was done. The appeal has been briefed and argued here by counsel and we proceed to consider the questions thus raised. The convictions in these two cases were so

       Robert Rice appeals his jury conviction for knowing possession of child

pornography, and knowing receipt and distribution of child pornography.            For the

following reasons, we will affirm.

                                             I.

       Because we write exclusively for the parties, we set forth only those facts necessary

to our disposition. Rice, who was an officer in the United States Army, had a laptop

computer. Without his knowledge, his wife, Marilyn Rice-Goldie, installed a spyware

program called “Spector Pro” on the laptop. Spector Pro—the presence of which was not

readily apparent to computer users—monitored and reported on the activity of Rice’s entire

computer, including accounts on the laptop that Rice had not authorized Rice-Goldie to

access. Among other things, Spector Pro logs keystrokes, takes screen shots, captures web

sites visited, and saves the contents of searches, emails and chats.

       After installing Spector Pro, Rice-Goldie reviewed Spector Pro’s records and

discovered child pornography on the laptop. Rice-Goldie eventually turned the laptop over

to the police. Based on Rice-Goldie’s reports, the police obtained a search warrant and

found evidence of child pornography on the laptop.

       Rice was charged with one count of knowing possession of child pornography, in

violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5), and one count of knowing receipt and distribution

of child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(2). Before trial, Rice moved




                                              2
to suppress the evidence seized under the above warrants, arguing, inter alia, that it was

acquired in violation of the Wiretap Act.1 The District Court denied Rice’s motion.

        In May 2016, Rice was tried by jury. On the first day of trial, Rice-Goldie appeared

as a government witness. During defense counsel’s cross-examination of Rice-Goldie, the

prosecutor erroneously commented, in the jury’s presence, that defense

of that discretion.” State v. Soto, 855 N.W.2d 303, 307-08 (Minn. 2014) (quotation

omitted). A district court is not generally required to provide an explanation when it

considers reasons for departure but imposes a presumptive sentence. State v. Van Ruler,

378 N.W.2d 77, 80 (Minn. App. 1985). “Only the rare case will merit reversal based on



                                             9
the district court’s refusal to depart. When the record contains evidence of factors

supporting departure, which could have been, but were not, considered by the district court,

we may remand for consideration of those factors.” State v. Johnson, 831 N.W.2d 917,

925-26 (Minn. App. 2013) (emphasis added) (quotation omitted), review denied, (Minn.

Sept. 17, 2013).

       Appellant contends the district court failed to exercise its discretion by failing to

consider valid departure factors as the district court did in State v. Curtiss, 353 N.W.2d 262

(Minn. App. 1984). In Curtiss, the district court said only that there was “no justifiable

reason to deviate,” apparently precluding arguments for and against departure. 353

N.W.2d at 263. Here, the district court continued sentencing for the purpose of accepting

briefing on the very issues of departure and the applicability of mandatory minimums, and

to allow the district court time to read and research the arguments of counsel. We do not

assume that the district court intended to waste everyone’s time by continuing the

sentencing for briefing and then ignored both the briefs and the entire question of whether

a departure was appropriate.

       Alternatively, appellant contends the district court abused its discretion in denying

his motion for departure. Appellant contends there was evidence of factors supporting

departure before the district court; namely that appellant was “particularly amenable to

probation, as demonstrated by his acceptance of responsibility, his lack of any violent

criminal history, his relatively young age, and the state’s decision to extend an offer of a

probationary sentence before trial.” Appellant’s sentencing memorandum relied on the

Discharge
Each of the subsections of 11 U.S.C. § 727(a), which have been specifically cited in the plaintiffs' complaint will be addressed separately.
Subsection (a)(2) of 11 U.S.C. § 727 reads as follows:

*93 (a) The court shall grant the debtor a discharge, unless 
. . . .
(2) the debtor, with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor or an officer of the estate charged with custody of property under this title, has transferred, removed, destroyed, mutilated, or concealed, or has permitted to be transferred, removed, destroyed, mutilated, or concealed
(A) property of the debtor, within one year before the date of the filing of the petition; or
(B) property of the estate, after the date of the filing of the petition.
11 U.S.C. § 727(a)(2).
The key factor with respect to an allegation under subsection (2)(A), or under subsection (2)(B), is that the debtor must have engaged in the proscribed conduct and that the property involved was property of the debtor or property of the debtor's estate. M Corp. Management Solutions, Inc. v. Thurman (In re Thurman), 901 F.2d 839, 841 (10th Cir.1990); In re Srour, 138 B.R. 413 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1992). As this court previously said:
Although the debtor may have a derivative interest in his corporation's assets, the term "property of the debtor" as expressed in 11 U.S.C. § 727(a)(2)(A) has reference to property in which the debtor has a direct proprietary interest. M Corp. Management Solutions, Inc. v. Thurman (In re Thurman), 901 F.2d 839, 841 (10th Cir.1990) ("Congress intended to limit the reach of § 727(a)(2)(A) only to those transfers of property in which the debtor has a direct proprietary interest."); In re Wines, 114 B.R. 794, 796 (Bankr.S.D.Fla.1990).
It does not follow that because the debtor may have caused his corporation to transfer its assets in fraud of its creditors, it should also follow that the transfer of property of another entity should support a denial of

Valdhe F. Pitman, Oklahoma City, for plaintiff in error.
Mac Q. Williamson, Atty. Gen., Sam H. Lattimore, Asst. Atty. Gen., for defendant in error.
*721 BRETT, Presiding Judge.
Plaintiff in error, Jack Woods defendant below, was charged by information in the District Court of Jackson County, Oklahoma, with the crime of grand larceny (21 O.S. 1951 § 1704) after former conviction of a felony (21 O.S. 1951 §§ 51, 54). He was tried by a jury, convicted, and his punishment fixed at ten years in the state penitentiary. Judgment and sentence were entered accordingly, from which this appeal has been perfected.
The defendant presents three assignments of error, only one of which will be considered here. The information alleges that the defendant was convicted on March 8, 1940, in Marion County, Indiana, of the crime of Second Degree Burglary and Grand Larceny under the name of Jack Rudolph White, and further alleges the defendant was convicted on February 8, 1946, in Wabash County, Illinois, of the crime of Assault with Intent to Commit Robbery, under the name of Jack R. Woods. The record reveals that the County Attorney offered in evidence in support of these allegations a copy of the judgment and sentence in each case. Proof of this matter was sought to be made by handing to the Sheriff of Jackson County a group of papers which he denominated to consist of penitentiary commitments of Illinois and Indiana and certified copies from courts of these jurisdictions (the record does not disclose clearly of what these were copies). Objections to these documents were interposed and sustained by the trial judge. The record does not disclose upon what basis these objections were sustained. The only other proof offered in support of the allegations of prior convictions is to the effect that the defendant admitted to the Sheriff of Jackson County, without being advised of his constitutional rights that any admission he might make might be used against him, that he had sustained prior convictions in Indiana and Illinois, as hereinbefore described. This manner of proof does not meet the requirements of the law and the procedure heretofore outlined by this Court pertaining to the proof of such matters. In Tice v. State, Okl.Cr., 283 P.2d 872, 874, the manner of proof was outlined as follows:

20
....  The statute is specifically cast in the alternative:  that defendant embezzled an article in a package "entrusted to him or which comes into his possession intended to be conveyed by mail" (emphasis added).   Although the package with the dress may not have been intended to pass through defendant's hands in the course of its conveyance by mail, the evidence showed that it did come into his actual or constructive possession in his position as a postal employee.   He violated his position of trust as a postal employee with regard to the package.   This is sufficient to support his conviction under § 1709.


21
In my view, this is a correct construction of the statute that is factually supported by the trial record.   I would affirm.

 The statute states:
Whoever, being a Postal Service officer or employee, embezzles any letter, postal card, package, bag, or mail, or any article or thing contained therein entrusted to him or which comes into his possession intended to be conveyed by mail, or carried or delivered by any carrier, messenger, agent, or other person employed in any department of the Postal Service, or forwarded through or delivered from any post office or station thereof established by authority of the Postmaster General or of the Postal Service;  or steals, abstracts, or removes from any such letter, package, bag, or mail, or article or thing contained therein, shall be fined not more than $2,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.

 The indictment states:
On or about the 25th day of January, 1992, in the State and District of Minnesota, the defendant,
CALVIN A. SELWYN,
a Postal Service employee, did knowingly and willfully embezzle a package, or anything contained therein, which was entrusted to him or which came into his possession, and which was intended to be conveyed by mail, or forwarded through a post office or station thereof established by the authority of the Postal Service;  all in violation of 18 United States Code Section 1709.

 Many states have similarly enacted consolidated statutes.   See, e.g., Ark.Code Ann. § 5-36-102 (Michie 1987) ("Conduct denominated theft in this chapter constitutes a single offense embracing the separate offenses heretofore known as larceny, embezzlement, false pretense, extortion, blackmail, fraudulent conversion

      On December 4, Smith mailed IP a $10,000 check and a letter from
Hannibal National Bank that was supportive but not a firm loan commitment.
IP initially endorsed and deposited Smith's check.     However, on December
21, IP wrote Smith rejecting his "conditional" offer.      IP then returned
Smith's $10,000 and sold the lumberyard for a lower price to a buyer with
secure financing.    Smith sued, claiming breach of a contract to sell him
the lumberyard.


      To satisfy the Missouri statute of frauds, a writing must contain all
the essential terms of the contract and must be signed by the party to be
charged.    Several documents in combination may supply the essential terms
of the contract, "as long as one




                                     -2-
document refers to the other, or their contents clearly show they are
related."    Vess Beverages, Inc. v. Paddington Corp., 941 F.2d 651, 654 (8th
Cir. 1991).    Whether documents satisfy the statute of frauds is a question
of law.     Ahrens v. Dodd, 863 S.W.2d 611, 613 (Mo. App. 1992).


     We agree with the district court that Smith has not satisfied the
statute of frauds.      Smith first contends that the March 20 Agreement
satisfies the statute because the parties later simply modified its terms.
This fact-intensive theory was not pleaded or argued in the district court
and may not be raised initially on appeal.     See Dorothy J. v. Little Rock
Sch. Dist., 7 F.3d 729, 734 (8th Cir. 1993).    Moreover, contracts required
to be written under the statute of frauds may not be modified orally.    See
Warrenton Campus Shopping Ctr., Inc. v. Adolphus, 787 S.W.2d 852, 855 (Mo.
App. 1990).     Finally, the summary judgment record does not support this
modification theory -- the March 20 Agreement provides that it may only be
modified in writing, none of the later documents refer to that Agreement,
and Smith himself testified that the March 20 Agreement "just died" and
"went away."

combination, contain either an offer by IP to sell the

Dianna KEITH, Respondent.
No. 97-0871.
Supreme Court of Texas.
June 5, 1998.
*541 James V. Sylvester, Austin, for petitioner.
Linda L. Daniels, San Antonio, for respondent.
PER CURIAM.
In these cross-appeals, the court of appeals described this case as one in which it "explore[d] the outer boundaries of the bystander cause of action in Texas." 953 S.W.2d 365. Because the court of appeals exceeded those boundaries when it held that a cause of action may exist under the facts presented here, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and render judgment for United States Automobile Association (USAA).
The facts are not in dispute. Dianna Keith's daughter, Lyndsay Keith, was a passenger in a car that swerved out of control and hit a tree. The owner of the vehicle was uninsured or underinsured. The accident occurred approximately one block from the Keith residence where Dianna Keith was asleep at the time of the crash. Shortly after the accident, Adam Hahn, a friend of Lyndsay's who had been following the car in which she was a passenger, drove to the Keith residence and awoke Dianna Keith. From the summary judgment evidence, it appears that Hahn was in shock and was only able to tell her that his urgency had "something to do with Lyndsay." Hahn rushed Dianna Keith to the accident scene, where the wrecked car was still smoking and a tail-light was blinking. Keith could not see her daughter, but she could hear her inside the wreckage making "scary noises and crying out."
After Lyndsay was removed from the car, Dianna Keith accompanied her daughter in the ambulance to a location where a helicopter took Lyndsay to the hospital. Keith later arrived at the hospital and waited while her daughter was in the operating room. She was informed around 3:20 a.m. that Lyndsay had died.
Dianna Keith was insured by USAA. She presented claims under her uninsured/underinsured motorist policy as the representative of Lyndsay's estate, as a beneficiary under the Texas Wrongful Death Statute, and for her own injuries as a bystander. USAA settled the estate's claims for $20,000 but denied Dianna Keith's bystander recovery claim. Keith filed suit

February 4, 2004.
*654 Chanon Williams, Chicago, for Appellant.
Robert S. Rivkin, General Counsel, Chicago Transit Authority, Chicago (Thomas J. Bamonte, Ellen L. Partridge, Stephen L. Wood, of counsel), for Appellee.
Justice SOUTH delivered the opinion of the court:
Plaintiff, Grace Gaines, filed a negligence action against defendant, Chicago Transit Authority (CTA), to recover damages in the amount of $30,000 for personal injuries sustained when she suffered a fall while a passenger on one of its buses. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the CTA, and plaintiff has appealed, contending that the trial court erred in ruling as a matter of law that the CTA did not owe a duty of care to plaintiff and that the trial court based its decision on an erroneous standard of care.
The complaint alleged that the CTA, as a common carrier, owed a duty to exercise the highest practicable degree of care to its passengers, and that it was guilty of one or more of the following negligent acts or omissions: (1) operated its vehicle in a careless, reckless, and negligent manner; (2) negligently operated its vehicle at a speed greater than that allowed by statute or ordinance and greater than reasonable and proper under the circumstances; (3) negligently, carelessly and recklessly disregarded traffic signals; and (4) failed to maintain and exercise reasonable care to discover and prevent danger and injury to its passengers. The complaint further alleged that "as a direct and proximate result of the careless and negligent conduct of defendant as above set forth, plaintiff[,] while walking down the aisle of the carrier[,] was injured."
Plaintiff gave a discovery deposition in which she testified as follows: on October 11, 2000, she boarded a southbound bus on 55th and Cottage Grove Avenue in Chicago at approximately 4:30 p.m. She was the last passenger to board at that stop and entered behind several students who were carrying book bags. The students were standing in the front of the bus, which was *655

JUDGMENT

1
Having considered the record from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and the briefs and arguments of counsel, the court is satisfied that appropriate disposition of this case does not require a published opinion.   See D.C.CIR.R. 36(b).   It is


2
ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the district court's order filed November 15, 1994, be reversed.  29 C.F.R. § 1613.214(a)(4) provides that the 30-day time limit established by 29 C.F.R. § 1613.214(a)(1) shall be extended "when the complainant shows that he/she was not notified of the time limits and was not otherwise aware of them...."  In Bayer v. United States Dep't of Treasury, 956 F.2d 330 (D.C.Cir.1992), this court held that a plaintiff's sworn statement that he did not know of the 30-day requirement raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding the applicability of § 1613.214(a)(4) that precluded summary judgment.   Like the plaintiff in Bayer, the appellant has averred that she did not know that she had to contact an EEO counselor within 30 days.   Therefore, as in Bayer, summary disposition of this case was improper.


3
The government offers only one basis for distinguishing Bayer.   It claims that the fact that the appellant considered bringing suit earlier demonstrates that she knew of the 30-day requirement.   This court has already rejected that distinction as "unsound."  Bayer, 956 F.2d at 333.   As this court pointed out, a plaintiff's knowledge that a complaint could be lodged in no way compels the inference that the plaintiff knew that such a step was mandatory, much less that such a step had to be taken with 30 days.   Id.  Therefore, the appellant is entitled to prove that the agency did not notify her of the 30-day requirement either through a general distribution of information to employees, or by some other means, and that she was not otherwise aware of the 30-day requirement.


4
The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after the disposition of any timely petition for rehearing.   See D.

11
The Ninth Circuit has ruled that a defendant's good faith is one factor of several that a court may consider in applying the Attorney's Fees Act.  Aho v. Clark, 608 F.2d 365, 367 (9th Cir. 1979).  There are several reasons, however, for accepting the prevailing view1 that good faith by itself is not a special circumstance justifying a denial of attorney's fees.


12
First, accepting the defendant's good faith as a special circumstance tends to make the Attorneys Fees Act a superfluous legislative enactment.  The Senate Report on the Act states explicitly that the Act was prompted by the Supreme Court's holding in Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U.S. 240, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975), which undercut a "common law" judicial rule permitting plaintiffs to recover fees in public interest litigation.  S.Rep.No.94-1011, 94th Cong.2d Sess. 4-5, reprinted in (1976) U.S.Code Cong. & Ad.News 5908, 5911-11.  If it had been Congress' intent to permit attorney's fees only against defendants who acted in bad faith, the Act would have been unnecessary since even Alyeska allowed fees in that extraordinary circumstance.  See Alyeska, 421 U.S. at 258-59, 95 S.Ct. at 1622.


13
Second, accepting a defendant's good faith as a special circumstance ignores the standards Congress intended courts to follow in making awards.  The Senate Report states that "(i)t is intended that the standards for awarding fees be generally the same as under the fee provisions of the 1964 Civil Rights Act," and cites approvingly the Supreme Court's decision in Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 390 U.S. 400, 402, 88 S.Ct. 964, 966, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968) S.Rep.No.94-1011, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 4, reprinted in (1976) U.S.Code Cong. & Ad.News 5908, 5912.  Newman expressly rejected a defendant's good faith as a special circumstance with reference to the fee provisions of Title II of the Civil Rights Act.  390 U.S. at 402,

No. 55,527

Opinion filed February 18, 1984.

Fred Spigarelli & Timothy A. Short, of Spigarelli, McLane & Short, of Pittsburg, were on the brief amicus curiae for the Kansas Trial Lawyers Association.
The opinion of the court was delivered by
PRAGER, J.:
This is a workers' compensation appeal. The facts in the case are undisputed and are as follows: The claimant, Alice M. Ploutz, was employed as a wire cutter by respondent, Ell-Kan Company, Inc. She claimed a 100 percent permanent partial general disability based on a back injury arising from and aggravated by three separate accidents occurring March 29, 1977, September 12, 1977, and March 19, 1979. Claimant sought medical treatment after each injury and was hospitalized each time. Claimant returned to work after recuperating from the first two accidents. Likewise, she returned to work after the third accident in March 1979, but continued to miss work frequently because of back pains, until she finally quit her job in November 1979. Claimant is now working in a liquor store owned by her son. Her duties include some light lifting, but do not involve lifting anything heavier than a single case of beer.
After a hearing, the administrative law judge found claimant's injuries were caused by the three accidents, with all three arising out of and in the course of her employment. The administrative law judge determined that claimant suffered a 40 percent permanent partial general disability to the body as a result of the injuries and also concluded that, under the circumstances, the claimant would not be able to return to the same position of employment with Ell-Kan. Both claimant and the Workers' Compensation Fund appealed to the workers' compensation

PER CURIAM.
       Alicia Eaton, on behalf of herself and her two minor children, appeals the
district court’s1 dismissal of their civil-rights complaint for failure to state a claim.
After careful review, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion
in denying leave to amend the complaint, see Popoalii v. Corr. Med. Servs., 512 F.3d
488, 497 (8th Cir. 2008) (standard of review); and that dismissal was proper, see
Federer v. Gephardt, 363 F.3d 754, 757 (8th Cir. 2004) (Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)
dismissal is reviewed de novo). Accordingly, we affirm, see 8th Cir. R. 47B, except
that we modify the dismissal of any state-law claims to be without prejudice, see
Labickas v. Ark. State Univ., 78 F.3d 333, 334-35 (8th Cir. 1996) (per curiam).

FACTUAL SUMMARY
The facts of this case are undisputed. Mr. Woodland ("Debtor"), filed a petition for relief under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code and his proposed Chapter 13 plan on September 6, 2001. The Debtor's Schedule D listed the Bank of Mason as a secured creditor holding a security interest in the Debtor's 2000 GMC truck, valued by the Debtor at $15,025, with the Bank's claim listed as $22,000. The Chapter 13 plan provided payments of $475 per month, including interest at a rate of 9%, on the secured debt to the Bank. The Bank made no objection to confirmation of this proposed plan term and valuation, and the Chapter 13 plan was confirmed on November 21, 2001. The Bank subsequently filed two claims in the case, consisting of one for $15,025 secured by the vehicle and one for $11,697.31 designated as unsecured. Orders allowing these claims were entered. As a result of the combination of these pleadings, there is no denying that a valuation was made in the Chapter 13 case.
The Bank's secured claim, which included interest, was paid in full during the course of the Debtor's Chapter 13. Prior to completion of the Chapter 13 plan, however, on January 17, 2005, the Debtor voluntarily converted his case to Chapter 7. The Chapter 7 petition asserts an exemption in the vehicle for 100% of the current market value, which was scheduled as $11,425. An amendment to Schedule C reiterates the Debtor's claimed 100% exemption, with no amount stated in this amendment but asserting that the Bank's secured claim was paid in full during the Chapter 13 case.
The Debtor has filed a motion under § 722 to redeem the vehicle for $0, based on the undisputed fact that the Bank's allowed secured claim was paid in full through the Debtor's Chapter 13 plan. The Chapter 7 trustee objects to the Debtor's motion, contending that such a redemption would be effectively an "installment redemption" proscribed by the Sixth Circuit's ruling in General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Bell (In re Bell), 700 F.2d 1053 (6th Cir.1983), which declared that the sole method for redemption under § 722 is by a lump sum payment.
In addition, the trustee has filed a motion to compel turnover of the vehicle, alleging that the truck is property of the Chapter 7 bankruptcy estate under §§ 348 and 541. The Debtor again argues that the vehicle is exempt from the estate. The

Duane Montgomery, Appellant Pro Se.


Unpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.
PER CURIAM:

       Duane    Montgomery           appeals         the   district      court’s      orders

dismissing his civil action, denying his motions for entry of

default and default judgment, and denying his motion to alter or

amend    judgment.         We    have       reviewed       the   record      and    find    no

reversible error.           Accordingly, we grant leave to proceed in

forma pauperis and affirm for the reasons stated by the district

court.         Montgomery       v.     United         States,     No.    5:14-ct-03279-H

(E.D.N.C.      Mar.   7,   &    Mar.       31,       2016).      We   deny   Montgomery’s

motions for transcript at government expense.                           We dispense with

oral     argument     because        the    facts       and   legal     contentions        are

adequately      presented

determinations in the notices of deficiency.   Even so, counsel

for petitioners obtained copies of these reports and urge that

they support the reasonableness of the values reported on

petitioners' returns.   Not surprisingly, petitioners' counsel did

not call Carmagnola to testify in these cases, but preferred

instead to rely solely upon his preliminary ill-founded valuation

estimates.   (Carmagnola has not been called to testify in any of

the Plastics Recycling cases before us.)   The Carmagnola reports

were a part of the record considered by this Court and reviewed

by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in the Provizer

case, where we held the taxpayers negligent.   Consistent

therewith, we find in these cases, as we have found previously,

that the reports prepared by Carmagnola are unreliable and of no
                                - 45 -

consequence.     Petitioners are not relieved of the negligence

additions to tax based on the preliminary reports prepared by

Carmagnola.

     Petitioners also submitted several documents into the

records of their cases as evidence that they monitored their

investments.     Of those documents, just one concerned Poly

Reclamation and none concerned Clearwater.      The one that

concerned Poly Reclamation, dated September 30, 1982, indicated

that three of its Sentinel EPE recyclers had been placed and were

running.15    The remaining documents included two financial

statements for another Plastics Recycling partnership, Stevens

Recycling Associates (Stevens), for the years ended 1982, 1983,

and 1984; two reports regarding the placement of the Sentinel EPS

recyclers owned by Stevens; and an August 29, 1985, letter that

discussed "the impossible pricing situation that continues in the

polystyrene market."    On the subject of the progress reports,

Zimmer testified:    "To be honest with you, I didn't pay that much

attention to anything I got but I know that I got very infrequent

reports * * *.    It was minuscule."     We are not convinced from the

lone Poly Reclamation progress report that petitioners monitored

or took an active interest in their investments in the

Before addressing the merits of the First Amendment claim, we must determine whether the ordinance should be analyzed as a prior restraint — as advocated by Encore Videos — or as a time, place, and manner regulation. As a general rule, "a law subjecting the exercise of First Amendment freedoms to the prior restraint of a license, without narrow, objective, and definite standards to guide the licensing authority," is a presumptively unconstitutional "prior restraint." Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham, 394 U.S. 147, 150-51, 89 S.Ct. 935, 22 L.Ed.2d 162 (1969). Zoning regulations restricting the location of adult entertainment businesses are considered time, place, and manner regulations, however, if they do not ban such businesses throughout the whole of a jurisdiction and are "designed to combat the undesirable secondary effects of such businesses" rather than to restrict the content of their speech per se.1 Relevant harmful secondary effects of adult businesses include crime, reduction of economic activity, and lowered property values. Lakeland Lounge, 973 F.2d at 1257.


6
There is no evidence of improper censorial motives on the part of the city council. Where "nothing in the record ... suggests impermissible motives on the part" of the enacting legislature, a local government seeking to use the secondary effects justification need show only that "(1) the drafters of the ordinance did rely upon studies of secondary effects," and (2) a "majority" of the city council members received "some information about the secondary effects." Lakeland Lounge, 973 F.2d at 1259.


7
In an opinion rejecting a First Amendment challenge to Ordinance # 82135, the predecessor to Ordinance # 87443, we held that the city "relied on studies provided by the City Council relating to secondary effects." Natco, Inc. v. City of San Antonio, No. 98-50645, slip op. at 6, 1999 WL 423074 (5th Cir. June 2, 1999) (unpublished). In this circuit, unpublished opinions issued on or after January 1, 1996, generally are not binding precedent, although parties may cite them, and they have "persuasive value." 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4. Natco's factual findings on the exact point at issue surely carry "persuasive" weight. Id. They also have been endorsed by the district

I. The Enhancement
Section 12022.7, subdivision (d) provides: "Any person who personally inflicts great bodily injury on a child under the age of five years in the commission of a felony or attempted felony shall be punished by an additional and consecutive term of imprisonment in the state prison for four, five, or six years."
Under section 12022.95: "Any person convicted of a violation of Section 273a, who under circumstances or conditions likely to produce great bodily harm or death, willfully causes or permits any child to suffer, or inflicts thereon unjustifiable physical pain or injury that results in death, or having the care or custody of any child, under circumstances likely to produce great bodily harm or death, willfully causes or permits that child to be injured or harmed, and that injury or harm results in death, shall receive a four-year enhancement for each violation, in addition to the sentence provided for that conviction...."
While the four-year sentence imposed here on the section 12022.7 enhancement was the same length as a sentence under section 12022.95, the 12022.7 enhancement makes the underlying endangerment conviction a "violent" and serious felony under sections 667.5, subdivision (c) and 1192.7, subdivision (c)(8). Thus, in contrast to the situation that would have existed if section 12022.95 had been applied, defendant is eligible only for 15 percent, rather than 50 percent worktime credit (§§ 2933, subd. (a), 2933.1, subd. (a)), and can henceforth be charged with a prior "strike" under section 667, subdivision (d)(1).
The People contend that defendant is procedurally barred from arguing that the section 12022.7 enhancement could not be used in her case. The principal contention is that defendant was required to obtain a certificate of probable cause. (§ 1237.5; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 30(b).) Courts have split on the certificate issue when the validity of an enhancement admitted by the defendant has been challenged.
In People v. Loera (1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 992, 206 Cal.Rptr. 60 (Loera), decided by Division Four of this Appellate District, the defendant pleaded guilty to receiving stolen property, and admitted a section 12022.6 enhancement as to the value of the property. He argued on appeal that his sentence for receiving stolen property could not be enhanced under section 12022.

BACKGROUND
Appellant was charged with two counts of entering an inhabited dwelling with intent to commit larceny, in violation of Penal Code section 459 (all further unspecified code sections refer to the Penal Code). He pleaded no contest to a single count of larceny and was sentenced to a term of 24 months probation under standard conditions, including the requirement that he serve six months in the county jail and participate in a residential drug treatment program.
Seven months later, appellant's probation was revoked; and he subsequently admitted that he had violated the terms of his probation. After subjecting appellant to a 90-day diagnostic study pursuant to section 1203.03, the trial court sentenced appellant to the statutory maximum of three years in state prison, and suspended the sentence. The court reinstated appellant's probation with new conditions, including another eight months in the county jail and further residential drug treatment. To obtain this result, appellant was required to waive all credit for the time he had served, and would serve, in the treatment program and in county jail.
*240 At the sentencing hearing, appellant agreed to the terms of this sentence pursuant to People v. Johnson (1978) 82 Cal.App.3d 183, 147 Cal.Rptr. 55 (Johnson I). He thus expressly waived all credits for the time he had previously served in jail and all credits for the time he had spent in the residential treatment program. It is undisputed that the probation department's report calculated his total credit for time served in both venues to have totaled 392 days. At the sentencing hearing, defense counsel objected to the waiver of time-served credits and the court noted the preservation of the issue for appeal. Appellant's notice of appeal and petition for writ of habeas corpus contend that the court committed error by requiring appellant to "waive all previously accrued credits in order to have probation reinstated...."

DISCUSSION
The underlying facts pertaining to appellant's offense are immaterial to our discussion of the claimed sentencing error. Turning first to our examination of the record pursuant to People v. Wende, supra, 25 Cal.3d 436, 158 Cal.Rptr. 839, 600 P.2d 1071, we discern no issues requiring further briefing or discussion, other than those discussed below in connection with the alleged sentencing error. We consider the circumstances where a trial court can require waiver of statutorily mandated time-served credits when the result may be a sentence exceeding the maximum sentence provided by law. We also revisit the issue of whether a trial court is permitted

timely appeal followed.
                                FACTUAL BACKGROUND
       Khloe came to DCFS’s attention after she tested positive at birth for benzodiazepine.
Mother told the hospital staff she had failed to reunify with her five older children, all of
whom had been removed from her care, and that she had a history of mental illness. Four of
the children were in permanent plans in Texas. The fifth child, Mason B., had tested positive
for methamphetamine and cocaine at birth in September 2011 in California.3 Mother was
denied reunification services for Mason, parental rights were terminated and Mason’s
adoption was finalized in May 2013.
       Mother admitted using methamphetamine while pregnant with Khloe, but claimed to
have been clean for about 51 days. Before Khloe’s birth, mother resided at the Augustus
Hawkins Psychiatric Facility for 49 days. Before that, she resided at Safe Haven in Santa
Monica. Mother had been diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety disorders, for which she had
been prescribed Zoloft and Depakote. Mother denied being bipolar. She said she had
anxiety, for which she took medication and saw a therapist. Once discharged, mother
planned to reside with Khloe at the Sleep Tight

The Storr Defense
Storr claims that he procured and offered to sell the marijuana because his life was threatened and for no other reason. He originally met with Robert Duitch on November 13, 1969, to attempt to sell him a life insurance policy. During the course of their discussion, Duitch told Storr that he had agreed to sell 800 pounds of marijuana to a member of a Denver motorcycle gang but could not complete the transaction. He asked Storr to fabricate an excuse for him. Storr acceded to the request and offered an excuse, but then volunteered to sell them 200 pounds of marijuana. The so-called gang members, who, in fact, were detectives Newman and Taketa, accepted the new offer and accompanied Storr and Duitch to Duitch's home. Later that evening, Duitch went to Storr's home to inform him of the threats which had been made to him. Storr testified that Duitch was panic-stricken and said that unless the marijuana deal was finalized, the motorcycle gang would kill both of them.

II.

The Mojo Defense
Mojo's defense is similar to Storr's. He claims that he did not have the specific intent to possess and sell marijuana, because he acted only to prevent injury to his friend, Storr. After Storr learned of the threats on his life from Duitch, he contacted Mojo and recounted the events which related to the threats and the proposed marijuana transaction. Storr said that he needed to procure the marijuana, and Mojo agreed to help. Mojo was successful in obtaining the marijuana and later confirmed the delivery details with Duitch.

III.

Events Culminating in Arrest
On the evening of November 13, 1969, Duitch, Storr, and Mojo met with the undercover agents at the Base Mar Shopping Center. The marijuana was in a van in the shopping center parking lot. When negotiations broke down, the police, who had been alerted by the disguised undercover agents, seized the marijuana and arrested the participants, including Storr and Mojo. See People v. Mojo, 173 Colo. 422, 480 P. 2d 571 (1971).

IV.

The Motions for Judgment of Acquittal and for Judgment Nowithstanding the Verdict
Both Storr and Mojo claim that the trial court erred in denying their motions for judgments of acquittal and assert that the jury

Before:  KEITH and NELSON, Circuit Judges, and JOINER, Senior District Judge.*
PER CURIAM.  This is an appeal from a conviction and sentence for possession of cocaine base (crack cocaine) with intent to distribute it, a crime under 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(a)(1).  The defendant argues (1) that the evidence against him was not sufficient to support a verdict of guilty, (2) that the district court's instructions to the jury were improper, and (3) that the defense was prejudiced by an inadvertent disclosure to the jury of a prior conviction as a juvenile.  Alternatively, the defendant argues that the district court misapplied the sentencing guidelines.  We do not find any of the defendant's contentions persuasive, and we shall affirm both the conviction and the sentence.
* On the morning of March 20, 1992, members of the Shelby County, Tennessee, Sheriff's Department executed a search warrant at an apartment at 2844 Vayu Drive in Memphis.  Defendant Thomas Edmondson and his girlfriend, Nicole Robinson, were sleeping in a back bedroom.  Sheriff's Deputy Michael Coleman found a bag containing 27.74 grams of crack cocaine on top of a stereo in the back bedroom.  A beeper and $975 in cash were found inside a pair of jeans in the same bedroom.  Also found in the apartment were three loaded guns (two of them in a dresser drawer in the back bedroom) and a glass tube used for "cooking" crack cocaine.
There were several people in the apartment, and the sheriff's deputies gathered them in the front room.  Defendant Edmondson told Deputy Denford Galloway that the cocaine and the firearms were his.  The deputies placed Mr. Edmondson under arrest and took him to an office where Deputy Galloway interviewed him again.  During this interview, which was recorded on videotape, Edmondson again stated that he owned the guns and the cocaine.  Nicole Robinson and Jeffrey Turner, a friend of Mr. Edmondson's who was in the apartment on the morning of the search, signed statements indicating that they did not know anything about the cocaine or the guns.
On March 26, 1992, a federal grand jury charged Edmondson with having violated 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(a)(1) by possessing approximately 27 grams of cocaine base with intent to distribute it, and with carrying or using a firearm during and

FINDINGS OF FACTS
Bankers First initiated a lawsuit against, inter alia, Murall, Inc. ("Murall"), J. Hugh Ryall ("Ryall"), and H. Victor Murdaugh, Jr. ("Murdaugh"). The Complaint contained three causes of action. The first cause of action is for the foreclosure of a Note and Mortgage given to Bankers First by Murall dated August 29, 1986. The second and third causes of action are for judgments against Ryall and Murdaugh, respectively, based on joint and several guaranties of payment.
On October 20, 1989 Murall filed its Chapter 11 Petition in this Court. Bankers First appeared on October 23, 1989 before the Master-in-Equity and expressed its intent to proceed on the second and third causes of action against Murdaugh and Ryall. Murdaugh appeared at that hearing and expressed his intent, and that of Ryall, to petition the Bankruptcy Court to extend the automatic stay. Citing equity, comity and judicial economy as the basis for his decision, the Master-in-Equity, over the objection of Bankers First, continued the merits hearing until that point in time after which Murdaugh and Ryall had the opportunity to file their Motion and have it heard by the Bankruptcy Court. By this Motion, the debtor seeks to extend the Automatic Stay so as to stay the state court actions against the guarantors. No evidence was presented at the hearing by the Debtor.

ISSUE
The issue presented is whether the facts and circumstances of this case warrant the extension of the automatic stay under either 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)(1) and (3) or under 11 U.S.C. § 105.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
The Debtor asserts that the action against the guarantors should be stayed because a judgment adverse to the guarantors may be binding upon the Debtor. The pertinent portions of the automatic stay provided for in 11 U.S.C. § 362(a) are:
(1) the commencement or continuation, including the issuance or employment of process, of a judicial, administrative, or other action or proceeding against the debtor that was or could have been commenced before the commencement of the case under this title, or to recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case under this title; [and]
(3) any act to obtain possession of property of the estate or of property from the estate or to exercise control over

Zerby v. Shanon, 964 A.2d 956, 961 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2009). If this Court determines
that counsel’s no-merit letter complies with the requirements of Turner, we then
consider the merits of the parolee’s appeal. Id. at 960. If counsel fails to comply
with the requirements of Turner, we may not consider the merits of the appeal. Id.
             In the matter sub judice, Counsel’s no-merit letter does not satisfy the
technical requirements of Turner because it does not address each of the issues

                                          4
raised in Wright’s petition for review. Counsel’s letter contends that the Board has
statutory authority not to credit any of Wright’s time while he was at liberty on
parole towards his sentence on the firearms offense. The letter does not address
the other issues raised by Wright, including the alleged constitutional violations,
the Board’s authority to detain Wright and impose backtime on his original
sentence, and whether Wright is entitled to credit for the time he spent at
Wernersville.
             As we stated in Zerby, “[a]lthough [the parolee’s] issue may prove not
to be meritorious, it is still incumbent upon Counsel to include it in the No-Merit
[l]etter and explain why it is meritless.”     Zerby, 964 A.2d at 962.     Because
Counsel’s no-merit letter fails to address all of the issues raised by Wright, we
must deny Counsel’s withdrawal application, without prejudice, and grant Counsel
leave to file either a renewed withdrawal application and amended no-merit letter
or a brief on the merits of Wright’s petition for review.

810 ILCS 5/2-104, cmt. 2. See also County of Milwaukee, 602 F.2d at 772-73 (stating that county's argument that it was not a merchant under Wisconsin law because it was not engaged in the manufacture of laboratory computer systems and sought only to purchase a system "ignores the broad U.C.C. definition of a merchant");  Heinrich-Titus-Will Sales, 868 P.2d 169, 173-74 (Wash.Ct.App.1994) (stating that "it is not necessary to possess an inventory to fit within the broad statutory definition of merchant" and holding that automobile broker/dealer "was a merchant who dealt in automobiles;  he held himself out as a dealer in automobiles and appeared to be a dealer in automobiles [and][b]oth parties treated him as one.").3


11
Under this broad definition, Davis properly could be characterized as a merchant.  In County of Milwaukee, 602 F.2d at 772, this court addressed whether the county of Milwaukee was a merchant for purposes of the U.C.C. when it purchased a computerized laboratory information system.  The County asserted that it was not a merchant because "it [was] not engaged in the manufacture, sale or marketing of a laboratory systems or other products, but is engaged in the procurement of supplies, materials, and equipment for the operation of the hospital."  Id. at 772-73.   This court stated that this position "ignore[d] the broad U.C.C. definition of a merchant."  Id. It stated that the facts indicated that the County "[a]rguably '[held] (itself) out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to the practices (or goods) involved int he transaction' because the bid itself indicate[d] knowledge peculiar to the goods being solicited by the County."  Id. at 772.   This court concluded that this reasoning was incorporated into the third definition of merchant, that the County's use of an agent who held himself out as having knowledge and skills peculiar to the goods or practices involved in the transaction "allowed the attribution of his knowledge to the County."  Id. This court noted that the hospital's agents, including one who was a certified public accountant whose responsibilities included management of the hospital's finances and business operations, solicited the bids and "extensively negotiated" the contract.

Here,

Around 2:00 a.m., respondent Joshua Lobeck and his friend Michael Aeshliman went out to the garage to have a cigarette. Parked inside the garage was a Mazda 929, which belonged to Steven Reid, Christopher's father. The idea came up to take the Mazda for a drive, and according to Lobeck, Aeshliman went inside the house to get the keys. Aeshliman, however, recounts the evening somewhat differently. According to Aeshliman, at around 2:15 a.m., Lobeck approached him with the keys to the Mazda. Aeshliman asserts that he told Lobeck that they should ask Christopher for permission before they took the Mazda. Both Lobeck and Aeshliman admit, however, that neither one of them asked Christopher for permission to drive the Mazda. It is also undisputed that because Steven Reid was out of town, no one asked Steven Reid's permission to use the Mazda.
Nevertheless, Lobeck and Aeshliman took the Mazda. Lobeck drove because he was the one with a driver's license. Within two miles of the Reid home, Lobeck approached a curve and lost control of the Mazda. Two wheels went off the road and onto the gravel, causing the car to skid. Lobeck over-corrected, struck a power pole, and the Mazda went airborne, rolled over several times, and landed in the ditch. Lobeck was thrown from the Mazda, but Aeshliman remained inside where Lobeck could hear him screaming that he could not feel his legs.
When the police arrived, they found Lobeck, who smelled of alcohol, outside the Mazda and Aeshliman still in the front passenger seat. Aeshliman was rushed to the hospital where the doctors discovered that he had a severed spine and was paralyzed from the waist down. Police took Lobeck to the hospital for a blood sample, and at 4:27 a.m. his blood alcohol content was .15. A police department accident reconstructionist estimated that Lobeck was driving between 65 and 79 mph at the time of the accident. Later that day, Steven Reid was notified that his Mazda had been damaged in an accident. Reid subsequently reported the automobile stolen and made a criminal complaint against Lobeck.
Aeshliman had insurance coverage that paid for a portion of his medical expenses. In

¶1             Everett Knapp petitions this court for review from the
dismissal of his petition for post-conviction relief. 1 We have considered the
petition for review and, for the reasons stated, grant review but deny relief.

¶2            Knapp was charged with two counts of sexual conduct with
a minor. Regarding the first count, a victim’s relative stated she saw Knapp
inappropriately touching the victim. The victim confirmed this occurred.
Concerning the second count, the victim stated Knapp inappropriately
touched her after she exited the shower. Before trial, Knapp moved to
obtain specific discovery items to support his defense. The court denied his
motion. Pursuant to North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25 (1970), Knapp pled
guilty to two counts of attempted child molestation.

¶3           In his petition for post-conviction relief, Knapp presented
Child Protective Services (“CPS”) reports claiming the victim’s relatives
had been sexually and physically abusing the victim during the period
when Knapp was arrested. The superior court granted an evidentiary
hearing on Knapp’s petition. After hearing the evidence, the court denied
relief.

        On May 16, 2018, Flint Allen, filed a petition for compensation under the National
Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, 42 U.S.C. §300aa-10, et seq., 2 (the “Vaccine

       Petitioner has now filed a motion for attorney’s fees and costs, dated February 4,

[3]  The March 30, 1988 letter may be properly characterized as withdrawal of support based on the representation of counsel for Atlas and Bell at the hearing held in this Court on April 6, 1988. At the hearing, the Court asked counsel whether the Atlas and Bell affirmatively withdrew support for the removal petition or whether they would simply not provide support. Counsel unequivocably stated that Atlas and Bell withdrew support for removal based on diversity.

(b) An "agency or instrumentality of a foreign state" means any entity
(1) which is a separate legal person, corporate or otherwise, and
(2) which is an organ of a foreign state or political subdivision thereof, or a majority of whose shares or other ownership interest is owned by a foreign state or political subdivision thereof, and

OPINION
PER CURIAM:


1
Keith Miller appeals the 24-month sentence imposed on him following his guilty plea to conspiracy to possess heroin with intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C.A. Sec. 846 (West Supp.1995).  Miller contends that the district court clearly erred in determining that he was responsible for 12.27 grams of heroin, USSG Sec. 2D1.1,1 and in finding that he had not accepted responsibility.  USSG Sec. 3E1.1.  We affirm.


2
In late November 1993, Miller sold .034 grams of heroin to a confidential informant.  A short time later, Miller traveled from West Virginia to New York in the company of co-defendant Paul Pridemore and the confidential informant.  Miller and Pridemore purchased 8 bundles of heroin between them.  Each bundle consisted of 10 packets of heroin;  the total weight of the 8 bundles was 2.72 grams.  On their return to West Virginia, Miller and Pridemore were arrested.


3
Miller almost immediately began to negotiate a plea agreement, and entered a guilty plea in February 1994.  Miller's plea agreement specified that the government could inform the probation officer and the district court of any relevant facts, and that the final decision as to his sentence rested with the court.  At Miller's Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing, the government attorney assigned to the case estimated that no more than 6

Before THORNBERRY, AINSWORTH and DYER, Circuit Judges.
PER CURIAM:


1
This matter involves the taxing of attorney's fees as costs and is before us the second time.  On the prior occasion (see Oil & Gas Income, Inc. v. Woods Exploration & Producing Co., 5 Cir., 1966, 362 F.2d 309), we remanded the cases because there were no express findings and conclusions by the District Court on which we could determine whether its award of an attorney's fee of $3,000 was correct.  Though we remanded the case 'for hearing and action in accordance with this ruling,' we stated:


2
'Obviously, we do not intend by our ruling here to require that the District Court try this casr on its merits in order to determine whether it was 'without merit,' for we feel that this may be done largely from the Court's knowledge of the case acquired through the numerous hearings held.'


3
The District Judge properly construed our opinion as requiring only that he make findings of fact and conclusions of law and that he also make the finding required by 15 U.S.C. 77k(e).  This subsection authorizes the Court to tax attorneys' fees as costs in its discretion 'if the court believes the suit or the defense to have been without merit.'  The Court has now complied with our mandate by making findings of fact and conclusions of law and by specifically concluding that the suit lacked merit, thus satisfying the requirements of 15 U.S.C. 77k(e).  The District Court found that an award of attorneys' fees was proper under the circumstances and held:


4
'The Court finds that this suit lacked merit and was so far without basis as to justify the award of attorneys' fees.  Although plaintiff claims it voluntarily dismissed its suit, it did so only after lengthy proceedings in this court and then only when it was required to file a bond in proper form.  Defendant Trotter was put to much expense and trouble in defending this suit.  Under the circumstances, the award of $3,000.00 for attorneys' fees is reasonable.'

THE PEOPLE, Plaintiff and Respondent,
v.
EMILIO AQUILANTE et al., Defendants and Appellants.
Crim. No. 1813. 
California Court of Appeals. Fourth Dist.  
Oct. 15, 1962.
 Russell E. Parsons and Edward I. Gritz for Defendants and Appellants.
 Stanley Mosk, Attorney General, William E. James, Assistant Attorney General, and Jack K. Weber, Deputy Attorney General, for Plaintiff and Respondent.
 COUGHLIN, J.
 The defendants were indicted for the offenses of grand theft, a violation of section 487, subdivision 1 of the Penal Code, of burglary, a violation of section 459 of the Penal Code, and of conspiracy, a violation of sections 182, 484-487 of the Penal Code; were charged with the commission of prior offenses; admitted the latter; denied the former; after trial by jury, were found guilty of all offenses; by judgment, were sentenced to imprisonment in the state prison; moved for a new trial, which was denied; appealed from the order of denial prior to the amendment of section 1237 of the Penal Code eliminating such an appeal; and also appealed from the judgment.
 The indictment in question followed the May 9, 1961, theft of 36 men's suits from a J. C. Penney store in San Diego *532 and 16 men's suits from a Montgomery Ward store in the same city. The defendants and another man appeared in the J. C. Penney store on the date in question; four of them engaged the attention of the sales clerks while one of their party, the defendant Romano, was seen in the men's suit section, but the clerks were not able to wait upon him because they were kept busy by the other four; sometime in the course of events Romano obtained a large box from an employee who was emptying trash into a chute in another part of the store; nothing was purchased; after the men left, the department manager noticed that some suits were missing; and an inventory followed which disclosed a loss of 41 suits valued at approximately $1,950. The defendants were identified by both the manager and a sales clerk as four of the men who had been in the store on the occasion in question. On the same day the defendants and another man were seen in the men's suit department of the Montgomery Ward store; the sales clerks therein were kept busy by some of the defendants and by two customers who were making purchases; the defendant Princ

4. The Right to a Commission
Because the confirmatory letter cannot be construed as a binding agreement, the rights of the parties remain defined by the terms of the oral agreement. "No one will be held to have surrendered or modified any of his contract rights unless he is shown to have assented thereto in a manner that satisfies the requirements of a valid contract." 6 Corbin on Contracts § 1293, at 188. The circumstances of this case clearly show that L.B. Kaye had no intention of relinquishing its rights pursuant to the oral agreement, and even if it had, the duties imposed by that agreement could not be discharged unless the substitute contract were found valid.
As this court noted above, the oral agreement provided that plaintiff would be entitled to a 6% commission upon closing of title. The parties agree that title never closed. They also agree that at the time they entered the oral agreement, they did not discuss whether plaintiff would be entitled to its commission if failure to close was due to Jews for Jesus' willful default. Because the oral agreement does not expressly *167 cover this contingency, plaintiff's right under the present circumstances is determined by New York law. The relevant law holds that a broker is entitled to receive a promised commission even if a condition precedent to payment is not satisfied, if failure to satisfy that condition is due to the defendant's own wrong. See Levy v. Lacey, 22 N.Y.2d at 276, 292 N.Y.S. 2d at 459, 239 N.E.2d at 381; Wagner v. Derecktor, 306 N.Y. at 391, 118 N.E.2d at 573.
The only remaining question, therefore, is whether Jews for Jesus willfully refused to close title. Jews for Jesus argues that its default was legitimately based upon its receipt of an unsatisfactory engineer's report. It contends that it justifiably exercised its right to cancel the purchase pursuant to Section 7(a) of the contract of sale.
The court is not persuaded by Jews for Jesus' attempt to justify its default. Five separate kinds of considerations convince the court that the appeal to the engineer's report is nothing more than a post hoc rationalization of willful failure to close. 1) Jews for Jesus initially offered absolutely no reason for its announced intention not appear at the closing on August 17. If it were genuinely dissatisfied with the engineer's report, it had ample time, prior to the scheduled date of closing, to inform the Irish Institute

       {¶ 82} For the reasons articulated by the Second, Eighth and Eleventh Districts in
Henry, Allen and Allen, respectively, we decline to adopt the rationale of the Twelfth
District in Johnson II. Because we conclude that the good-faith exception to the federal
exclusionary rule does not apply, any evidence obtained as a result of the unlawful search
in this case must be suppressed.
       {¶ 83} The state further contends that, even if suppression of the evidence is
required under the federal exclusionary rule, suppression is not justified under Ohio
Constitution, Article I, Section 14. The state relies on State v. Lindway, 131 Ohio St. 166
(1936), in support of this argument.
       {¶ 84} As the state notes, the Supreme Court of Ohio has never expressly overruled
Lindway. However, the court's subsequent decisions appear to have significantly limited,
if not altogether eliminated, its precedential value. For example, in State v. Chatton, 11
Ohio St.3d 59, 63, fn.4, (1984), the court, discussing the good faith exception to the
federal exclusionary rule, stated that "even should a good faith exception to the
exclusionary rule be recognized for Fourth Amendment purposes, the question still
remains whether we would likewise recognize such an exception under Section 14, Article
I of the Ohio Constitution." Similarly, in State v. Perkins, 18 Ohio St.3d 193 (1985), the
court, finding Section 14, Article I of the Ohio Constitution to be coextensive with the
Fourth Amendment, held that the inevitable discovery exception to the federal
exclusionary rule, as announced in Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. 431 (1984), would be
adopted under Ohio law. Although neither Chatton nor Perkins expressly addressed
Lindway, there would have been no need for the court to determine the applicability of
the good-faith or the inevitable discovery exceptions in the absence of an Ohio
exclusionary rule.
No. 13AP-173                                                                            29


       {¶ 85} Moreover, Ohio appellate courts considering Lindway have acknowledged
its diminished precedential value. In State v. Watson, 117 Ohio App. 333 (9th Dist.1962),
the court noted that the Supreme Court of Ohio had followed Lindway in State v. Mapp,
170 Ohio St. 427 (1960), but

B. The Pending Texas Litigation
The '475 patent is currently the subject of two patent infringement cases pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. On November 16, 2007, WCT filed suit ("the first Texas suit") claiming infringement of the '475 patent by BSC and Johnson & Johnson ("J & J"). (D.I. 12, ex. 1) WCT alleged that "BSC has infringed and continues to infringe the '475 patent by its manufacture, use, sale and/or offer for sale of BSC's Taxus Express products, and other products and services related to coronary, carotid and peripheral stents. ..." (Id., ex. 1 at ¶ 12) (emphasis added) On February 1, 2008, WCT amended its complaint in the first Texas suit by adding as defendants Scimed and Cordis Corporation ("Cordis"), wholly owned subsidiaries of BSC and J & J, respectively. (Id., ex. 2 at ¶¶ 3, 5) The amended complaint mirrored the original, changing only the accused parties (adding Scimed and Cordis) and the accused products (expanding the description from "BSC's Taxus Express products" to the broader "BSC's Taxus products"). (Id., ex. 2 at ¶ 10) On March 13, 2008, WCT again amended the complaint in the first Texas suit by adding Medtronic, Inc., Medtronic USA, and Medtronic Vascular, Inc. (Id., ex. 3 at ¶¶ 6-8) Besides adding defendants, this second amended complaint is the same as the previous version. (Id., ex. 3 at ¶ 13)
On July 25, 2008, WCT filed another suit ("the second Texas suit") in the Eastern District of Texas based on the '475 patent. (Id., ex. 8) In that action, WCT alleged that "Abbott infringed and continues to infringe the '475 patent by its manufacture, use, sale and/or offer for sale of Abbott's XIENCE V Drug Eluting Stent Product...." (Id., ex. 8 at ¶ 8) After the two Texas suits illuminated BSC's possible infringement of the '475 patent based on its sale of Abbott's XIENCE® stents under the PROMUS® brand as well as its sale of drug-eluting stents under the trade name TAXUS LIBERTE®, BSC filed the pending

10
I dissent with respect but without reluctance.  Section 2053(a) of the Internal Revenue Code provides that in determining a decedent's taxable estate there shall be a deduction from the gross estate of


11
such amounts . . . for administration expenses . . . as are allowable by the laws of the jurisdiction, whether within or without the United States, under which the estate is being administered.


12
The estate here was administered in the State of New York and the selling commissions at issue here were held to be allowable as proper expenses by the Surrogate of Warren County in several separate accountings.  The Code unambiguously provides for their deduction if allowed by the jurisdiction administering the estate and neither the Commissioner of Internal Revenue nor the Tax Court, in my view, can properly reverse the State Court determination.  Congress has explicitly left the matter in the hands of the state.


13
In a case squarely in point, the Sixth Circuit reversed the Tax Court's denial of deductibility, stating:


14
By the literal language of § 2053(a), Congress has left the deductibility of administrative expenses to be governed by their chargeability against the assets of the estate under state law.  As otherwise stated, Congress has committed to the considered judgment of the states whether a particular expense is allowable as a proper or necessary charge against estate assets.  In the situation before us, the expenses were admittedly allowable under Michigan law.  They were paid out of probate assets and they were approved in two different accountings filed with the probate court.  Hence they are deductible under § 2053(a).


15
Estate of Park v. Commissioner, 475 F.2d 673, 676 (6th Cir. 1973).  Park is not alone in holding that the plain meaning of the statute controls and that the Congress intended deductibility to be determined by state law.  E.g., Ballance v. United States, 347 F.2d 419, 423 (7th Cir. 1965); Commercial National Bank v. United States, 196 F.2d 182, 185 (4th Cir. 1952); Estate of Louis Sternberger, 18 T.C. 836, 843 (1952), aff'd, 207 F.2d 600 (2d Cir. 1953), rev'd on other grounds, 348 U.S. 187, 75 S.Ct. 229, 99 L.Ed. 246 (1955); see Dulles v

Factual and Procedural Background
On February 11, 1994, Carrie Sebastien rear-ended the vehicle driven by Jules Etienne, Sr., the plaintiff. Plaintiff filed suit for his alleged resulting injuries on December 2, 1994, naming as defendants Ms. Sebastien and her automobile liability insurer, National Automotive Insurance Company. On February 8, 1995, Plaintiff filed his first supplemental and amending petition, in which he named American Indemnity Company as an additional defendant, alleging that it "had in full force and effect a policy of insurance insuring defendant, Carrie Sebastien, for all acts complained of." Having settled his dispute with Carrie Sebastien for the available limits of her liability policy with National Automotive Insurance Company,[1] Plaintiff filed, on March 8, 1995, a motion to dismiss with prejudice his suit against Ms. Sebastien and National Automotive only, "fully reserving all of his rights to proceed against the remaining defendant, American Indemnity Company." That motion was granted on the same date. Finally, on February 26, 1997, Plaintiff filed his second supplemental and amending petition, in which he named Morrow, Morrow, Ryan & Bassett (the law firm) as an additional defendant in the instant litigation. He alleged, as the basis of the law firm's liability, that "defendant, Carrie Sebastien, was acting in the course and scope of her employment for [the] defendant [law firm], and, accordingly, ... [the law firm] and its insurer, American Indemnity Company, are liable for acts of negligence by... Carrie Sebastien." In response, the law firm filed peremptory exceptions of prescription and no cause and/or right of action. These exceptions were denied by the trial court on August 27, 1997. After trial on the merits, the trial court made the following factual findings:
Carrie Sebastien, the driver of the other vehicle[,] was the sole cause of the February 11, 1994 accident. At the time of the accident Ms. Sebastien was within the course and scope of the employment with Morrow, Morrow, Ryan and Bassett.
On February 11, 1994 American Indemnity Company had in full force and effect a policy of liability insurance with policy limits of $1,000,000.00 with Morrow, Morrow, Ryan and Bassett as its named insured.
The court awarded Plaintiff $18,000.00 in general damages, $7,661.20 in lost wages, and $

OPINION NOT REPORTED


MEMORANDUM OPINION BY
JUDGE HEARTHWAY                       FILED: November 16, 2016

            JBS Distribution LLC (Employer) petitions for review from an order
of the Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board (Board) that affirmed the order of a
Workers’ Compensation Judge (WCJ) granting the petition for review/
reinstatement filed by Mirta Irizarry-Delgado (Claimant). Employer argues the
WCJ’s decision was not supported by substantial, competent medical evidence. It
contends the opinions of Claimant’s medical expert were insufficient to show a
causal relationship between the work injury and Claimant’s current condition.
Specifically, Employer asserts the opinions of Claimant’s expert were based on
material inaccuracies and equivocal as a matter of law.    Because the Board
affirmed the WCJ, who relied on incompetent and equivocal medical evidence,
Employer claims the Board committed reversible error. We agree and reverse to
the extent the Board amended the work injury to include an aggravation of the
degenerative lumbar disc disease and an aggravation of the chronic right shoulder
pain.
                                  I. Background
            Claimant worked for Employer for 12 years as a meat inspector. Her
duties included standing on a ladder, pulling frozen hamburger using a meat hook,
and inspecting pieces of meat weighing about 40 pounds. On October 2, 2012, she
sustained a work injury when she fell from a ladder onto a concrete floor, striking
her left elbow.    At that time, Employer’s infirmary treated her left elbow.
Claimant does not speak English so she communicated her injuries through a
Spanish interpreter. She marked only her left elbow on the pain diagram Employer
provided,

WCI argues that the decision in Shell Oil warrants the extraordinary remedy provided by Rule 60(b)(6).  Essentially, WCI contends that the invalidation of the federal derived-from rule provides sufficient basis for vacating the 1989 consent judgment.  To support its position, WCI relies on several cases granting Rule 60(b)(6) relief from consent decrees because of changes to the underlying legal bases of the original decrees.   See Theriault v. Smith, 523 F.2d 601, 602 (1st Cir.1975);   Jordan v. School District, 548 F.2d 117, 122 (3d Cir.1977);   Williams v. Butz, 843 F.2d 1335 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 956 (1988);   United States v. City of Fort Smith, 760 F.2d 231, 233 (8th Cir.1985).  WCI particularly directs this court to the Supreme Court's decision in System Federation, where the Court held that the petitioner was entitled to relief from a consent decree under Rule 60(b)(6) because of subsequent statutory changes.  364 U.S. at 652.


17
A change in controlling law, however, does not automatically provide grounds for relief under Rule 60(b)(6).   See W.L. Gore & Assoc., Inc. v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 977 F.2d 558, 563 (Fed.Cir.1992) (intervening change in patent law did not constitute extreme hardship or prejudice justifying modification of consent order under Rule 60(b)(6));   Bailey v. Ryan Stevedoring Co., Inc., 894 F.2d 157, 160 (5th Cir.1990) (change in decisional law by Supreme Court does not constitute exceptional circumstances justifying relief under Rule 60(b)(6)).  System Federation and the courts of appeals decisions that WCI mentions all involve consent decrees that were injunctive in nature;1  in contrast, the consent judgment in this case involved only monetary damages.  Considering the underlying rationale of Rule 60(b)(6), this factual distinction sets the present case apart from those put forth by WCI.  In examining motions for relief under Rule 60(b)(6), courts look to see if extreme and undue hardship would result in the absence of relief.   Olle, 910 F

STANDARD OF REVIEW
[¶ 9] Motions for summary judgment come before the trial court pursuant to Rule 56(c) of the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides that
[t]he judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.
Formisano v. Gaston, 2011 WY 8, ¶ 3, 246 P.3d 286, 288 (Wyo.2011). We review a grant of summary judgment as follows:
We review a summary judgment in the same light as the district court, using the same materials and following the same standards. [Snyder v. Lovercheck, 992 P.2d 1079, 1080 (Wyo.1999)]; 40 North Corp. v. Morrell, 964 P.2d 423, 426 (Wyo. 1998). We examine the record from the vantage point most favorable to the party opposing the motion, and we give that party the benefit of all favorable inferences that may fairly be drawn from the record. Id. A material fact is one which, if proved, would have the effect of establishing or refuting an essential element of the cause of action or defense asserted by the parties. Id. If the moving party presents supporting summary judgment materials demonstrating no genuine issue of material fact exists, the burden is shifted to the non-moving party to present appropriate supporting materials posing a genuine issue of a material fact for trial. Roberts v. Klinkosh, 986 P.2d 153, 155 (Wyo.1999); Downen v. Sinclair Oil Corp., 887 P.2d 515, 519 (Wyo.1994). We review a grant of summary judgment deciding a question of law de novo and afford no deference to the district court's ruling. Roberts v. Klinkosh, 986 P.2d at 156; Blagrove v. JB Mechanical, Inc., 934 P.2d 1273, 1275 (Wyo.1997).

DISCUSSION
[¶ 10] The district court interpreted this Court's holding in Johnson to require that Mrs. Nodine's wrongful

Frank T. McCoy, John T. Craig, and Robert P. Kelly, Pawhuska, for defendants in error.
*968 WILLIAMS, Justice.
This is an appeal from a judgment of the district court of Osage County affirming the order of the County Court of Osage County, determining the heirs and distributing the assets in the estate of Mildred DeRoin, deceased.
The facts were all stipulated in the district court. Mildred DeRoin died intestate, unmarried and without issue, leaving as her only surviving relatives, a paternal half-brother, Norman DeRoin, a paternal grandfather, John DeRoin, and a maternal half-uncle, John P. Whitetail. That portion of decedent's estate involved in this appeal consisted of property devised to decedent by her maternal grandmother and property inherited from her mother, which property the probate court distributed to John P. Whitetail, the maternal half-uncle, to the *969 exclusion of both Norman DeRoin, the half-brother, and John DeRoin, the paternal grandfather. On appeal to the district court such decree of distribution was affirmed on the theory that both the half-brother and the paternal grandfather are excluded from inheriting such property by the so-called "half-blood statute", 84 O.S. 1951, § 222, and that the maternal half-uncle, as the only person related by blood to the ancestors from whom the property came to decedent, was entitled to take such property. No appeal has been perfected by the half-brother, Norman DeRoin, and as to him the decree has become final. The paternal grandfather, John DeRoin, has perfected this appeal and thereby presents the question of whether the property which came to decedent from her mother and maternal grandmother should go to the paternal grandfather, a full-blood relative of the deceased in the second degree, but who is not of the blood of the transmitting ancestors, or the maternal half-uncle, a relative of the deceased in the third degree, but who is of the blood of the transmitting ancestors.
The statute above referred to, 84 O.S. 1951 § 222, reads as follows:
"Kindred of the half-blood inherit equally with those of the whole blood in the same degree, unless the inheritance come to the intestate by descent, devise or gift of some one of his ancestors, in which case all those who are not of the blood of

         Two months before his parole hearing, petitioner was stopped by a prison guard
after he removed a tablet of prescription morphine from his mouth and placed it in his
pants pocket. Following a hearing, he was found guilty of possession of a controlled
substance. The Board appears to have accepted petitioner’s innocent explanation for the
incident, and the Governor did not cite the incident in reversing the Board. We do not
consider the incident in reviewing the Governor’s denial of parole.


                                             2
       In discussing his commitment crime, petitioner straightforwardly acknowledged
and discussed his conduct and culpability. He expressed unqualified remorse, saying he
“made those choices myself,” did not “blame [Williams] for anything,” and took “full
responsibility for my actions.” He had concluded his violence against Williams and
Chet, Jr. was the result of a violent childhood family life, his alcohol and drug abuse, a
“selfish and self-centered” and “insecure” personality, and the fear of losing the family he
had built with Williams. He said he “dealt with [that fear] in the only way I knew how,”
using violence in an attempt to control Williams. After an extensive analysis of
petitioner’s circumstances, the risk assessment prepared by a psychologist in connection
with his parole hearing rated him a “Low or non-elevated risk of violence.”
       The Board granted parole, noting that although the commitment offense was
“particularly horrible, offensive, and cold,” petitioner had “addressed the drug and
alcohol issues,” and “the positive aspects of your case heavily outweigh the other
considerations . . . .”
       The Governor reversed the decision. His decision “acknowledge[d] Mr. LeBlanc
has made efforts to improve himself while incarcerated,” citing in particular petitioner’s
acquisition of trade skills and participation in substance abuse programs. The Governor
was concerned, however, that petitioner “has failed to sufficiently explain why his history
of domestic violence against Ms. Williams ultimately culminated in his stabbing a
toddler.” The decision noted that being self-centered was a “shallow explanation” for
killing a child, while being a victim of child abuse “does not adequately explain” why he
suddenly chose to kill Chet, Jr. The Governor was also concerned that petitioner could
not “better articulate the reasons for his pattern

OPINION ON STATE'S MOTION FOR REHEARING
ODOM, Judge.
On original submission appellant successfully challenged the trial court's adverse ruling on his motion to quash the indictment. That motion attacked the failure of the indictment to allege that the act "was done without the consent of the owner or other person entitled to give consent." To the extent that old code cases address this issue, Smith v. State, 162 Tex.Cr.R. 132, 282 S.W.2d 876, cited by the unanimous panel on original submission, is on point. The element of forgery under Art. 979, V.A.P.C. (1925) of "without lawful authority" has been brought forward in V.T.C.A., Penal Code Sec. 32.21(a)(1)(A)(i), which requires that the purported maker "did not authorize the act" of making the writing. Not only was the indictment here defective on the basis urged in the motion to quash, but under Smith it was fundamentally defective.
Although this prosecution was not for forgery by making under Sec. 32.21(a)(1)(A), it was brought for forgery by possession with intent to utter under Sec. 32.21(a)(1)(C), which by reference expressly incorporates the elements of Sec. 32.21(a)(1)(A) and (B). Simple use of the word "forge" in the indictment is insufficient to incorporate by reference the missing element. In Reynolds v. State, Tex.Cr.App., 547 S.W.2d 590, a similar argument that the allegation of "unlawful" in a theft indictment was sufficient to supply the missing element that appeared in the statutory definition in V.T.C.A., Penal Code Sec. 31.03(b), was rejected:
"The allegation of `unlawfully' pleads only a conclusion of law omitting the facts necessary to that conclusion."
*468 The State urges that the decision in this case is in conflict with Jiminez v. State, Tex.Cr.App., 552 S.W.2d 469, and Jones v. State, Tex.Cr.App., 545 S.W.2d 771. The element found missing in the indictment in this case was not expressly considered in those cases. Jones discussed failure of the indictment to allege that the accused knew the instrument was forged, and Jiminez discussed,

The taped conversations about cocaine between O'Quinn and Hyde and between Hyde and Joe Middlebrooks6 similarly failed to provide evidence on which a jury could reasonably find that O'Quinn was guilty of a conspiracy to distribute that drug.  In the first of these conversations, O'Quinn called Hyde and was told that "Joe" (Middlebrooks) had been waiting for him but had gone to Texas to purchase cocaine.  In the course of this conversation, Hyde offered to take money from O'Quinn to Middlebrooks in order to enable O'Quinn to join in the cocaine purchase.  While O'Quinn expressed interest in participating in Middlebrooks' cocaine transaction, depending on the quality and price of the drug and asked Hyde to have Middlebrooks call him, he did not agree during the call to have Hyde deliver his money.  A later conversation between Hyde and Middlebrooks disclosed that O'Quinn had not contacted Middlebrooks in Texas to consummate the cocaine transaction.  Not only was agreement between O'Quinn and another coconspirator regarding a cocaine transaction not proven, but O'Quinn's exploratory discussions as to participation in one drug purchase with Middlebrooks were consistent with O'Quinn's distributing cocaine as an independent dealer outside the conspiracy.  Because the jury could not reasonably have concluded upon this evidence that O'Quinn was guilty of conspiracy to distribute either marijuana or cocaine, we must reverse his conviction.


33
Finally, we find merit in Roger Cleckler's assertion that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for conspiracy to distribute cocaine but reject his similar contention with respect to his conviction for conspiracy to distribute marijuana.  The evidence against Cleckler on the marijuana count consists of his confession and the testimony of Anita Clancy.  In a post-arrest admission, Cleckler stated that he began selling marijuana for Hyde some four to six months before Hyde's arrest.  Cleckler admitted receiving as much as four to six pounds of marijuana at a time from Hyde and selling it to his friends in the area.  According to Cleckler, Hyde would collect his money approximately two weeks after each delivery.


34
Cleckler's confession is substantially corroborated by the testimony of Anita Clancy that on two occasions when she was present Cleckler bought several pounds of marijuana from coconspirator Pruitt.  See Smith v. United States, 348 U.S. 147

The only fact in dispute is the occurrence of the rape itself.  Lawrence Cardinal is a forty-eight-year-old American Indian.  He is an uncle by marriage to Tammy Empen, the thirteen-year-old complainant.  Empen lives in a foster home in Iron Mountain, Michigan, but frequently visits her mother, who resides on the Keweenaw Bay Indian Reservation.  Empen testified that during one visit, on November 24, 1984, she walked with Cardinal to an abandoned shack on the reservation.  She testified that while in the shack, he forced her onto a bed and raped her.  Cardinal admits taking a walk with Empen that afternoon, but denies entering the cabin or committing the rape.  A doctor who examined Empen later that night found evidence of spermatozoa and/or seminal fluid but could not testify to a time the intercourse might have occurred.


3
Empen has reported other instances of sexual assault by family members.  Cardinal contends that the trial court committed reversible error by refusing to admit evidence of these prior charges and their subsequent withdrawal.  The government argues that Empen's charges, made against Empen's stepfather and Cardinal, were true and were withdrawn because of fear of retaliation from Empen's mother.  The trial court held this evidence inadmissible under Rule 412, Fed.R.Evid., the federal "rape-shield" rule.  Rule 412 limits the admissibility of evidence of a rape victim's past sexual behavior to three situations:  when constitutionally required, when relevant and more probative than prejudicial on the source of semen or injury, and when relevant and more probative than prejudicial on the issue of consent.  Rule 412(b)(1), (b)(2)(A) and (B), Fed.R.Evid.


4
Cardinal argues that evidence of these prior charges should not have been excluded under Rule 412, as the issue was one of credibility and not prior sexual conduct.  He contends that the evidence is admissible to assess the credibility of the complainant, and should have been admitted in cross examination under Rule 607 and 608(b), Fed.R.Evid.


5
Even accepting Cardinal's argument as excusing compliance with the procedural requirements of the rule, Rule 412(c)(1), Fed.R.Evid., his contention ignores the basic policy of Rule 412.  Its "principal purpose ... is to protect rape victims from the degrading and embarrassing disclosure of

The defendant has contended that the National Freight is a separate and independent entity and not a part of the railroad enterprise. It has been found, however, that it was an agency or instrumentality of the defendant railroad. Such finding did not imply that any part of the railroad's general expense should be charged to the business of the National Freight, nor was it intended that Penna. Railroad should in its accounting of National Freight earnings obtain any indirect benefit by charging a material portion of its general overhead to that venture. Net profit was intended to mean the net increment to Penna. Railroad from the National Freight traffic, the difference between receipts and the out of pocket costs incident to that business; and not the net benefit to Penna. Railroad which might be enjoyed after deducting from net revenues any appreciable portion of the charges for wharves, stockyards, stations and the innumerable items of expense incident to the operation of a large railroad system.
We decline to charge the revenue from the National Freight traffic with that part of the overhead or general expenses of the Penna. Railroad involved in the statement submitted, and must therefore adopt a method, other than those suggested by the defendant, for calculating the net profit received by the defendant from the National Freight traffic.
Although no method has yet been devised for determining the exact cost of the various types of traffic, approximations having a reasonable bases have been used in many instances by public authorities and railroad accountants for the purpose of determining operating costs. Reasonably accurate approximations can be obtained by measuring costs upon a ton mile basis, the unit of measurement being the transportation of one ton of freight one mile. Formulas have been developed using net ton miles, reflecting the weight of the lading, and gross ton miles reflecting the weight of the lading and the car. Using such formulae and the operating statements furnished by the defendant, it is found that the average revenue per ton mile for National Freight traffic was 55% higher than that of the entire system traffic, due to the fact that the forwarder freight consists of the higher rate and more profitable classes.
National Freight loaded car miles were shown in the statement to be 23,354,463, and averaged 15 tons per car as against 28 tons for the whole system. By multiplying the loaded car miles by the tons of lading gives the ton miles which were revenue producing and therefore designated as revenue ton miles; and dividing the revenue ton miles by the gross revenue gives the revenue per ton mile of 1.486 cents as

The trial of this case lasted some three days; the reporter's transcript covers 588 pages and there are numerous exhibits. Our task in preparing the opinion in this involved matter has been greatly facilitated by the excellent briefs filed by counsel for the respective parties. As to various *351 phases of the case the evidence is in sharp conflict. On appeal, however, it is our duty to view the facts in the light most favorable to sustaining the judgment of the lower court, and stated in this light, the material facts are as follows:
Tang, Wey, and Dong, as partners, owned a nightclub business called the "Flamingo Club", in Tucson. Tang was the active partner and represented the partnership in all its transactions with third parties. On May 10, 1948, Philip R. Vetari by written contract purchased this business from the partners.
The agreed sale price was $40,000. Vetari paid $5,000 cash, transferred a piece of real estate agreed to be worth $7,000, assumed an installment loan contract in the sum of $5,000 owed by the partners to the Southern Arizona Bank & Trust Company, and executed a $23,000 promissory note payable eighteen months from date with interest at 6% payable monthly. The note was secured by a mortgage on the business and all of its assets. Vetari went into possession of the premises as sublessee of Tang, who was lessee of Ivancovich, the owner. Vetari spent more than $11,000 for repairs and capital improvements. By January, 1949, for unexplained reasons, Vetari was in dire financial circumstances and in default under many terms of his contract of purchase.
Tang instructed Glenn Ginn, a Tucson attorney, to proceed to forfeit Vetari's rights under the contract. Vetari engaged Frank Watkins, another Tucson attorney, to represent him in a series of negotiations with the partnership designed to arrive at some workable, reasonable and fair settlement of the financial problems. These negotiations culminated in a written contract dated April 21, 1949.
Under this contract the parties intended that Tang should go into possession and operation of the business in an undefined capacity: (1) Tang would enter as owner, declaring a forfeiture of whatever rights the purchaser had acquired by his payments, but, (2) if during the ensuing 18 months Vetari paid his accrued defaults he should have the right to take back the business as owner, in which event Tang

Timothy McVeigh's trial concluded in June of 1997 with a guilty verdict on all counts.  In September of 1997, prior to Mr. Nichols' trial, the government filed a motion to clarify whether the orders restricting extrajudicial statements likewise prohibited the prosecution's cooperation with the Oklahoma grand jury investigating the bombing.  In a hearing held on September 8, 1997, the district court indicated the government could not disseminate materials to Oklahoma authorities.  The court stated "I don't want to be interpreted as trying to obstruct a lawful grand jury in Oklahoma.  On the other hand, my responsibility is to this trial and this case....And  [the Oklahoma state grand jury is] just going to have to wait ... until the conclusion of these proceedings."   ROA Vol.  I, Tr. of 9/8/97, at 21-22.


10
Approximately three months later, after completion of Mr. Nichols' trial, the district court received a letter from the state trial judge conducting the grand jury proceedings in Oklahoma.  In that letter, which was forwarded to all the parties, the judge made specific inquiry whether the two orders at issue here prevented federal assistance in the state proceedings.  Using the letter as a catalyst, the government filed a formal motion requesting removal of any restrictions which would prohibit cooperation with state authorities.  On June 24, 1998, the district court entered an order granting the government's request "insofar as this court's previous orders precluded the federal government's cooperation with the Oklahoma County District Attorney and the especially empaneled state grand jury, except that the government shall not disclose any documents, papers, objects and information provided by the defendants through reciprocal discovery."   ROA Vol.  II, doc. 6149, at 3. On July 1, 1998, Mr. McVeigh filed his notice of appeal.  We granted a stay of the order that same day.2Discussion

As a threshold matter, we must consider whether we have jurisdiction to consider this appeal.  See United States v. Dickstein, 971 F.2d 446, 447 (10th Cir.1992).  Generally, we are limited to considering final orders which are accompanied by the entry of judgment.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1291.  Here, however, we are in a curious procedural posture.  The trial court's June 24 order was issued after entry of judgment in Mr. McVeigh's case.  Indeed, his direct

Facts
Texaco is a Delaware corporation engaged in the production, transportation, refining and marketing of crude oil and its products, more particularly in this case, gasoline. Its gasoline is distributed through approximately 24,000 Texaco branded service stations throughout the United States under the brand names of Fire Chief, Sky Chief, Lead Free and Texaco Gasahol. Texaco, whose sales comprise 5.9 percent of the total retail gasoline sales in the United States, transacts business in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and is engaged in interstate commerce.
Plaintiff William Melso, trading as Melso Texaco Service, owns and operates a Texaco brand service station located at 6554 Frankford Avenue, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and has operated such service station since 1973. Plaintiff Timothy Musser, trading as Musser Texaco, owns and operates a Texaco brand service station located at 2242 Bridge Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and has operated such service station since 1972. The named plaintiffs advance claims common to the class and have fairly and adequately represented the interests of the class at trial.
In the past, Texaco charged its dealers an annual service fee for participating in Texaco's credit card program, which has existed in various forms since 1914. This fee, prior to November 1, 1981, did not exceed $36.00 per year. Immediately prior to November 1, 1981, Texaco had a credit card program in effect under which Texaco agreed to process any Texaco card invoices which were submitted by Texaco retailers to Texaco on authorized credit sales for processing at 100 percent of the face value of the invoices submitted. Before issuing credit cards, Texaco did not consult with dealers regarding the issuance of credit cards and did not consult with dealers on the terms contained in the credit cards. Generally, invitations to members of the public to apply for cards have been mailed out unsolicited, but issued only after a credit check. Texaco currently has issued in excess of 9 million credit cards of which more than 5 million are "active" accounts, that is, the holders of these cards make purchases of Texaco products with them at least once per year.
On August 31, 1981, all Texaco retailers and wholesalers were notified that the Retailer Travel Card Agreement (hereinafter "credit card agreement") between Texaco and its retailers and wholesalers was being amended to take effect as of November 1, 1981 by striking paragraph 8 which provided that:

 All parties  [fn. 1] appeal from a judgment in favor of plaintiffs Home Indemnity Company and Wilkins Draying Company against Transport Indemnity Company, Lathrop Construction Company and The Travelers Insurance Company in a declaratory relief action determining respective rights and liabilities under certain insurance policies. *102
 Questions Presented:
 A. Transport Indemnity Appeal: Was the Pacific Cement and Aggregates, Inc., truck in the process of being unloaded?
 B. The Travelers Insurance Company Appeal: Was the use of Wilkins' crane covered by the Travelers policy issued to Lathrop?
 Record:
 This declaratory relief action arises from the following situation: Lathrop Construction Company (hereafter Lathrop), insured by The Travelers Insurance Company (hereafter Travelers), was a general contractor engaged in constructing certain buildings at the Davis campus of the University of California. Lathrop purchased concrete from Pacific Cement Aggregates, Inc. (hereafter Pacific) which was insured by Transport Indemnity Company (hereafter Transport). Lathrop was engaged in pouring the concrete walls of the second story of a classroom building. Because of the height at which the concrete was poured, it was necessary to use buckets hoisted by a self- propelled crane which Lathrop had rented from Wilkins Draying Company (hereafter Wilkins) insured by Home Indemnity (hereafter Home). The pouring process was accomplished by having Pacific pour the concrete from its truck down a chute into a bucket which was then attached to the crane and hoisted to the place of pouring. The trucks were self-unloading, the only apparatus used in the unloading was the truck's own equipment.
 Pouring of the wall on one side of the building had been completed, and it became necessary to move the crane from one side of the building to the other in

OPINION
CROSKEY, J.
Petitioner City of Huntington Park (the City) seeks a writ of mandate which directs the respondent court to vacate its order on demurrer, which allows plaintiff Gadi Flores (Flores) to proceed with an action under 42 United States Code Annotated section 1983 (hereafter section 1983). Flores's action was filed within one year of the time Flores obtained his majority, but more than a year after the events complained of, which occurred in 1991. The City seeks to bar all claims, based on the statute of *1296 limitations. Flores contends the statute was tolled during his minority under Code of Civil Procedure section 352, subdivision (a) (section 352(a)).[1]
We conclude, as did the trial court, that section 352(a) tolls the statute of limitations in a federal civil rights action during the plaintiff's minority, as it does in civil actions generally. Such tolling is not precluded by Code of Civil Procedure section 352, subdivision (b) (section 352(b)), which provides that section 352 does not apply to actions that are subject to the claim filing requirements of the Tort Claims Act. We accordingly deny the requested writ relief.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
Flores's complaint, filed on April 28, 1994, alleges that City police officers used excessive and unlawful force during the arrest of Flores, then a minor, on or about May 27, 1991. Specifically, Flores alleges he was severely bitten in several parts of his body by a police dog. Flores filed a timely state tort claim, which was rejected by the City. On January 5, 1993, more than a year after rejection of the state tort claim, Flores filed a complaint in federal court. Flores attained majority on August

       board's decision and remanded with directions that the board enter a final administrative

       decision. Id. ¶ 32.

¶ 30          The finding that the board did not render a final administrative decision was prompted by

       a number of procedural irregularities in connection with the failed vote on the motion to grant

       Howe's application for a duty disability pension. First, although a majority of the board voted

       against the motion to grant Howe's application, there was not an affirmative vote by a majority

       of the board as required by the Pension Code to deny the application. Thus, although the board

       chairman stated following the failed vote to grant the application that the board had "denied" it,

       that statement was inconsistent with the only vote taken, i.e., the motion to grant the application

       failed to garner a majority vote. Id. ¶ 22. Second, the board chairman also recited that the board

       had made "findings" even though the decision containing the board's findings "could not have

       been written at that time because the last witness had just testified." Id. Finally, the board did

       not affirmatively vote to adopt the written decision; it was merely circulated to and signed by

       those trustees who had voted against granting Howe's application. Id. ¶ 26.

¶ 31          Noting that it is "elementary" that a final decision of an administrative agency must be in

       writing (id. ¶ 19), Howe further emphasized that "the written decision must be prepared and

       provided to each board member at or before the time the [b]oard votes to take final action on the

       application." Id. ¶ 25. This is because "[t]he [b]oard's only decision is the written version, since




                                                        11
       No. 1-14-0482


       that is the decision setting forth its findings of fact, reasoning, and analysis that judges consider

       during the administrative review process." Id.

¶ 32           In addition to the procedural irregularities precluding a finding that the board had

       rendered a final administrative decision, Howe also considered whether the board's decision was

       invalid because the manner in which it was adopted violated the Open Meetings Act. Howe

       concluded that the Act imposes a "strict requirement" that a public body must take final action

       openly, including voting publicly on any final decision.

[4]  Whitaker v. Borntrager (1954), 233 Ind. 678, 680, 122 N.E.2d 734, 735.
[5]  There is no evidence of the facts enclosed within the parenthesis. We gleaned them from answers to discovery interrogatories and include them here because they are tacitly, if not expressly, conceded. Defendants' answer admits the complaint's allegation that "[o]n December 2, 1969 Denise Driscol was a student of the Delphi Community School Corporation, Defendant." Denise also testified that the "gym class was in the gym of the Delphi School Corporation". Nothing in the record expressly reveals the impliedly apparent governmental nature of the defendant Delphi Community School Corporation. Its name suggests that it is a "community school corporation" within the meaning of that term as the same is defined in Ind. Ann. Stat. § 28-3502(3), the same being section 3 of "The School Corporation Reorganization Act of 1959", Acts 1959, Ch. 202, § 3, also IC 1971, 20-4-1-3(3), which reads, in pertinent part: "The term `community school corporation' shall mean a school corporation ... formed under the provisions of this act... ." Section 9(1) of that Act provides that "[e]very community school corporation ... is hereby declared to be a body corporate and politic ...", to which § 9(2) adds, "... such community school corporation shall have all the powers, rights, duties and obligations of the school cities of the fifth class or any higher class in which such school corporation would fall ... [by the last U.S. census] if ... organized as a school city... ." (As amended by Acts 1963, Ch. 390 § 1). We trust that the trial court possessed actual knowledge through which he was able, without fear of error, to take judicial notice that defendant corporation was a subdivision of the State. Since the arguments of both appellants and appellees are premised on that implied assumption we do not question it.
[6]  In her testimony Denise described the game of bombardment thus:

"Well, you split the class up into two different teams and they stand on opposite sides and they've got

Mrs. Nero attempted to demonstrate McWhite's unsuitability as a guardian or custodian through testimony that he handled the boy roughly; that he had once slapped Vicky; and that he was a reckless driver; and that Mrs. McWhite, the paternal grandmother, was an alcoholic. For his part, McWhite was also critical of Mrs. Nero. He asserted that she was mentally unfit; that while she works the child is left with her two daughters who are busy with their boyfriends; that the child would have to share a room with the two aunts; and that the house lacks a tub. The trial court found that both McWhite and the grandmother were fit persons to care for the child. However, on the grounds that the interests of the child would be better *702 served, the trial court awarded custody and guardianship to the grandmother with liberal rights of visitation to the father.
In the usual custody case, when the contest is between two parents, both of whom are fit persons and have equal rights to custody, then the polestar test of "best interest of the child" is clearly controlling. Snedaker v. Snedaker, 327 So.2d 72 (Fla. 1st DCA 1976). In other words, all other things being equal, the best interests of the child should control. However, when the contest is between a parent and someone else, the rights of the parent as well as the welfare of the child must be considered.[1]State ex rel. Sparks v. Reeves, 97 So.2d 18 (Fla. 1957). In such cases, the parents' natural right to custody must give way only when the child's welfare requires it or the parent is in some way disabled. In Reeves, for instance, the supreme court approved the temporary grant of custody to the grandparents based upon the father's temporary inability to care for the children after the mother's death, but cautioned that the father would be entitled to custody once the disability was removed.
Florida courts subscribe to the theory that a parent has a natural right to enjoy the custody, fellowship and companionship of his offspring:
While according to the trial Judge a broad judicial discretion in the matter we nevertheless cannot lose sight of the basic proposition that a parent has a natural God-given legal right to enjoy the custody, fellowship and companionship of his offspring. State ex rel. Weaver v. Hamans, 118 Fla. 230, 159 So. 31. This is a rule older than the

In her first assignment of error, Dillon contends the trial court erred in denying her motion to quash which alleged an illegal stop and arrest.

Except as provided by R.S. 32:361.1(C), no person may operate a motor vehicle with any object or material placed on or affixed to the front windshield or to front side windows of the vehicle so as to obstruct or reduce the driver's clear view through the front windshield or front side windows, nor place on or affix to the front windshield or the front side windows of a motor vehicle, any transparent material if the material alters the color or reduces the light transmission of the windshield or front side windows.
In State v. Gamberella, 633 So.2d 595, 601 (La.App. 1 Cir.1993), writ denied, 94-0200 (La. 6/24/94); 640 So.2d 1341, the court explained:
Statutes are presumed to be valid; whenever possible, the constitutionality of a statute should be upheld. State v. Brenner, 486 So.2d 101 (La.1986). Because a state statute is presumed constitutional, the party challenging the statute bears the burden of proving its unconstitutionality. State v. Griffin, 495 So.2d 1306 (La.1986). Attacks on the constitutionality of a statute may be made by two methods. The statute itself can be challenged, or the statute's application to a particular defendant can be the basis of the attack.
In the case sub judice, Dillon challenges the statute itself as well as its application to her. She claims this statute is constitutionally illegal for a number of reasons. First, she claims Louisiana does not have a legitimate state interest in regulating the degree of window tinting on cars. She also argues that the law relies upon the visual acuity of the enforcer, and its accuracy is subject to environmental variables, making it a constitutionally unacceptable method of enforcement. She avers the human eye is incapable of determining the degree of tint of any vehicle. Dillon further argues the regulatory scheme of the tint law among the states is dissimilar and, thereby, violates the commerce clause of the United States Constitution

PER CURIAM:

               Tron    Manuel      Littlejohn         appeals    the   district      court’s

order accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and

denying relief on his 28 U.S.C. § 2254 (2006) petition. ∗                                   On

appeal,    we       confine    our   review          to   the   issues     raised    in     the

informal brief.          See 4th Cir. R. 34(b).                   Because Littlejohn’s

informal brief does not challenge the bases for the district

court’s dismissal of twenty-one of his claims, Littlejohn has

forfeited      appellate       review      of    those     claims.         With    regard    to

Littlejohn’s claim that counsel rendered ineffective assistance

by failing to object to an in-court identification (the only

claim properly before the court), Littlejohn fails to show any

error in the district court’s denial of relief.                            Accordingly, we

affirm that claim for the reasons stated by the district court.

Littlejohn v. Reynolds, No. 1:09-cv-01718-TLW (D.S.C. Sept. 16,

STATE of Nebraska, Appellee,
v.
Walter A. CAREY, Appellant.
No. 41286.
Supreme Court of Nebraska.
October 12, 1977.
*142 Padley & Dudden, P. C., Ogallala, for appellant.
Paul L. Douglas, Atty. Gen., Steven C. Smith, Asst. Atty. Gen., Lincoln, for appellee.
Heard before WHITE, C. J., and SPENCER, BOSLAUGH, McCOWN, CLINTON, BRODKEY and WHITE, JJ.
McCOWN, Justice.
The defendant, William Anthony Carey, pleaded guilty to a charge of unlawful possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. The District Court imposed a sentence of not less than 1 year nor more than 2 years imprisonment and a fine of $2,000. In this appeal the defendant contends that the sentence was excessive; that it was based upon erroneous information in the presentence report; and that he was therefore denied due process.
At the time of his arrest the defendant was the driver of a pickup camper which contained 43 burlap bags of marijuana weighing 2,086 pounds. The defendant knew that the truck contained marijuana and told officers he was to receive $5,000 for driving. Following his guilty plea and the filing of a presentence investigation report, the defendant was sentenced to 1 to 2 years imprisonment and fined $2,000. The statutory penalty provides for a sentence of not less than 1 year and not more than 5 years imprisonment, or a fine of not more than $2,000, or both.
The defendant was 26 years old, single, and a resident of Vermont at the time of his arrest. He worked as a carpenter during the summer months and took odd jobs during the off-season. The presentence investigation report discloses one prior conviction for petit theft in California in 1972, for which the defendant was placed on 6 months probation.
The focus of defendant's argument on appeal rests on the assertion that the presentence investigation report erroneously failed to mention that the California conviction had been set aside after successful completion of probation. There is nothing in the record to substantiate the claim that the California conviction was, in fact, set aside. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the defendant or his counsel asked to inspect the presentence investigation report, nor that a request was ever denied. The record does establish that the sentencing court treated the offense now before us

 On December 7, 1943, Jesse executed a grant deed of the property here involved to himself and plaintiff Carrie, as his wife, as joint tenants. On January 13, 1948, Carrie Patterson executed a quitclaim deed thereto to Jesse, reciting a consideration of $10. This is the instrument plaintiff seeks to cancel in this action on the ground of fraud and undue influence. On January 17, 1948, Jesse executed his will in which he devised to defendant Rubie Lee Davis the real property here in question, and for some reason devised therein the adjoining property held by himself and Carrie as joint tenants, to his "wife, Carrie Patterson." It appears that the quitclaim deed here in question and the will were prepared by an attorney and that both Jesse and Carrie were present in his office when their provisions were being discussed and that both parties appeared before a notary public where the quitclaim deed was acknowledged. Plaintiff claims she did not understand the nature of the transaction, that the will was not mentioned, and also claimed that the blanks in the quitclaim deed were not filled in when she signed it; that she did not understand that she was divesting herself of her interest in the property; that she was not familiar with the practices *156 of the business world and did not have the benefit of independent legal advice.
 As opposed to this claim, the attorney testified that in plaintiff's presence Jesse stated that he wanted to prepare a deed and a will; that he brought plaintiff with him because she had an interest in the matter; that he and his wife Carrie owned this property and that they had agreed that she would transfer her interest in it to him and he would leave a will by which he would devise the property to his niece because he was under obligation to her; that plaintiff participated in the conversation and approved the transfer and offered no objection; that subsequently the deed and will were executed and returned to him and the deed was then recorded; that in 1950, when he learned of Jesse's death, he wrote to plaintiff and Mrs. Davis notifying them of his possession of the will; that these ladies came to his office together and that they discussed the terms of the will and no objection was voiced by either; that plaintiff wanted to know the procedure necessary to obtain title to the house in which she then resided; that he advised her it would come to her under the terms of the joint tenancy deed and she never made any claim to the property here in question.
 Rubie Lee Davis testified that her uncle practically raised her; that he was unable

Fairfax first contends Lords violated the requirements of section 2034, specifying the requirements for exchange of expert witness information, and that the trial court erred in allowing him to do so. We agree.
Section 2034, subdivision (1) expressly contemplates a "a mutual and simultaneous exchange by all parties of a list containing the name and address of any natural person [whose] expert opinion any party expects to offer in evidence at the trial." Subdivision (f) of section 2034 states, in pertinent part, that "[t]he exchange of expert witness information shall include either of the following: [¶] (A) A list setting forth the name and address of any person whose expert opinion that party expects to offer in evidence at trial. [¶] (B) A statement that the party does not presently intend to offer the testimony of any expert witness."
Subdivision (h) of section 2034 allows any party who engaged in the initial exchange to supplement his or her list: "Within 20 days after the exchange described in subdivision (f), any party who engaged in the exchange may submit a supplemental expert witness list containing the name and address of any experts who will express an opinion on a subject to be covered by an expert designated by an adverse party to the exchange, if the party supplementing an expert witness list has not previously retained an expert to testify on that subject."
As Fairfax points out, Lords' initial expert witness exchange did neither of the things required by subdivision (f)  it neither listed any experts that he "expected" to call as witnesses, nor did it state that he had no present intention to offer expert testimony. Instead, Lords expressly declined to name any retained experts in the initial exchange, while "reserv[ing] the right to designate experts in rebuttal to [Fairfax's] designations." He did list 26 treating physicians and other healthcare professionals, but none of them was designated as an "expected" witness. Lords *855 merely "reserve[d] the right to call [them] as expert witnesses." The list includes not a single name of any witness Lords "expected" to call.
However, once Lords saw Fairfax's expert list, which included one retained witness, he responded with his own "rebuttal" list of two retained experts.
The effect of Lords' expert designation was to delay his own list of "expected" witnesses until after he had seen the list put forth by Fairfax. Lords does not deny that this was his

 I concur in Mr. Justice Schauer's dissenting opinion.
 I am aware of no type of error that is recognized by California's Constitution (art. VI,  4 1/2) as being "necessarily prejudicial" in the sense of automatically requiring or permitting reversal of a superior court judgment. Our court has no power to create a ground for automatic reversal. In cases wherein the solemn death penalty has been adjudicated--certainly no less imperatively than when other consequences are at stake--the question on appeal must always involve a conclusion of relativity based on the entire record, including the evidence.
 This court should not give the semblance of cheapening its function by even an implication that a reversal can be automatic. The issue is important to the defendant because his life is at stake; it is more important to the people of California because their lives are at stake every day and every night, in their jobs, in their homes, and upon the streets, unless potential killers are deterred by fear of the law. They will fear the law only in proportion to the fidelity of its enforcement. *386

heat in the home was a small electric space heater and the electricity was about to

be shut off. The pipes were frozen, which prevented them from having fresh

water or being able to use the toilet. There was also very little food in the home.

These circumstances occurred because Travis and Stacy were both unemployed

and had exhausted community support options. Their only income was from

Stacy’s disability check. The case plan, while requiring both Travis and Stacy to

work on their communication skills, did require several things either parent could

have completed without the other’s cooperation.        Travis needed to complete

parenting classes with Proctor, to complete a substance abuse assessment and a

psychological assessment, to obtain and retain employment, to complete two

weeks of GED classes in order to be eligible for food stamps, to obtain stable

housing, and to visit with his children.        Stacy also needed to complete the

parenting classes with Proctor, complete a substance abuse assessment and a

psychological assessment, obtain and retain employment or provide a medical

excuse why this was not possible, obtain stable housing, and visit with the

children. Although many of these objectives could have been completed as a

couple, there was no requirement that this had to occur. These requirements, if

met, would have allowed the children to be placed with either or both of their

parents.

       {¶18} Travis only met with Proctor a few times and appeared for the first

half of the psychological assessment. He also missed several visits. Stacy also

only met with Proctor a few times and appeared for the first half of the

psychological assessment. The testing she did complete was deemed invalid.

Additionally, there were concerns raised concerning a possible substance abuse

problem with Stacy due to her many trips to emergency rooms for pain killers and

statements made by Travis that Stacy was addicted to the pain killers. She also

missed several visits. Moreover, neither parent was able to obtain and retain

employment nor was either parent able to obtain and retain stable housing.

Although they were given substantial financial assistance in locating and

obtaining an apartment, they only paid two months rent from Stacy’s disability

II. REMOVAL JURISDICTION UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT
Pursuant to an order of this Court, the parties were invited to address the implications of three cases: International Paper Co. v. Ouellette, 479 U.S. 481, 107 S.Ct. 805, 93 L.Ed.2d 883 (1987); Ford v. Murphy Oil U.S.A., Inc., 750 F.Supp. 766 (E.D.La.1990); and Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Association, ___ U.S. ___, 112 S.Ct. 2374, 120 L.Ed.2d 73 (1992).[2]
In Ford v. Murphy Oil, the federal district remanded the plaintiffs common law claims to the state court. Ford, 750 F.Supp. at 773. Even though, for argument's sake, it assumed that the common law claims of the plaintiffs were preempted by the Clean Air Act or the Clean Water Act, the federal court recognized that neither act contains any special jurisdictional grant like ERISA or the labor statutes or provides any remedies like those sought by the plaintiffs. See id.
Although a cursory glance at Gade v. National Solid Wastes might imply some possibility of federal preemption in this action, a careful analysis of that decision demonstrates no support for an argument that the Clean Air Act preempts the plaintiffs' claims. In Gade, the Court held based upon the provisions and purposes of the entire Occupational Health and Safety Act:

*1282 nonapproved state regulation of occupational safety and health issues for which a federal standard is in effect is impliedly pre-empted as in conflict with the purposes and objectives of the OSH Act.
Gade, at ___, 112 S.Ct. at 2383 (citations omitted). In Gade, the Court recognized that Congress mandated that states comply with an approval process to implement any different, whether stricter or not, standards for occupational health or safety issues for issues already regulated by federal law or regulations. Id. Under the OSH Act, states are permitted to assume an enforcement role without federal approval only if no federal standard is in effect. Id. The federal Clean Air Act (the CAA) and the federal Clean Water Act (the CWA) do not impose any such restriction upon the states.
The Gade decision addresses the express and implicit supremacy of federal regulation, under the OSH Act, over state regulation. The Court

We review the decision of the ALJ to determine whether his findings are supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. Jenkins v. Apfel, 196 F.3d 922, 924 (8th Cir. 1999). Mr. Ross argues that the ALJ's credibility determination under Polaski v. Heckler, 739 F.2d 1320 (8th Cir. 1984), is not supported by the record. He specifically challenges three of the ALJ's findings, all of which are essential to the ALJ's holding that he is capable of sustaining substantial gainful activity at the sedentary level. First, the claimant challenges the ALJ's finding that the objective medical record does not document physical abnormalities reasonably capable of producing the intractable pain and fatigue that he alleged. Second, he maintains that the ALJ did not give the opinions of his treating physician, Dr. Londer, adequate weight. Third, he challenges the ALJ's finding that his daily activities are inconsistent with a complete inability to do any work.

At the hearing, Mr. Ross testified that his sickle cell anemia causes him severe pain and fatigue. He testified that he had no pain-free days. On the days when the pain is most severe, he takes his medication and lies still. On these days, he will spend the whole day in bed. When he is in so much pain that he cannot deal with it at home, he goes to the emergency room. However, Mr. Ross testified that three or four days out of the week the pain was somewhat better.


8
The ALJ found that "the objective record does not document physical abnormalities reasonably capable of producing the intractable pain or other symptoms alleged by the plaintiff." To support this, the ALJ referred to the testimony of Dr. Hammarsten, a medical expert who testified at the hearing. Dr. Hammersten commented on a medical report dated October 13, 1996, that stated that Mr. Ross had a microcytosis, which is a feature not associated with sickle cell anemia. Moreover, a microcytosis would suggest the presence of an alpha-thalassemia trait, which would be beneficial to Mr. Ross's condition.


9
We do not think that Dr. Hammersten's testimony about the microcytosis is probative evidence. Even if a microcytosis is not normally associated with sickle cell anemia, the Commissioner does not dispute that Mr. Ross does indeed have sickle cell anemia. Moreover, Dr. Hammarsten

DISCUSSION
LRA filed an exception of prescription in this court alleging that the claimant's April 2002 claim for workers' compensation benefits has prescribed because it was submitted more than two years after LRA's last acknowledged indemnity payment in February 2000. Alternatively, LRA argues that the claim has prescribed because it was filed more than one year after claimant began working at CTC in October 2000, when indemnity benefits were not owed.
In case of personal injury at work, all claims for payments shall be barred unless *1059 within one year after the accident a formal claim has been filed with the office of workers' compensation. Where such payments have been made, the limitation shall not take effect until the expiration of one year from the time of making the last payment, or three years from the last payment of supplemental earnings benefits. LSA-R.S. 23:1209(A).
In the present case, the record shows that in October 2001, LRA paid claimant the amount of $4,434.84, which reflected the payment of indemnity benefits in settlement of a dispute between the parties. In its brief, LRA asserts that prescription begins to run on the date of the last "acknowledged" payment of indemnity benefits or from the last month in which such benefits were allegedly owed. However, Section 1209(A) provides that where payments have been made in a case, the time limitation takes effect one year after "the time of making the last payment." Thus, contrary to LRA's assertion, the prescriptive period does not depend upon when the employer acknowledged payment of indemnity benefits or upon the date when such payments were allegedly owed. Since LRA's last payment of benefits was in October 2001, the April 2002 claim was timely filed. Consequently, LRA's argument lacks merit and the exception of prescription shall be denied.

Solidary Liability of Successive Employers
In two assignments of error, LRA contends the WCJ erred in finding that LRA is solidarily liable for indemnity and medical benefits. LRA argues that CTC is solely liable for compensation benefits and medical expenses because claimant had recovered from her initial work injury when the December 2001 accident occurred.
When a combination of work-related accidents causes a disability, or where by virtue of a second accident a prior injury is aggravated causing disability, both the subsequent employer and the employer at the time of the first work-related accident are solidarily liable for compensation benefits and medical expenses.

Corporation (ABDM & P), Cena Corporation (Cena), and Enrique Fernandez. The trial court entered a summary judgment in favor of ABDM & P and Cena, and the case proceeded to trial against Fernandez.
At trial, Balsera sought damages for her wrongful death action in the amount of $98,367.00 for loss of services and $288,373.00 for loss of support. The estate claimed $2,529.30 in damages. The jury returned a verdict of $100,000.00 for Balsera and $290,000.00 for the estate. The trial court denied the appellant's motion to conform the verdict to the requested amount of damages, but granted Fernandez's motion for remittitur against the verdict for the estate. When the estate rejected remittitur, the trial court ordered a new trial to determine damages on the estate's claim, and entered judgement for Balsera in the amount of $100,000.00. Finally, the trial court denied Fernandez's motion, pursuant to section 768.041(2), Florida Statutes (1985), for setoff based upon monies he allegedly paid to Balsera in compensation prior to trial.
Balsera and the estate appeal the summary judgment entered in favor of ABDM & P and the trial court's denial of their motion to conform the verdict to the clear intent of the jury. Fernandez cross-appeals the denial of his motion for setoff. We reverse the judgment entered against Fernandez and the trial court's order for a new trial, finding that the trial court erred in denying

KEITH P. ELLISON, District Judge.
Pending before the Court is Plaintiffs'/Counter-Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 18). After considering the parties' filings, all responses and replies thereto, and the applicable law, the Court finds that the Plaintiffs' motion should be denied.

I. BACKGROUND
This is a declaratory judgment action in which Plaintiffs Underwriters at Lloyds, Syndicate 242, and International Catastrophe Insurance Managers, LLC ("Lloyds" or "Plaintiffs") seek a judicial declaration that there is no coverage under a named peril commercial property insurance policy, on the grounds the insured failed to comply with a provision of the policy. The facts of the case are undisputed.[1] Lloyds issued Named Peril Commercial Property Policy No. 42-7560012092-L-00 ("insurance policy" or "policy"), covering windstorm and hail damage, to Defendant Turtle Creek Partnership, Ltd., d/b/a Turtle Creek Apartments ("Turtle Creek" or "Defendant"), providing the Turtle Creek apartment complex in Houston with "coverage for loss or damage directly caused by wind and hail." (Defendant's, Turtle Creek Apts. Resp. to Pls.' Mot. for Summ. J., Doc. No. 23, Ex. A, at ICAT NPNA 204 (10 06).) The effective policy period ran from May 27, 2008, to May 27, 2009.

merely provide Capital Metro the option to perform. Such optional and discretionary contracts are

not legally binding and thus do not fall within the plain meaning of “contractual obligations.”

Capital Metro, on the other hand, asserts that “subject to appropriation” contracts should be included

in calculating the transit authority’s contractual obligations because: the phrase means merely an

obligation that arises from a contract, the “subject-to-appropriation” condition exists even without

such explicit language in a contract, and the legislature intended to include such multi-year contracts.

               Virtually all multi-year contracts entered into by Capital Metro have subject-to-

appropriation clauses. Capital Metro claims that it has conformed its contracts to the requirements

of Texas law by incorporating these subject-to-appropriation clauses, and that the condition of annual

appropriation would exist anyway as a matter of law if not explicitly stated in the contract. It bases

this argument on a statute prohibiting a transit authority from conducting any business in a fiscal year

until it has adopted an annual operating budget of all major expenditures. See Tex. Transp. Code

Ann. § 451.102(a) (West 1999) (“A board shall adopt an annual operating budget of all major



                                                   6
expenditures by type and amount. The board shall adopt the budget before the beginning of the fiscal

year to which the budget applies and before the authority may conduct any business in the fiscal

year.”). Payment on a multi-year contract necessarily falls within the ambit of “conducting

business.” Because Capital Metro cannot, therefore, perform on a previously negotiated contract

until the budget has been approved and expenditures under that contract provided for in the budget,

it follows that by law a transit authority’s multi-year contractual obligations are subject to yearly

budget appropriation.

               Furthermore, Capital Metro argues, many governmental entities routinely use subject-

to-appropriation clauses in contracts because of constitutional limitations on the creation of debt by

cities and counties, which restrict expenditures to money from current revenues. See Tex. Const. art.

XI, §§ 5 & 7. For instance, the local government code provides that if a contract contains subject-to-

appropriation language, the contract is a commitment of the local government’s current revenues

only. See Tex.

Richard Carmichael appeals from his conviction for first degree escape and first degree kidnapping. He argues that the State failed to arraign and try him in a timely manner.
In July 1983, Richard Carmichael was incarcerated in the Washington State Reformatory in Monroe, where he was serving time for robbery and escape. On July 15, 1983, he was taken to the hospital for treatment of stab wounds. The following day, with the help of an armed accomplice, he tied up his guard and left the hospital. The State filed a complaint in Everett District Court on August 22, 1983, *895 alleging first degree escape and also issued a warrant for Carmichael's arrest.
Meanwhile, Carmichael had been arrested in Nevada on August 19, 1983, and, in connection with matters unrelated to the Washington case, charged with two counts of murder. He was convicted on both counts and given two consecutive life sentences which were to begin upon completion of any previously imposed Washington sentences.
In March of 1984, Carmichael notified the prosecutor's office in Snohomish County that he was incarcerated in the Nevada State Prison in Carson City and requested that he be returned to Washington to stand trial on the escape charge. The prosecutor denied the request.
On April 9, 1985, Washington and Nevada entered into an agreement pursuant to the Western Interstate Corrections Compact, RCW 72.70.010, whereby Carmichael would serve the remainder of his Washington sentence in Nevada, but the State of Washington would maintain jurisdiction over him.
After a potential escape incident involving Carmichael, the Nevada prison authorities requested that he be returned to the Washington State Reformatory. He arrived at Monroe on December 18, 1986, and on that same day, the Snohomish County prosecutor's office was notified of Carmichael's custody status.
On January 12, 1987, the previously filed district court complaint charging Carmichael with escape was dismissed. On May 4, 1987, the State filed an information in superior court charging Carmichael with first degree escape and first degree kidnapping. Carmichael was arraigned on May 18, 1987, at which time he duly noted his objection to the date of arraignment.
Carmichael brought a motion to dismiss based on CrR 3.3, arguing that he should have been arraigned on the initial escape charge no later than 14 days

FISHER, Circuit Judge.

       Reuben and Maleka Cohen 1 appeal the District Court’s decision to grant summary

judgment in favor of KidsPeace National Centers, Inc. (“KidsPeace”) and Milton Adams,

M.D. The District Court found that there were no genuine issues of material fact and

concluded that the uncontested facts could not constitute gross negligence as a matter of

law. For the reasons set forth below, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.

                                              I.

       We write exclusively for the parties, who are familiar with the factual and

procedural background of the case, and thus we set forth only the facts necessary to our

analysis. Chloe Cohen, the daughter of Reuben and Maleka Cohen, suffered from a long

history of mental illness, including aggression disorders, eating disorders, and suicidal

ideation. On January 9, 2002, KidsPeace admitted Chloe, who was sixteen years old, into

its residential treatment facility in Orefield, Pennsylvania. Upon her admission, Dr.

Milton Adams, a child psychiatrist and independent contractor of KidsPeace, performed

an initial psychiatric evaluation of Chloe, and found that she was not at risk of

committing suicide.2 At the time of her admission, Dr. Adams and KidsPeace had not yet


1. The Parties

The plaintiff in this action, Robert Rios ("Rios"), is a Deputy in the Broward County, Florida Sheriff's Office. Complaint, ¶ 1. The defendants are Navarro, the Sheriff of Broward County, Florida, and employees of his office. Complaint, ¶¶ 2-7. Rios, to this date, is still employed as a deputy sheriff in Broward County. Complaint, ¶ 9.

2. General Allegations

The complaint alleges that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy to injure Rios in his professional employment. See, e.g. Complaint, ¶¶ 83-84. The plaintiff further alleges that this conspiracy lasted over several years, and consumed several instances.
Specifically, Rios alleges that after he determined that a vehicle seized in a police operation should be released, several defendants altered the Rios' authorization slip to reflect that it was held for confiscation and erroneously released by the Rios. Complaint, ¶¶ 21-30. After several defendants conducted an investigation of the plaintiff, they concluded that the plaintiff had the authority to release the vehicle. Complaint, ¶¶ 32-54.
The complaint further alleges that one defendant attempted to interfere with an investigation conducted by the state attorney of the other defendants' actions in the above matter. After the state attorney recommended that the sheriff handle the matter administratively, no investigation was conducted by the sheriff. Complaint, ¶¶ 55-59.
The complaint also states that because certain defendants misused polygraphs *1160 which resulted in the dismissal of charges against other individuals, Rios was the subject of numerous administrative violations. In addition, Rios was later accused by a female inmate of sexual misconduct while the plaintiff administered a polygraph test to the inmate. After an administrative hearing, the sheriff's complaint review board voted in favor of Rios. Complaint, ¶¶ 60-77.
In essence, Rios complains that he was subject to a continuing barrage of complaints within the sheriff's office. Further, the plaintiff states that the other defendants received promotions or raises from the sheriff. Complaint, ¶¶ 78-79.

3. § 1983 Allegations

Count One of the complaint states that the plaintiff was deprived by the defendants, under color of state law, of the following rights:
(1) Freedom from deprivation of liberty without due process of law;
(2) Freedom to live and work as (plaintiff) desires;
(3) Freedom to pursue a livelihood and vacation without any stigma,

CURTIS WAYNE SMITH, Appellant

V.

THE STATE OF TEXAS, Appellee




On Appeal from the 262nd District Court
Harris County, Texas
Trial Court Cause No. 950676




MEMORANDUM OPINION

          Curtis Wayne Smith, appellant, entered a plea of nolo contendere to a felony
charge of aggravated assault
 without an agreed recommendation for punishment. 
The trial court found appellant guilty and assessed punishment at three years in
prison.  In three issues, appellant argues that (1) the trial court abused its discretion
in accepting appellant’s plea after appellant stated he did not believe he was guilty;
(2) appellant’s trial counsel was ineffective for allowing appellant to plead nolo
contendere after appellant stated he did not believe he was guilty; and (3) appellant’s
trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to zealously urge appellant’s
innocence.
          We affirm.
Factual and Procedural Background
          This is a case of road rage.  Appellant pulled out of a parking lot and onto the
feeder road of a highway.  In doing so, appellant entered the flow of traffic directly
in front of a Harris County constable, who was driving his personal car.  The
constable changed lanes, passed appellant’s van, then cut in front of appellant.  
Appellant passed the constable and slammed on his brakes in front of the constable’s
car.   According to appellant’s statement, the constable made a rude gesture, and,
when appellant started driving again, the constable followed him, riding his bumper
and switching lanes, scaring appellant.  At some point, appellant stopped in a parking
lot, got out of his van holding a crowbar, and came up to the constable’s car. 
Appellant struck the constable’s car with his hand several times and yelled to the
constable, “Get out, I’m going to kick your a** for following me.”  The constable
called for police assistance; appellant got back into his van and drove away; and the
constable followed.   Appellant again stopped his van and told the constable he would
“kick a** if you don’t stop following me.”  The constable

On
rehearing, the attorney general argues that Mallory=s recitation is Ainconsistent with personal knowledge@ and cites Dailey v. Albertson=s, Inc., 83 S.W.3d 222 (Tex. App.CEl Paso 2002, no pet.), for the
proposition that the defect is one of substance and so may be raised for the
first time on appeal.  In Dailey, the affiant recited that the facts in
his affidavit were based on his personal knowledge, but the content of the
affidavit affirmatively showed that he lacked personal knowledge.  See id. at
227.  Here, Mallory stated in his motion that he received the attached notice
of hearing from the attorney general, a matter clearly within his personal
knowledge.  Further, the attorney general does not dispute that the attached
notice was the notice he sent, and he does not contend that he sent any other
notices to Mallory.  Although the attorney general cites additional
authorities, none of them hold that a complaint about the recitation of
personal knowledge in a verification may be made for the first time on appeal. 
For this reason, we overrule the attorney general=s motion for rehearing.
We next turn to the substance of this
appeal.  In his second issue, Mallory argues that the trial court erred in
denying his motion for new trial and failing to set aside the default judgment
because he did not receive proper notice of the potential for a disposition of
his case or default setting.  We agree that the notice sent to Mallory did not give him proper notice
that his case could be determined on the merits or a final default judgment
taken in his absence.  The trial court abused its discretion in denying the
motion for new trial.
A trial court=s order denying a
motion to set aside a default judgment or for new trial is reviewed under an
abuse-of-discretion standard.  Strackbein v. Prewitt, 671 S.W.2d 37, 38
(Tex. 1984); Martinez v. Martinez, 157 S.W.3d 467, 469 (Tex. App.CHouston [14th
Dist.] 2004, no pet).  The trial court abuses its discretion if it acts without
reference

sufficient to support a conviction, we determine “whether there is substantial evidence in

the record, when viewed in the light most favorable to the government, to support the

conviction.” United States v. Palacios, 677 F.3d 234, 248 (4th Cir. 2012) (internal

quotation marks omitted). Substantial evidence is “evidence that a reasonable finder of

fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant’s guilt

beyond a reasonable doubt.”       Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).      Furthermore,



                                             2
“[d]eterminations of credibility are within the sole province of the jury and are not

susceptible to judicial review.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).

       “To establish a drug conspiracy under 21 U.S.C. § 846, the government must

prove that (1) the defendant entered into an agreement with one or more persons to

engage in conduct that violated 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1); (2) that the defendant had

knowledge of that conspiracy; and (3) that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily

participated in the conspiracy.” United States v. Howard, 773 F.3d 519, 525 (4th Cir.

2014) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). The government can prove the

existence of a conspiracy wholly through circumstantial evidence. Id. For a conviction

under § 841(a), the government must show that a defendant knowingly or intentionally

possessed a controlled substance with the intent to distribute it. United States v. Blue,

808 F.3d 226, 232 (4th Cir. 2015). For constructive possession, the defendant must have

had knowledge of the existence of the drugs, and the power to exercise dominion and

control over the drugs. Id.

       To demonstrate a Travel Act violation, the government must show (1) interstate or

foreign travel, (2) an intent to promote an unlawful activity, and (3) performance or

attempted performance of an unlawful act. United States v. Gallo, 782 F.2d 1191, 1194

(4th Cir. 1986). Finally, for a violation of § 843(b), the government must demonstrate

that a defendant used a telephone to facilitate the distribution of cocaine, and may



IV. Did the trial court err in allowing the AD DAMNUM clause to be amended at trial?

At trial plaintiff moved, over defendant's objection, *464 to increase the ad damnum from $1,300 to $1,900. Plaintiff's counsel explained that he had demanded the former amount without considering the additional $600 the bank had taken from plaintiff's account. There is no dispute that $1,900 is the amount actually owed on the note, and defendant's only objection is that he was surprised and prejudiced by this amendment. Defendant cites Phillips v Rolston, 376 Mich 264; 137 NW2d 158 (1965), in support of his argument. Defendant failed to note this Court's decision in Gibeault v City of Highland Park, 49 Mich App 736; 212 NW2d 818 (1973), affirmed, 391 Mich 814; 217 NW2d 99 (1974), where a post trial amendment of the ad damnum clause was allowed, and which criticized the rationale of Phillips. The Supreme Court's affirmance indicates that liberal amendments to ad damnum clauses will be sustained.
Defendant also cites DCR 118 as placing the burden on a moving party to prove no prejudice will result to the opposing party by amendments to conform with proofs. We need only note that the prejudice which must be disproved is that which the opposing party may experience "in maintaining his action or defense upon the merits". The amount of damages in this case does not go either to the ability to maintain the action or to the merits of the case.
Amendment of pleadings is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial judge, and the policy is to allow liberal amendment of pleadings. Ben P Fyke and Sons Inc v Gunter Co, 390 Mich 649; 213 NW2d 134 (1973); Bigelow v Walraven, 392 Mich 566; 221 NW2d 328 (1974). To reverse the trial court would require evidence of a clear abuse of discretion and none is found here.
*465 V. Did the trial court commit reversible error by incorrectly emphasizing plaintiff's position when summarizing the facts at the conclusion of trial?
DCR 516.7 states in part as follows:
"At the close of the evidence each party shall submit to the court a statement of the issues and his theory of the case as to each issue." From the record it appears defendant did not submit such a statement. The judge charged as to the theories of both sides and defendant objected then and now complains

          The government argues that plain error review should apply because Wyss did not
specifically identify the Confrontation Clause as the basis for his trial-court objection. We
need not decide this question because Wyss's argument fails even under the less
deferential standard of review.

                                  No. 12-30922

at 53-54 (Emphasis added). The relationship between qualification for one of the
standard hearsay exceptions and exemption from the Confrontation requirement
is not a casual one. Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U.S. 305, 129 S.Ct.
2527, 2539-2540, 174 L.Ed.2d 314 (2009). Hearsay law exempts business records
because businesses have a financial incentive to keep reliable records. See Fed.
Rule Evid. 803(6). The Sixth Amendment also generally admits business records
into evidence, but not because of their reliability under hearsay law. Business
records are admitted because - having been created for the administration of an
entity's affairs and not for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact at
trial - they are not weaker substitutes for live testimony. Melendez-Diaz, 129
S.Ct. at 2539-2540.
      The Crawford Court described a testimonial statement as "'[a] solemn
declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some
fact,'" a description which includes "statements that are made under
circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that
the statement would be available for use at a later trial.'" See Brown v. Epps,
686 F.3d 281, 286-87 (5th Cir. 2012). This Court must determine whether the
Sprint records are more akin to testimony or to an ordinary business record that
was not prepared for litigation purposes. See United States v. Martinez-Rios,
595 F.3d 581, 585-6 (5th Cir. 2010) .
3.    Discussion
      Wyss asserts that Sprint's IP address records are testimonial in nature
because they were produced by a representative from Sprint's legal compliance
department who did not personally retrieve the data, in response to a trial
subpoena. Wyss cites

or acts which provoke the cause of death may be negligent as well as intentional for

purposes of R.C. 2125.01.” Id.

      {¶50} There is no evidence in the instant case that the design of the parking lot

provoked Besancon’s actions. There is no evidence as to why Besancon drove up into

the pedestrian walkway, killing Civanna. Besancon said that he could not remember the

accident and merely testified that if he had been in his right mind, he would not have

been traveling 40-50 mph in front of the store. Contra to appellants’ argument, there is

no evidence that Wal-mart’s parking lot design created a “drag strip” which provoked the

accident. The evidence and photos of the site show numerous markings and signage
Holmes County App. Case No. 11CA002                                                 17


designed to warn drivers to slow down because they are traveling in an area where

pedestrians may be crossing, as indicated earlier in this opinion. Reasonable minds

could not conclude that appellee provoked Besancon’s wrongful act.

       {¶51} Appellants argue next that there are disputed facts as to whether appellee

was grossly negligent in the parking lot design and whether Besancon’s acts were an

intervening, superseding cause of Civanna’s death. These claims have been raised

and rejected earlier in this opinion.

       {¶52} Appellants argue there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether

Civanna was conscious following the accident. Appellants rely on the statement of Noel

Christian in his affidavit that Civanna survived and was conscious for up to a minute

after being struck. This evidence contradicts all other witness testimony at the scene

and Noel’s own earlier deposition testimony that he was not present when she was

struck but was in the back of the Wal-mart store and when he saw her she was not

moving or breathing.      However, we need not reach the issue of whether Civanna

retained consciousness as required to support a survivorship claim because we have

found summary judgment appropriate on the issues of both negligence and gross

negligence.

Carnation contends that the FOM regulations required the agency to inspect the entire plant for noise violations rather than to pick three random sites.2 It then argues that OSHA's failure to follow its own regulations denied Carnation due process.  Carnation relies on several cases including Vitarelli v. Seaton, 359 U.S. 535, 79 S.Ct. 968, 3 L.Ed.2d 1012 (1959); Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 74 S.Ct. 499, 98 L.Ed.2d 681 (1954); and United States v. Heffner, 420 F.2d 809 (4th Cir. 1969).


13
We do not find this argument persuasive.  The Accardi doctrine is not a constitutional one.  See, United States v. Caceres, 440 U.S. 741, 99 S.Ct. 1465, 59 L.Ed.2d 743 (1979); United States v. Calderon-Medina, 591 F.2d 529 (9th Cir. 1979), later app., United States v. Rangel-Gonzales, 617 F.2d 529 (9th Cir. 1980) (quoting from Mendez v. Immigration & Natur.  Service, 563 F.2d 956 (9th Cir. 1977)); see also, United States v. Sourapas, 515 F.2d 295, 300 (9th Cir. 1975) (noting that a suppression order for violation of IRS' regulations was a harsh weapon to use in the exercise of supervisory powers).  Because the doctrine is not a constitutional one, we can overrule the Secretary only by exercising our supervisory powers.3


14
We decline to exercise our supervisory powers in this case for several reasons.  First, it is not entirely clear that the regulations have the meaning which Carnation attributes to them.  The language does not give a clear mandate; and logic suggests that they cannot mean what Carnation says they mean all violations must be located and cited or the suit is dismissed.  The second reason why we decline to exercise our supervisory powers is that the deviation, if any, from the regulations was not prejudicial.4


15
Carnation would be prejudiced by the Secretary's random citations if the Secretary could, by those citations, force Carnation to remodel the plant piecemeal

Clause. The district court denied relief on the merits. Acting pro se, the
movant timely appealed. He did not move for a COA.
      Although the case initially was docketed as an appeal of the criminal
conviction, it was re-designated as an appeal from the denial of what was, in
effect, a 28 U.S.C. § 2255 motion. See Tolliver v. Dobre, 211 F. 3d 876, 877 (5th
Cir. 2000) (“Section 2255 is the primary means of collaterally attacking a
federal sentence.”); see also, e.g., United States v. Fisher, 372 F. App’x 526, 528
(5th Cir. 2010) (noting that where a federal prisoner’s motion “primarily seeks
to challenge collaterally the constitutionality of his conviction, it should be
construed, and considered, by the district court as a motion under 28 U.S.C.
§ 2255”). The movant then filed a motion in this court for a COA, which is
required to appeal the denial of relief under § 2255.             See 28 U.S.C.
§ 2253(c)(1)(B).
      Rule 11(a) of the Rules Governing § 2255 Proceedings requires the
district court to “issue or deny a certificate of appealability when it enters a
final order adverse to the applicant.” This requirement previously appeared
in Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 22(b). See FED. R. APP. P. 22(b) (2008);
Cardenas v. Thaler, 651 F.3d 442, 444 & n.1 (5th Cir. 2011). Under Rule 22,
“the absence of a prior determination by the district court on whether a COA
should issue posed a jurisdictional bar to this court’s consideration of whether
to grant or deny a COA.” Cardenas, 651 F.3d at 445 & n.3. We assume,
without deciding, that this jurisdictional requirement continues to apply under
Rule 11.

However, in a letter dated July 12, 1967, addressed to the company's adjuster, the Ohio Farmers' Claims Manager stated that an investigation of the underwriting file revealed that the following additional wording was applicable: "Except with respect to operations performed by independent contractors." The Claims Manager then went on to say: "Under these circumstances, therefore, I actually see no way that we ourselves can exclude coverage for our insured in this accident." We agree that in this situation, since the accident occurred away from the premises, during the course of operations performed by an independent contractor that Ohio Farmers owed coverage.
The Borough is the named insured in both policies and Officer Poninsky is clearly an omnibus insured under Erie's automobile insurance policy. His status under the Ohio Farmers general liability policy, however, is not quite as clear.
The Ohio Farmers' definition of "insured" is as follows:
"The unqualified word `insured' includes the named insured and also includes (1) under coverages B and D any executive officer, director or stockholder thereof while acting within the scope of his duties as such, and any organization or proprietor with respect to real estate management for the named insured, and if the named insured is a partnership, the unqualified word `insured' also includes any partner therein but only with respect to his liability as such . . ."
Since the policy is written with a municipality as the "insured", but the language in the standard form used here is more easily applied to business organizations, there is some difficulty in determining those who are `insureds'. However, we note that in the schedule of hazards attached to the policy, after a listing of various Borough activities, there is a listing "policeman" and a separate charge is made for this coverage.
In view of the question of the applicability of the form language to a municipality and the fact that a separate premium was charged for activities relating to "policeman", we think it a fair construction of the contract and the intention of the parties that Poninsky was also covered. Since Poninsky was alleged to be negligent in the course of his duties as a policeman and that the Borough specifically contracted for such coverage, it would be inconsisent with the general plan of protection provided to hold that the officer was excluded and thus personally liable over to the insurance company.
We thus have a situation where Poninsky and the Borough are covered by both the Erie and Ohio Farmers' policy.
Each policy contains a provision that in the event of "other

judgment.” Midland Asphalt Corp. v. United States, 489 U.S. 794, 798 (1989) (internal

quotation marks omitted). Pursuant to that rule, an appeal in a criminal case may usually

be taken only after the defendant has been convicted and sentenced. Id. Under the

collateral order doctrine, however, a limited number of district court orders are

immediately appealable, because they “finally determine claims of right separable from,

and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too

independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the

whole case is adjudicated.” Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 546
                                             2
(1949). Although Guevara raises several claims in this appeal, we may consider only

those that fall within this narrow exception to the final judgment rule.

       Guevara first argues that the district court was required to dismiss the indictment,

because to prosecute him for the conduct outlined therein would necessarily violate the

rule of specialty. Pursuant to that rule, an extradited defendant may be prosecuted only

on the charges for which the surrendering state granted extradition. See United States v.

Campbell, 300 F.3d 202, 210 (2d Cir. 2002).                Guevara maintains that, despite

prosecutors’ assurances to Dominican officials that he would be prosecuted for offenses

“completely different” from and “not related” to the acts for which he was prosecuted in

that country, the charges set out in the U.S. indictment are necessarily related to the 1,400

kilogram cocaine seizure that was at the center of the Dominican prosecution.

       Guevara’s rule-of-specialty claim does not come within the bounds of the

collateral order doctrine, and we therefore lack appellate jurisdiction over it. In United

States v. Levy, we observed that “unlike protections such as the Double Jeopardy Clause,

the doctrine of specialty does not guarantee a right not to be tried, but rather a right to be

protected from a court’s authority.” 947 F.2d 1032, 1034 (2d Cir. 1991). The rule of

specialty is thus a limitation on

Decree affirmed.
Mr. JUSTICE MAXWELL delivered the opinion of the court:
This is a direct appeal by three intervening petitioners from a decree of the circuit court of McDonough County in a proceeding filed by the McDonough County Orphanage, a corporation, hereinafter called the Orphanage, to dissolve and distribute its assets pursuant to sections 54 and 55 of the "Act to revise the law relating to Corporations not for pecuniary profit" approved July 17, 1943. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1953, chap. 32, par. 163a53, 163a54.) A part of the assets in controversy is real estate, thus a freehold is involved.
The complaint alleges that the Orphanage was organized in 1912 as a charitable corporation to care for, educate *233 and place in good homes dependent children of McDonough County and later elected to adopt the provisions of the cited statute; that since 1950, it has had no children in the home under its supervision and that its assets are subject to waste by continuing operations and prays dissolution and distribution of its assets by the court under the aforesaid statute. Its assets are alleged to be cash, bonds, real estate and a vested interest in certain real estate and personal property as provided in the eighth clause of the will of Hannah F. Wright held in trust by Sarah Burnhart during the lifetime of Albanah R. Van Osdell as construed by the circuit court of McDonough County by decree entered on June 10, 1938.

 JOEL CASTON,

         Plaintiff,
                v.                                         Civil Action No. 08-1656 (JDB)
 JAMES BUTLER, et al.,

         Defendants.



                                  MEMORANDUM OPINION

       Plaintiff, a federal prisoner, brought this action against James Q. Butler, an attorney and

the managing partner of law firm to which plaintiff paid a retainer for legal representation on a

post-conviction in his criminal case. See Caston v. Butler, 629 F. Supp. 2d 20 (D.D.C. 2009).

On December 4, 2009, the Court granted plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment and entered a

judgment in his favor for $5,000. Cason v. Butler, No. 08-1656, 2009 WL 4730753, at *1

(D.D.C. Dec. 4, 2009). On June 22, 2010, the Court denied plaintiff’s demand for punitive

damages, awarded pre-judgment interest, and determined that there may be a basis for a further

award of compensatory damages. Caston v. Butler, No. 08-1656, 2010 WL 2505591, at *2

(D.D.C. June 22, 2010). Given plaintiff’s pro se status, the Court afforded plaintiff an

opportunity to submit specific documentation of any actual expenditures which would be

recoverable as additional compensatory damages. See id.

       Plaintiff represents that he unable to provide “specific documentation (bills, invoices,

receipts, etc.) of any actual expenditures incurred in attempting to hire another attorney.” Pl.’s

Resp. to Order of the Court [Dkt. #37]. Defendant Butler has not filed an opposition or any other

response to plaintiff’s submission. It appears, then, that all issues presented in this case have

been resolved, and this civil action will be dismissed. The total judgment in favor of plaintiff as

reflected in the Court’s prior orders will remain at $5,140.30.

       An Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.

          Defendant is correct that Mr. Kennedy’s statutory claim for Fall 2004 benefits is
properly before the court. Accordingly, the court acknowledges its misstatement, in its ruling
concerning the scope of the administrative record, that “[t]he only remaining claim before the
court is Mr. Kennedy’s statutory claim . . . for the Fall 2006 and Spring 2007 semesters,”

course” consists of “NROTC students” in their first and second years of the program, whereas
the “advanced course” consists of “NROTC students” in their third and fourth years of the
program. Id. at 920 (CNETINST 1533.12G ¶ 301(j)). In other words, “[s]tudents must be
participating in regularly scheduled activities . . . to receive benefits.” Id. at 1001 (CNETINST
1533.12G ¶ 601(d)); see also id. at 1006 (CNETINST 1533.12G ¶ 610(a)) (indicating that
scholarship funds are subject to the general limitations set forth in Article 601 of CNETINST
1533.12G). Specifically, scholarship assistance “is authorized only while receiving subsistence
payments,” id. at 1006 (CNETINST 1533.12G ¶ 610(a)), entitlement to which “begins on the
day appointed as Midshipman,” id. at 1002 (CNETINST 1533.12G ¶ 602(a)(1)). Since the
applicable regulations unequivocally provide that students may receive NROTC scholarship
benefits only while enrolled in the NROTC program, an interpretation that benefits are
retroactively available for semesters prior to enrollment is unreasonable. See Rosenberg v.
Peake, 296 F. App’x 53, 55 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (unpublished per curiam decision) (“Indeed, a

"The Court: Well, I'm inclined to try to be equitable again. I probably might be reversed, but it seems to me as though when you pay in $7,200, on a property settlement agreement the amount of which is $8,000, and there is not a substantial forfeiture, but a forfeiture over a very short period of time  it would have to be, because here we are in September, and the petition is before us, and all the money is in the friend of the court's office. I elect to follow the course of equity and to disregard the strict letter of the agreement. I deny the petition. I'm well aware of all the opinions cited by counsel for the plaintiff, I have read all of them previously in other cases, but my conscience tells me that I must again decide on the side of equity. I think it would be inequitable and unconscionable to hold otherwise, and in a situation of this kind my conscience comes first in controlling my decision, and that's my decision."
*201 It is unfortunately not clear from the record before us just how late the defendant was with his belated payment. Apparently, however, it was but a matter of a few days past the permissible 30 days, as the defendant's cross petition states "That the defendant was more than 30 days late in the June 4, 1958 instalment, as alleged in plaintiff's petition, but that the same was paid in just over 30 days after due and that said payment was next to the last payment due the plaintiff," and this statement nowhere appears to be disputed by the plaintiff. We also note that nowhere in her petition does the plaintiff on her part say what she proposes to do with the $7,200 already paid her by defendant under the $8,000 settlement; there is no offer or proffer of any refund; and we can only conclude that she means, if she can, along with our co-operation, to keep the money and retain a share in the land as well.
Plaintiff insists that the terms of a property settlement in a divorce decree are not subject to later modification, short of a showing of fraud (citing Roddy v. Roddy, 312 Mich 66, and numerous other cases, of which more presently), which fraud this cross-petitioning defendant concededly has neither alleged nor proved. Appellant urges that this rule should all the more apply when, as here, the provisions in question were the result of careful negotiations between the parties and their attorneys, and the terms approved

methamphetamine laboratories, six handguns, and a rifle,” under an implied assurance of

confidentiality), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1094 (1998). The Court concludes that the DEA properly

withheld the identities of and information provided by the confidential sources under Exemption

7(D).


                                        d. Exemption 7(F)

               Exemption 7(F) protects from disclosure information contained in law

enforcement records that “could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of

any individual.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(F). The Court has reviewed the Vaughn Index, see



                                                20
Wassom Decl, Ex. K, and finds that the DEA relies on Exemption 7(F) in conjunction with

Exemption 7(C) with respect to the same information. Because the Court already has concluded

that the same information properly was withheld under either Exemption 7(C), there is no need

also to consider the applicability of Exemption 7(F) with respect to this information. See Simon

v. Dep’t of Justice, 980 F.2d at 785.


                                        D. Segregability

               If a record contains information that is exempt from disclosure, any reasonably

segregable information must be released after deleting the exempt portions, unless the non-

exempt portions are inextricably intertwined with exempt portions. 5 U.S.C. § 552(b); see

Trans-Pacific Policing Agreement v. United States Customs Serv., 177 F.3d 1022 (D.C. Cir.

1999). The court errs if it “simply approve[s] the withholding of an entire document without

entering a finding on segregability, or the lack thereof.” Powell v. United States Bureau of

Prisons, 927 F.2d 1239, 1242 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (quoting Church of Scientology of Cal. v.

Here, the trial court did not make any findings regarding the existence of, or the deputy's compliance with, standardized criteria in conducting the inventory search of Kilburn's truck. Although the deputy testified that it was standard Sheriff's Office policy to conduct an inventory search whenever a vehicle was towed, he also testified that there were no standardized criteria for performing such a search. Additionally, the state did not present any evidence that it was standard Sheriff's Office policy to open closed containers found during the search, such as the pill bottle in Kilburn's truck where the drugs were found. Accordingly, under these circumstances, the trial court erred in denying Kilburn's motion to suppress the drugs found in his truck. See Wells, 539 So.2d at 469 (reversing denial of motion to suppress based upon the absence of a standardized policy requiring the opening of closed containers found during a legitimate inventory search); Beezley v. State, 863 So.2d 386 *628 (Fla. 2d DCA 2003) (reversing and remanding for discharge because trial court should have granted dispositive motion to suppress where no indication that police conducted inventory search according to standardized criteria); Patty v. State, 768 So.2d 1126 (Fla. 2d DCA 2000) (directing granting of motion to suppress where state failed to present evidence of standardized criteria used in inventory search); Roberson v. State, 566 So.2d 561 (Fla. 1st DCA 1990) (holding that search of closed can was illegal where evidence did not show that it was standard procedure to open closed containers).
Based upon the foregoing, we reverse the trial court's order denying Kilburn's second motion to suppress, and because that motion was dispositive of the possession of marijuana and possession of alprazolam offenses, we remand with directions that Kilburn be discharged on those offenses. In all other respects, Kilburn's judgment and sentence is affirmed.

MEMORANDUM ORDER
JOHN GARRETT PENN, District Judge.
On March 7, 1991, the Grand Jury returned an indictment charging the defendants with unlawful possession of a firearm with an obliterated or altered serial number, 18 U.S.C. § 922(k), unlawful possession of a firearm not registered in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record, 26 U.S.C. § 5861(d), and unlawful possession of a firearm not identified by serial number, 26 U.S.C. § 5861(i).[1] On *2 July 16, 1991, the Grand Jury returned a superseding indictment purportedly correcting Count 1, however, the new indictment also contained an error. The Court began the motions hearing on July 18, 1991. On July 18, 1991, the Grand Jury returned a second superseding indictment that was filed in open court. The defendants were arraigned on the July 18th superseding indictment on July 19, 1991.
The case is now before the Court on the McNab's Motion To Suppress Statements and Motion To Suppress Evidence, and Allen's Motion To Suppress Statement and Motion to Suppress Evidence. A hearing was held on July 18 and 19, 1991. After giving careful consideration to the motions and the opposition thereto, together with the record in this case, the Court concludes that Allen's motion to suppress evidence should be granted and all other motions should be denied.

I
Briefly, the facts as found by the Court are as follows: On February 6, 1991, officers of the Metropolitan Police Department received a report of "suspicious" activity relating to two cars parked in the area of the 1400 block of Whittier Place, N.W., in the District of Columbia. The citizen making the call thought that the occupants of the cars were selling drugs. The radio run referred to a "red sports car" and a "blue" car. Officer Dixon and his rookie partner, Officer Rosenburg, responded to the area and while proceeding east on Whittier Place observed a red two door Chevette with the defendants seated inside. The officers also observed an empty red Mazda sports car parked diagonally across the street from the Chevette. Apparently they did not observe the blue car. The officers approached from the rear and stopped approximately five feet behind the Chevette. Both officers stepped out and Dixon approached the Chevette on the driver's side while Rosenburg approached on the passenger side. Up to this time the

*217 VII.

Defendant Was Improperly Convicted of Three Separate Counts of Murder
(1) Defendant claims he was improperly convicted of three separate counts of murder and that convictions on two of the three counts must be reversed. The People concede defendant can only stand convicted of one count of murder for his killing of Trujillo. We accept the People's concession.
(2) Section 954 provides, in pertinent part, that "[a]n accusatory pleading may charge two or more different offenses connected together in their commission, or different statements of the same offense ... under separate counts .... The prosecution is not required to elect between the different offenses or counts set forth in the accusatory pleading, but the defendant may be convicted of any number of the offenses charged...." (Italics added.) "Thus multiple charges and multiple convictions can be based on a single criminal act, if the charges allege separate offenses." (People v. Muhammad (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 484, 490 [68 Cal.Rptr.3d 695]; see People v. Ryan (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 360, 368-369 [41 Cal.Rptr.3d 277].) Here, the three counts charged a single offense: murder. (§ 187, subd. (a).) The three counts simply alleged alternative theories of the offense.
The People suggest the appropriate remedy for this error is to consolidate the judgment to reflect one count of murder with two special circumstances and a finding of malice. The People note that in similar circumstances involving duplicative convictions, other courts have ordered that multiple counts be consolidated into a single judgment. (People v. Scott (1944) 24 Cal.2d 774, 777 [151 P.2d 517] (Scott) [ordered three counts of rape based on single act of intercourse consolidated into single judgment]; People v. Craig (1941) 17 Cal.2d 453, 459 [110 P.2d 403] [consolidating judgments and modifying the single judgment to state defendant was convicted of rape as charged in two counts]; People v. Brown (1948) 87 Cal.App.2d 281, 287 [196 P.2d 936] (Brown) [consolidating convictions for rape and a lesser included offense of assault with intent to commit rape].)
Defendant argues against consolidation. He distinguishes Scott, supra, 24 Cal.2d 774 and Brown, supra, 87 Cal.App.

ISSUES
There are two issues presented for our review. The first is whether the rescission by the City of Oakdale of Ordinance # 1248 rendered moot the issue as to its validity and reasonableness. The second issue is whether the city was required to refrain from introducing, within a year, another annexation ordinance of practically the same area as the prior ordinance which was rescinded.

1.
To rescind is by dictionary definition to take back, to make void. The Louisiana Supreme Court in City of New Orleans v. Lakowsky, 158 La. 70, 103 So. 513 (1925), held that "the repeal of an act or ordinance is a complete bar to further proceedings." Ordinance # 1248, and all disputes arising out of it, ceased to exist when it was rescinded. Its reasonableness is now moot, and courts do not decide moot questions. Caldwell v. Planning Commission of Calcasieu Parish, 425 So.2d 262 (La.App. 3rd Cir.1982), writ denied, 430 So.2d 95 (La. 1983). The ruling of the trial court regarding the viability of issues arising under Ordinance # 1248 was correct.

2.
Citing R.S. 33:174, the appellants urge that the city should be prohibited for one year from proposing any new annexation ordinance which would encompass practically the same area as that described in Ordinance # 1248.
A suit to contest the reasonableness (as opposed to the violation of procedural requirements) of a proposed extension of corporate limits is provided by R.S. 33:174. This section provides that in such a suit, "The question shall be whether the proposed extension is reasonable". The statute declares that if it is adjudged reasonable, the ordinance shall go into effect 10 days after the judgment is rendered and signed, unless a suspensive appeal is taken. If the ordinance is adjudged unreasonable, the following sanction is made applicable:
"If the proposed extension is adjudged unreasonable the ordinance shall be vacated and the proposed extension shall be denied, and no ordinances proposing practically the same extension shall be introduced for one year thereafter."
In his reasons for judgment, the trial judge stated that since Ordinance # 1248 had not been adjudged unreasonable, the City of Oakdale would not be prevented from proposing an annexation ordinance incorporating practically the same area. This was a correct decision. The moratorium on new annexation proposals imposed by R.S. 33

"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing statement of the rule, a State agent shall not be immune from civil liability in his or her personal capacity
"(1) when the Constitution or laws of the United States, or the Constitution of this State, or laws, rules, or regulations of this State enacted or promulgated for the purpose of regulating the activities of a governmental agency require otherwise; or
"(2) when the State agent acts willfully, maliciously, fraudulently, in bad faith, beyond his or her authority, or under a mistaken interpretation of the law."
792 So.2d at 405 (some emphasis added). In Ex parte Butts, 775 So.2d 173 (Ala. 2000), a majority of this Court adopted the Cranman restatement of the rule governing State-agent immunity.
"We have established a `burden-shifting' process when a party raises the defense of State-agent immunity. Ex parte Wood, 852 So.2d 705 (Ala.2002). In order to claim State-agent immunity, the [defendants] bear the burden of demonstrating that [the plaintiff's] claims arise from a function that would entitle them to immunity. Wood, 852 So.2d at 709; Ryan v. Hayes, 831 So.2d 21 (Ala.2002). If the [defendants] make such a showing, the burden then shifts to [the plaintiff], who, in order to deny the [defendants] immunity from suit, must establish that the [defendants] acted willfully, maliciously, fraudulently, in bad faith, or beyond their authority. Wood, 852 So.2d at 709; Ex parte Davis, 721 So.2d 685, 689 (Ala.1998). A State agent acts beyond authority and is therefore not immune when he or she `fail[s] to discharge duties pursuant to detailed rules or regulations, such as those stated on a checklist.' Ex parte Butts, 775 So.2d 173, 178 (Ala.2000)."
Giambrone v. Douglas, 874 So.2d 1046, 1052 (Ala.2003).
This Court addressed a similar issue in Ex parte Nall, 879 So.2d 541 (Ala.2003). In Nall, a baseball hit by a high school baseball coach during a practice drill struck a player in the head. The player's parents sued the baseball coach, alleging

MEMORANDUM AND ORDER
Appeal from an order of the Supreme Court (Mackey, J.), entered June 2, 2017 in Albany County, which, among other things, in a combined proceeding pursuant to Election Law § 16-114 and action for declaratory judgment, granted certain respondents' motions to dismiss the petition/complaint.
Petitioners, five qualified voters who reside within the 9th Assembly District, commenced this combined action and proceeding on May 16, 2017, one week prior to a May 23, [*2]2017 special election for the public office of Member of the Assembly for the 9th Assembly District. Respondent Christine Pellegrino was a candidate for that office, and respondents New Yorkers for a Brighter Future (hereinafter NYBF), Teachers for Christine (hereinafter TFC) and Voice of Teachers for Education/Committee on Political Education of the New York State United Teachers (hereinafter VOTE/COPE) are alleged to have supported Pellegrino's candidacy and ultimate election. Petitioners allege that NYBF, acting as a political action committee or an independent expenditure committee (see

Congress may establish jurisdiction in United States courts over individuals who commit the offense of
  hijacking outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.
In most cases, state and local law enforcement officers would be authorized to make arrests for
   violations of the proposed aircraft piracy legislation, either because hijacking airplanes would also
   violate state law, or because federal law permits federal enforcement officers to delegate arrest
   authority to state and local law enforcement officers and state law permits state and local law
   enforcement officers to accept delegated arrest authority.

                           CRIMINAL DIVISION

   This is in response to your request for the views of the Office of Legal Counsel
on questions concerning the constitutionality and legality of certain provisions in
proposed legislation (S. 39 and H.R. 3858, 93d Cong.) that would establish a
program to prevent aircraft piracy. The questions, which were raised during the
course of hearings before the Subcommittee on Transportation and Aeronautics of
the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, are the following:

I. Federal Jurisdiction

   Whether Congress has the power to establish federal jurisdiction over individu-
als who commit the offense of hijacking outside the territorial jurisdiction of the
United States in the event that the government does not choose to extradite the
individual?

II. Arrest Authority of Local Law Enforcement Officers and Private Security
Personnel

   A. Whether local law enforcement officers are authorized to arrest for viola-
tions of federal law?
   B. Whether the United States may delegate arrest authority to local law en-
forcement officers or private security personnel?
   C. Whether private security personnel are authorized to arrest for violations of
federal or local laws?
   D. Whether the United States can deputize private personnel as Deputy United
States Marshals?

   The constitutional aspects and any relevant statutory authority on these ques-
tions will be discussed seriatim.

sation benefits, has not responded to the Secretary’s mo-
tion.

    In a September 13, 2011 decision of the Board of Vet-
erans Appeals (Board), Mr. Perez was denied entitlement
to service connection for a back disorder. On February 13,
2012, 153 days after the issuance of the Board’s decision,
he filed a notice of appeal with the Untied States Court of
Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans Court) seeking
review of that decision. In light of the lateness of the
appeal, the Veterans Court ordered Mr. Perez to show
cause why his case should not be dismissed for lack of
jurisdiction, but he failed to respond.

     In its June 26, 2012 decision dismissing the appeal, the
Veterans Court acknowledged that the 120–day filing
period for filing an appeal is subject to equitable tolling.
However, because Mr. Perez failed to give any reason as to
why his appeal should not be dismissed, the Veterans
Court held that there was no basis to satisfy the requisites
for justifying equitable tolling of the 120-day appeal period.
 This appeal followed.

    Our jurisdiction to review decisions of the Veterans
Court is limited by statute. Guillory v. Shinseki, 603 F.3d
981, 986 (Fed. Cir. 2010). We have jurisdiction over “all
relevant questions of law, including interpreting constitu-
tional and statutory provisions.” 38 U.S.C. § 7292(d)(1).
We lack jurisdiction, however

      At the time of their divorce, the Ebels owned as tenants in common a nine-

hole golf course, a driving range, an adjoining house, and three nearby building

lots (“Property”). Since 1987 the Property has been managed by a receiver

pending final resolution of the marital property, and earnings derived from the

operation of the Property were divided 50/50 between the parties. In 1990, and

before a final resolution of the Property could be made, Mr. Ebel filed for

bankruptcy. Colorado courts have twice considered the division of the Property

and twice awarded the former Mrs. Ebel all the Property, most recently in

December 1999. In June 1996, the former Mrs. Ebel reached a settlement

agreement with the trustee in Mr. Ebel’s bankruptcy case that would end litigation

regarding any claims that Mr. Ebel’s estate might have on the Property or its

proceeds. In April 2004, the bankruptcy court approved the settlement agreement

and in March 2005, the district court affirmed the agreement.

      Mr. Ebel makes three challenges to the bankruptcy court’s approval of the

settlement, each of which he made to the district court. First, Mr. Ebel claims

that the settlement agreement is invalid because his share of the proceeds from the

Property following his 1990 bankruptcy filing does not belong to the estate under

11 U.S.C. § 541(a)(6). Second, Mr. Ebel argues that the bankruptcy court did not

follow Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9019. And finally, Mr. Ebel argues

that the bankruptcy court did not make the findings required by the rules of civil

and bankruptcy procedure to accept a settlement agreement. The district court

thoroughly addressed and rejected each of these arguments.

      Mr. Ebel’s work on the Property did not exempt proceeds from the Property

from the bankruptcy estate. Section 541(a)(6) provides that an estate does not

include “earnings from services performed by an individual debtor after the

commencement of the case.” The district court noted two problems with Mr.

Ebel’s argument that his share of proceeds from the Property is exempt from the

estate. First, “it does not appear that [Mr. Ebel] adequately raised this issue

SCHROEDER, J.:
This is a wrongful death action brought by the parents of two young boys who drowned in a sand pit within the city limits of Wichita, Kansas. The case was tried to a jury on the theory of attractive nuisance and a verdict returned for the plaintiffs in the total sum of $52,024.02. From the judgment thereon appeal has been duly perfected by the defendants assigning various trial errors.
Among the trial errors asserted, the appellants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support a verdict on the theory of attractive nuisance.
The evidence discloses that Dean L. Bartlett, four years old, and Vernon A. (Buddy) Elliott, Jr., five years old, were playmates and resided near each other in the area of Southwest Wichita. The Bartletts were the parents of four other children under ten years of age, and the Elliotts had one other child, a three year old daughter. The Bartletts moved into the neighborhood in August, 1964, and the Elliotts in July of the same year. Both families were buying their homes which were situated in the 4500 block on South Charles Street

PER CURIAM
      Defendant, James Todd, appeals from the revised sentence imposed on his

trial convictions for conspiracy to distribute CDS, hindering his own

apprehension, and disturbing/desecrating the remains of a gunshot victim. This

is not the first time we have considered the sentence defendant received for these

crimes. In defendant's initial appeal, we vacated his conviction for unlawful

possession of a weapon, affirmed his convictions for conspiracy, hindering, and

desecration, and ordered a new sentencing proceeding so that the trial judge

could explain the reasons for imposing the maximum sentences on the three

remaining convictions.

      In our initial unreported opinion, we found no reason to disturb the trial

court's imposition of consecutive sentences. State v. Todd, No. A-0021-13

(App. Div. Jan. 10, 2018) (slip op. at 16). See generally State v. Yarbough, 100

N.J. 627, 643–44 (1985) (explaining factors for imposing consecutive

sentences). We also concluded that the trial judge adequately explained his

findings regarding the aggravating sentencing factors. Todd, slip op. at 16.

However, we held the trial court at the initial sentencing proceeding did not

specifically explain why it imposed the maximum sentences on the convictions

for the third-degree crime of hindering apprehension and the second-degree

crime of desecrating human remains

DISCUSSION
Turning to the substantive issues first, we view the case as primarily one of applying the clear, unambiguous and unfettered language of section 1156.7, subdivision (c), which, to repeat, provides:
*371 "(c) Upon the filing with the board by an employee or group of employees of a petition signed by 30 percent or more of the agricultural employees in a bargaining unit represented by a certified labor organization which is a party to a valid collective-bargaining agreement, requesting that such labor organization be decertified, the board shall conduct an election by secret ballot pursuant to the applicable provisions of this chapter, and shall certify the results to such labor organization and employer.
"However, such a petition shall not be deemed timely unless it is filed during the year preceding the expiration of a collective-bargaining agreement which would otherwise bar the holding of an election, and when the number of agricultural employees is not less than 50 percent of the employer's peak agricultural employment for the current calendar year." (Italics added.)
Subdivision (b) of section 1156.7 (fn. 2, ante) establishes that an existing collective bargaining agreement shall bar a petition for election among the employees for so much of the term of the agreement as does not exceed three years. In labor law jargon this is referred to as a contract bar. It is to be noted that neither this section nor any other provision of the ALRA prohibits a one-year contract nor prescribes any other term for a collective bargaining agreement. It simply states that a contract for longer than three years will not act as a contract bar for a period in excess of that time. It does not pretend to prohibit a contract for any shorter period.
Subdivision (c) of section 1156.7 (see fn. 2, ante) creates an exception to this contract bar by providing that when 30 percent of the employees in the bargaining unit under the particular contract sign a petition requesting that the labor organization be decertified the ALRB shall direct an election to be held. The crucial language as to timing of a decertification petition specifically states that "such a petition shall not be deemed timely unless it is filed during the year preceding the expiration of a collective-bargaining agreement which would otherwise bar the holding of an election. ..." (Italics added.)
This language on its face explicitly permits a decertification petition to be filed at any time during the term of a one-year contract and

The record in the present case discloses that Judge Martin on 9 August 1971 proceeded exactly as this Court subsequently directed the Superior Court to do in Atkinson, Hill, Roseboro, Sanders, Williams, and Atkinson. Notice was issued by Judge Martin on 30 July 1971 to counsel of record for defendant Childs that on 9 August 1971, ten days from the date of the notice, further proceedings would be conducted in accordance with the mandate of the Supreme Court of the United States. On 9 August 1971 defendant, represented by counsel James E. Ferguson, II, was present in Buncombe Superior Court. While present in open court and represented by counsel, Judge Martin sentenced defendant to life imprisonment in each case pursuant to the mandate of the Supreme Court of the United States, based upon the verdicts of guilty of rape and first degree burglary returned by the jury at defendant's trial at the November 1965 Criminal Session of Buncombe Superior Court.
In the imposition of these judgments, after notice and hearing, and in accordance with the mandate of the Supreme Court of the United States, we find no error.
No error.

ORDER

2
Stanley Boswell, a pro se Michigan prisoner, moves for the appointment of counsel and appeals the district court's dismissal of his civil rights complaint filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983.  This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 9(a), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.  Upon examination of the record and the briefs, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed.  Fed.R.App.P. 34(a).


3
Seeking monetary relief, Boswell sued two state officials at the Huron Valley Men's prison alleging that while he was confined in segregation they violated his eighth amendment rights and a prison policy directive by not allowing him any out-of-cell movement (yard time).  Boswell was on loss-of-privileges status because of six major misconduct charges.  Defendants filed a motion to dismiss and plaintiff filed a response.  In a comprehensive report, the magistrate construed defendants' motion as one for summary judgment and recommended the motion be granted, finding that Miller had no personal involvement in the alleged deprivation, and that Myers did not violate Boswell's rights because the yard time restrictions were reasonable and in accord with prison regulations given the nature of Boswell's misconduct record.  Upon de novo review, the district court adopted the magistrate's recommendation and granted the defendants summary judgment, thereby dismissing the complaint.


4
Boswell did not file specific objections to the magistrate's report as required by United States v. Walters, 638 F.2d 947, 949-50 (6th Cir.1981).  He has therefore waived his right to appeal.


5
Accordingly, the motion for counsel is denied and the district court

                           SUMMARY*


                       Environmental Law

   The panel affirmed in part and reversed in part the district
court’s summary judgment in favor of United States agencies
and officials in an action challenging the Bureau of Land
Management’s management of grazing within the Upper
Missouri River Breaks National Monument in Montana.

    The panel held that BL

conclusion that the Court did not intend to alter the typical summary judgment requirements by
                                                 9


declaring a bright-line rule that vicarious liability claims must always go to a jury in the context

of a broker-agent relationship, even when there is no genuine issue of material fact as to the

broker’s vicarious liability. In Osborne, the Supreme Court recognized, as it did in Auer, that

scope of employment generally is a question of fact. Osborne, 63 Ohio St.3d at 330. However,

the Court explained that “scope of employment becomes a question of law” when “reasonable

minds can come to but one conclusion * * * regarding scope of employment.” Id.

       {¶26} Relying on Byrd, another of the Supreme Court’s prior decisions, the Auer Court

specified the type of evidence necessary to establish that a tortious act was committed within the

scope of employment. When (as here) an intentional tort is alleged, a determination that the

conduct was within the scope of employment requires evidence that the employee’s conduct

“’giving rise to the tort’” was “’calculated to facilitate or promote the business for which the

servant was employed * * *.’” Auer, 140 Ohio St.3d 276, 2014-Ohio-3632 at ¶ 22, quoting

Byrd, 57 Ohio St.3d at 58. “[A]n employer is not liable for independent self-serving acts of his

employees which in no way facilitate or promote his business.” Byrd at 59. “[I]f an employee’s

actions are self-serving or have no relationship to the employer’s business, then the conduct is

‘manifestly outside the scope of employment’ * * *.” Theobald v. University of Cincinnati, 111

Ohio St.3d 541, 2006-Ohio-6208, ¶ 28, quoting R.C. 9.86.

       {¶27} Here, CBH Realty presented evidence that Gerbec did not intend for her property

management activities for Carter to “facilitate or promote” CBH Realty’s real estate business.

See Byrd at 59. Gerbec signed an agreement with CBH Realty that she would not perform

property management functions on behalf of, or in the

        On November 5, 2010, petitioners submitted the report of Dr. Chone Ken Chen, a
physician who practices pediatric neurology at New York University Downtown Hospital and at
the Chang Comprehensive Health Center. On January 14, 2011, respondent filed a responsive
expert report from Dr. Russell Snyder. Petitioners filed a supplemental report from Dr. Chen on
March 28, 2011. During a status conference held on April 25, 2011, the parties indicated that
they were ready to proceed to hearing.

         A hearing was held on October 24, 2011, in New York City. Dr. Chen and Dr. Snyder
provided in-person testimony at the hearing. Each party submitted prehearing and posthearing
briefs. On November 13, 202, the undersigned issued a decision denying compensation, but
noted that Mr. Christiansen, acting pro se, handled this case with diligence and competence, and
that “it is extremely unlikely that a licensed attorney could have achieved a different result for
W.C.” Decision, 2012 WL 6766650, at *16.

        Even though compensation was denied, a petitioner who brings a petition in good faith
and who has a reasonable basis for the petition may be awarded attorneys’ fees and costs. See 42
U.S.C. § 300aa–15(e)(1).1 Here, the petitioners, acting pro se, gathered and filed medical
records, participated in numerous status conferences, obtained an expert witness to testify on
their behalf, produced two substantial briefs, and argued their case at a hearing. Thus, because
petitioners acted in good faith and because there was a reasonable basis for proceeding,
petitioners are eligible for reimbursement of costs. Respondent does not contend that petitioners
failed to satisfy these criteria.

        Petitioners seek a total of $4,496.80 in costs incurred while pursuing this claim, to which
respondent has no objection. After reviewing the request, the court awards a check made
payable to petitioners in the amount of $4,496.80 for litigation costs. The court thanks the
parties for their cooperative efforts in resolving this matter.

          The Clerk shall enter judgment accordingly.2

          IT IS SO ORDERED.

  Pursuant to

        In August 2000, Andrew Matthews filed a petition to dissolve the LLC. The court granted
the petition to dissolve the LLC and, instead of liquidating the assets and liabilities, ordered a sale
of the LLC by auction limiting the bidders to the two brothers. Eddie Matthews’ bid of $312,500
was the highest bid, thus he purchased the LLC. The successful auction, however, did not resolve
all issues between the brothers. It merely provided an opportunity for yet another dispute.

        The new dispute arose when the parties submitted their proposed orders to confirm the sale
of the LLC. The proposed order submitted by Andrew Matthews provided that the LLC’s liabilities
included the indebtedness owing on the promissory note while Eddie Matthews submitted an order
which provided that the brothers, not the LLC, were each liable for one-half of the outstanding
indebtedness owing on the note. The order submitted by Andrew Matthews was entered. It provided
in pertinent part that, “The business entity known as Crossroads Market, LLC, is hereby sold to
defendant E. E. Matthews III and all of the plaintiff’s right, title, and interest in and to said LLC,
being all of his 50% membership interest in and to said company, is hereby divested from plaintiff
[Andrew Matthews] upon completed payment of the purchase price as indicated below [$312,500].”
The order also provided that, “[T]he successful bidder, E.E. [Eddie] Matthews III, must continue to
pay all obligations established by the parties during the time they jointly operated the venture known
as Crossroad Market, LLC, which would include the total payment of the outstanding promissory
note at issue.” However, Eddie Matthews filed a motion to amend the order to delete all findings
of fact and conclusions of law regarding the obligations of the LLC under any note, property
mortgage or security deed related to the realty. He contended that the issue was not properly before
the court. Following yet another hearing, the trial court granted Eddie Matthews’ motion and set for



         1
           W hether or not the LLC assumed the liability on the note does not relieve the brothers of their individual
liability on the note because the holder of the note, originally the parents, has not released either brother from liability
on the note. Thus, the question is whether the LLC is additionally liable on the note. The current holder of the note is

Similarly, in Lewis v. Fowler, supra, the Court held that the withholding of funds from the plaintiff's wages pursuant to a garnishment would not support a conversion action in a situation where the funds had not been paid to the garnishor. In Covington v. *1387 Exxon Co. U.S.A., supra, the Court held that a conversion action would not lie where escrow funds had been commingled and deposited in numerous banks nationwide. In Johnson v. Life Ins. Co. of Alabama, 581 So.2d 438, 443 (Ala.1991), the Court held that an action would not lie for the alleged conversion of life insurance premiums paid by the plaintiffs, because "there was no specific, identifiable coin or bill [and no] evidence that the money had been placed into a separate account." In Greene County Bd. of Educ. v. Bailey, 586 So.2d 893, 899-90 (Ala.1991), the Court reversed a Rule 12(b)(6), Ala.R.Civ.P., dismissal of an action because "The allegations of the complaint suggest that the plaintiff may be able to prove that the defendants... converted to their own use funds that had been specifically deposited in the `[Paramount High School] lunchroom account' to pay for the high school's breakfast and lunch programs."
In this case, there is no evidence of money placed in an account at all, much less money placed in a specific account for the benefit of Tunstall. According to the evidence, Green Tree maintained a zero balance in its account and at the end of each day would borrow against its line of credit the amount needed to pay the checks presented that day. It wrote a check to Graves for $1200, but it never delivered the check and never deposited any money into an account to pay it. Tunstall does not argue that Green Tree converted the check itself; aside from any other impediments to such a claim, we do not see how Tunstall could argue that he had title to, or an immediate right to possession of, a check made payable to Graves.
Green Tree became a creditor of Tunstall, whether through its initial approval of the loan or through its purchase of the installment sales contract from Graves. Although it assigned a number to Tunstall's loan, it did not set aside funds to an account with this number. Any funds it held that might be used to fund this loan or to pay for the air condition

I. BACKGROUND
On April 1, 1997, Paul Green ("Green"), predecessor in interest to PG 1044, entered into a ten-year agreement for de Nails, LLC, to rent the second floor of 1044 Madison Avenue in Manhattan (the "Premises"). Trial transcript ("Tr.") at 9; Plaintiff's Trial Exhibit ("PX") 1 (Lease Agreement, dated April 1, 1997, hereinafter also referred to as "Lease"). The Lease included an exhibit listing certain salon-related items. According to the Lease:
Upon the expiration or other termination of the term of this Lease, Tenant shall quit and surrender to Owner the demised premises, broom clean, in good order and condition except fixtures listed on Exhibit 1.
PX 1 at ¶ 22. The Lease also provided that:
In addition to the payment of rent and additional rent provided for in this Lease, Tenant shall pay the Landlord at the signing of Lease the sum of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) in consideration of the right to use during the term of this Lease equipment as per the list of equipment attached as Exhibit 1.
Id. The Lease set the base monthly rental as $8,333 for the first three years, $9,167 for the following four years, and $10,083 until March 31, 2007. Id. The Lease was amended on June 30, 1998, to name Sirene One as the tenant, and included a limited guaranty establishing Karen Wu ("Wu") as guarantor for Sirene One. Tr. at 11, 29-30; PX 2. In relevant part, Wu guaranteed to Green
the full payment, performance and observance of all agreements to be performed and observed by Tenant in the attached lease, including the "Rules and Regulations" as therein provided, and including the payment of any of Landlord's *514 legal expenses pertaining to Landlord's legal actions against Tenant.
PX 2. On January 4, 1999, Green deeded the building in which the Premises are located to PG 1044.
Sirene One opened a beauty salon at 1044 Madison Avenue named "Karen Wu: Beauty and Wellness Spa." In 2001, Siren One failed to make a number of rental payments. Tr. at 12-13. After making several verbal and written demands, PG 1044 commenced eviction proceedings. Tr. at 12, 15. The parties entered into a stipulation of

The jury returned a verdict for plaintiff for $65,000.00 on which judgment was entered.  The defendants appealed contending that the district court erred (1) in admitting evidence concerning plaintiff's payment of hospital and medical expenses of its injured employees, (2) in the admission of certain evidence concerning the cost of repairs to damaged equipment and property, (3) in the exclusion of evidence concerning the design of the diesel locomotive, and (4) in giving certain instructions tendered by plaintiff and refusing certain instructions requested by defendants.


4
The main contested issues are (1) whether plaintiff, as a matter of law, had a right to recover for amounts expended in payment of hospital and medical bills of its injured employees, and (2) whether evidence of percentage increases added to the amounts paid for labor and materials under a formula utilized by twenty-five major railroads in charging each other for repairs was admissible in proving the cost to plaintiff of repairs it made to its damaged property and equipment.


5
The trial court permitted the introduction of evidence, over defendants' objection, that plaintiff paid hospital and medical bills of injured members of the train crew, together with the amount of such expenditures.  Defendants objected to admission of evidence of such payments as elements of damages.  They do not question the fairness or reasonableness of the amounts involved but contend that the plaintiff was under no legal obligation to pay these bills, was a mere volunteer in doing so, and is therefore, as a matter of law, not entitled to recover such amounts from defendants.


6
In a similar situation this court rejected the contention that a railroad was a mere volunteer and held it entitled to indemnification for amounts paid for medical services to its employees for injuries caused by the negligent third party.  Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Company v. United States, 7 Cir., 220 F.2d 939.  Similar holdings were made in St. Louis-San Francisco Ry. Co. v. United States, 5 Cir., 187 F.2d 925 and United States v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co., 10 Cir., 171 F.2d 377.  In the cases cited settlements had been made with the employee compromising his claim against the railroad.  Such factor, however, does not in our opinion serve to alter the legal principle involved nor afford a basis for distinguishing the cases cited.  Settlement does not affect legal liability.  The district court did not err in admitting evidence concerning payment of

The first opinion of the district court showed an awareness of the problem in rejecting the estimates of the reproduction cost, less depreciation, of the facilities in question, and particularly in an acute analogy it drew to the loss of earnings by a person seeking recovery for personal injuries. But in its later acceptance of the somewhat reduced estimates of the defendants' expert, accompanied as they were by an accumulation of imprecise theory in what we may say is the strong tradition of American judicial valuation, it got itself into the position of assuming a loss before one was proven and of measuring it by the extent of curtailment of the facilities. For that in last analysis was at the bottom of Mr. Scharff's tests, even though he strove for a standard based upon the best modern and economical or ideal equipment. Obviously with his yardstick the result varied according to the shortening of the gas mains or the electric distributing cables. Such a rule means of course that a utility is sure to receive a substantial award upon any shift in use of its facilities forced by governmental authority, even though such a shift may be a great advantage to it, or its previous business a losing one. Pressed to its logical conclusion, this would even mean that an award should be *397 made for the shutting off of outlets on the condemnation of buildings fronting on a street containing public utility facilities  a position clearly unsupportable in theory or on authority. Kellettville Gas Co. v. United States, D.C., W.D.Pa., 56 F.Supp. 919; Deepe v. United States, 103 Colo. 294, 86 P.2d 242; Fix v. City of Tacoma, 171 Wash. 196, 17 P.2d 599; In re Fort Greene Houses, Borough of Brooklyn, 177 Misc. 101, 29 N.Y.S.2d 980, affirmed 266 App.Div. 795, 41 N.Y.S.2d 859, Id., 291 N.Y. 788, 53 N.E.2d 367.
The error becomes emphasized when it is taken in connection with the court's refusal to consider evidence offered by the United States that the expansion of the Brooklyn Navy Yard had resulted in a substantial increase in business to the utilities so that actually no loss had been incurred. As the cases cited above show, evidence as to prospective earnings from the franchise is highly important. Of course gains from operation in one part of a city, due to natural growth or

JOINT OR SUCCESSIVE LIABILITY
Before reaching the other issues before us, we must cross a threshold hurdle first erected by the City and now positioned by Burke. Although this case was tried on a theory of joint and several liability, the City argued in a post-trial motion, and again before the appellate court, that it was a successive tortfeasor, and should thus be liable for only its proportionate share of the damages. In responding to the City's motion, Burke, on the other hand, argued that the jury was properly instructed to find joint and several liability. The appellate court correctly found that, where the City's position before that court was inconsistent with its stance in an earlier court proceeding, the City had waived its right to complain of an error in the jury instructions. (209 Ill.App.3d at 201, 154 Ill.Dec. 80, 568 N.E.2d 80; see Auton v. Logan Landfill, Inc. (1984), 105 Ill.2d 537, 543, 86 Ill.Dec. 438, 475 N.E.2d 817.) Now Burke argues before this court that the defendants were successive tortfeasors, while the City maintains that it and Rothschild's acted jointly. We deem the argument to be waived by Burke as well as by the City. However, as this court has previously noted, the waiver rule exists as an admonition to litigants rather than as a limitation upon the jurisdiction of the reviewing court. (American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees, Council 31 v. County of Cook (1991), 145 Ill.2d 475, 480, 164 Ill.Dec. 904, 584 N.E.2d 116.) Thus we shall address the issue briefly in order to reaffirm and clarify Illinois law.
Plaintiff argues that separate acts of misconduct by the defendants at wholly separate times demonstrate that the City was a successive tortfeasor. To support his theory, plaintiff cites Gertz v. Campbell (1973), 55 Ill.2d 84, 302 N.E.2d 40. In Gertz, the plaintiff suffered a broken leg due to the negligent driving of a motorist. The defendant motorist then alleged in a third-party complaint that the treating physician's negligence in delaying surgery led to the necessity of amputating plaintiff's leg. Thus, the motorist asked for indemnity and judgment against the physician for the damages caused by the new injury and aggravation of the original injury. In determining

 6.	 Statutes: Appeal

Moreover, even assuming that the findings necessary to demonstrate the compelling governmental interest to support the *450 limited closure were made, the trial court was required to consider any alternatives that might have been more narrowly tailored to protect the privacy interests of prospective jurors and the defendant's right to a fair trial. Press-Enterprise Co., 464 U.S. at 511, 104 S.Ct. at 825, 78 L.Ed.2d at 639. We realize that, unlike Press-Enterprise I, the trial court did allow the press and public access to the questions to be asked of prospective jurors by both the prosecutor and defense counsel as well as allowing access to the stenographer's notes. The record also indicates that the trial court, both counsel, and petitioners unsuccessfully attempted to reach a compromise that would have allowed Breton access to the voir dire examination of prospective jurors. Because we have already ruled that the trial court failed to make findings sufficient to justify limited closure, we need not decide whether the trial court's consideration of these alternatives was constitutionally sufficient. However, we commend the trial court's sensitivity to this issue in considering these alternatives and urge trial courts in the future to consider these and other alternatives to closure that will be less intrusive on the press and public's right of access yet still capable of protecting the legitimate interests of prospective jurors and the defendant.
Finally we emphasize the trial court's obligation to permit access to those parts of the record not deemed sensitive when a closure is ordered.[3] The trial court must carefully balance the competing constitutional interests to ensure that the interests of justice are served. In this respect we believe that the following expression by the United States Supreme Court in Press-Enterprise I offers guidance to future trial courts:
"When limited closure is ordered, the constitutional values sought to be protected by holding open proceedings may be satisfied later by making a transcript of the closed proceedings available within a reasonable time, if the judge determines that disclosure can be accomplished while safeguarding the juror's valid privacy interests. Even then a valid privacy right may rise to a level that part of the transcript should be sealed, or the name of a juror withheld, to protect the person from embarrassment." 464 U.S. at 512, 104 S.Ct. at 825, 78 L.Ed.2d at 640.
We believe these sentiments advocate a course of action designed to limit the detrimental impact on the press and public's right of access at the same time that sensitivity to the legitimate privacy rights of prospective jurors is maintained

In 6 C.J.S. Appearances § 14b, page 44, it is stated:
"* * * an appearance, required by the terms of an order to show cause, to contest an interlocutory motion is an appearance to the motion only and is not a general appearance subjecting defendant to the court's jurisdiction generally. * * *"
The use of a show cause order is usually effective only to the extent that it requires the defendant, if he so desires, to contest the necessity of the ad interim order, without the necessity of having to appear generally or answer. It does not have the effect insofar as the res or the issues in the main case are concerned of compelling him to answer or voluntarily putting himself in court. Likewise, if a defendant appears on return of the order to show cause, answers and argues the merits of the interlocutory order, such appearance has only a limited effect and is not such as to invoke the general jurisdiction of the court in the main suit. Gibson v. State (Tex.Civ.App.), 288 S.W.2d 577; Armour v. Armour, 142 N.J.Eq. 337, *482 59 A.2d 410; Henderson v. Henderson, 10 N.J. 390, 91 A.2d 747.
Venue relates to a trial upon its merits, and not merely to interlocutory orders that have no relation to an issue of law or fact, going to the merits of the case. Powell v. Goldsmith (Tex.Civ.App.), 164 S.W.2d 45; McKinney v. Texas Life Ins. Co. (Tex.Civ.App.), 143 S.W.2d 789, 790; Thacher Medicine Co. v. Trammell (Tex. Civ.App.), 279 S.W. 307; City of Fort Worth v. Fort Worth Acid Works (Tex. Com.App.), 259 S.W. 919. For this reason, the conduct of the appellee in appearing before the court and agreeing for continuance and further agreeing for the court to continue the previous order into effect was not such as to invoke the general jurisdiction of the court in the main suit and thereby establish, as a matter of law, that appellee waived her plea of privilege.
While special appearances are not recognized in this state, except for the purpose of contesting the jurisdiction of the court as provided for in Rule 120a, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, we think a defendant

In his first point, Appellant argues that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to file a motion to suppress or object at trial to the security guard’s identification of Appellant at the scene as the burglar.  To succeed on an ineffective assistance claim, the defendant must show that (1) counsel’s performance was deficient and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced his defense.  
Strickland v. Washington
, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 2064 (1984).  To show deficient performance, the defendant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his counsel’s representation fell below the standard of professional norms.  
Id. 
at 688, 104 S. Ct. at 2064.  To demonstrate prejudice, the defendant must show a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.  
Id. 
at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068.

Appellant claims that there can be no strategic explanation that would justify a decision to refrain from attacking the security guard’s on-scene identification of Appellant.  However, failure to file a motion to suppress or to object to the admission of evidence does not demonstrate a deficiency of counsel per se.

, 942 S.W.2d 703, 710 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1997, no pet.).  To show that counsel’s performance was deficient, Appellant was obliged to prove that the motion would have been granted or that the objection would have been sustained.

Background
American Plumbing & Mechanical, Inc. and its affiliated companies filed a chapter 11 case in October 2003. AMPAM was a nationwide plumbing contracting firm, formed as a result of a "roll up" of numerous regional plumbing contractors in the 1990's. It ran into financial difficulties with its lenders and finally decided to seek chapter 11 protection in order to restructure its debt.
The owners of the regional companies continued to function in leadership capacities with what became, after the rollup, their operating subsidiary, both before and after the bankruptcy filing. Senior officers in each operating subsidiary were entitled,[1] pursuant to an incentive bonus program that had been in place prior to the filing of the case, to receive a bonus calculated on how well each division did, based on an EBITDA target, and an additional bonus to the extent this EBITDA target was exceeded. One of the first day orders signed in this case authorized the debtor to honor various employee benefits, including this incentive program (though it was not specifically referenced in that first day order). When it came time to consider 2003 bonuses in early 2004, the company's board of directors elected to pay bonuses to some officers, but held off paying senior executives (i.e., persons who were stockholders of AMPAM or former owners of the debtor's operating subsidiaries, sometimes referred to as "Founders"), for fear of being sued by the Official Committee of Creditors, dominated at that time by the bondholders who held a debt in excess of $93 million. Eventually, the board directed the debtors' lawyers to file a pleading seeking independent specific authorization to pay bonuses to these most senior executives. The motion, filed in April 2004, alleged that the payments were in the ordinary course of the debtor's business, but acknowledged the possible argument that paying the bonuses to persons who were shareholders and/or Founders might *446 be inconsistent with the discharge of the board's fiduciary duties on behalf of the estate. Sure enough, the motion drew an objection from the creditors' committee, and was not heard before the plan was confirmed.[2]
During the course of the case, some of the senior executives from one of those operating subsidiaries, Riggs Plumbing, sought to "break away," triggering an injunction fight on the part of the bankruptcy estate. Gerald Riggs, the president of that operating subsidiary, quit his position with AMPAM, but was not actively involved in the breakway company due to a covenant not to compete in his employment contract. Rick Jepson,

Deputy Clinage might have given), it was the State’s duty to present that evidence at the hearing.

Neither Sergeant Schmoll, nor the State acted to ensure proof of reasonable suspicion.

OPINION BY JUDGE MENCER, May 26, 1972:
The Commonwealth has appealed from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Cambria County which reversed the action of the Secretary of Transportation in suspending the operator's license of one Francis Shero (appellee) for ninety (90) days.
In Virnelson Motor Vehicle Operator License Case, 212 Pa. Superior Ct. 359, 368, 243 A. 2d 464 (1968), it was held that "[a]t the hearing before the lower court the Commonwealth should produce the records of convictions received by the Department of Revenue [now Department of Transportation[1]] from the magistrates and courts of record in the proper form, and the secretary's record compiled therefrom which justified the suspension."
Here the Commonwealth produced a single exhibit at the hearing before the lower court. This exhibit was *475 a copy of a traffic citation indicating a disposition by a "found guilty" adjudication. The signature of the person signing the adjudication was illegible and the Commonwealth's attorney so admitted for the record. This exhibit was not certified as true and correct by the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary).
Much more fatal to the Commonwealth's case is that no record was offered of the other underlying convictions[2] to support the point record of the appellee. The production of such records is an essential prerequisite under the holding of Virnelson Motor Vehicle Operator License Case, supra. If the suspension of an operator's license is to rest upon the record of points assessed by the Secretary, that record must be complete, self-sustaining and certified to be true and correct. The following colloquy is found in the record:
"BY MR. NASSAU [Commonwealth's attorney]: I would also like to state for the record our file is lacking any conviction report from a magistrate of a hearing, and is also lacking any notice given to the defendant of scheduling a hearing.
"BY THE COURT: Well, of course, under the Act, there must be a conviction noted to assess the points."

Roger A. Wolfe, Charleston, James B. Stoneking, Morgantown, for appellee. *424
*426 BROTHERTON, Justice:
This is an appeal from a summary judgment granted in favor of the appellee, Eastern Associated Coal Corporation, and against the appellant, Dorwin Conaway, by the Circuit Court of Monongalia County, West Virginia. Mr. Conaway, a former employee of Eastern, charged his former employer with age discrimination, wrongful discharge, and breach of contract. We agree with the trial court's action, and affirm.
Mr. Conaway was first employed by Eastern as a utility man in March, 1968, and became a foreman in 1969. In December, 1971, Conaway voluntarily resigned his position with Eastern and accepted a similar position with another company. However, he later returned to work for Eastern in September, 1972, as a section foreman in the Federal No. 2 Mine near Fairview, West Virginia. With the exception of a twenty-one month lay-off as a result of a back injury, Conaway continued to work for Eastern until his discharge in October, 1980.
Mr. Conaway was not a model employee. On numerous occasions noted in the record, Conaway was issued verbal or written notices for safety-related violations or refusing to obey orders from management. In his performance reviews, Conaway was given an overall acceptable rating, but the reports showed several shortcomings. He received an unacceptable rating for obeying safety regulations on a January 22, 1980, review. As to his work initiative, the report noted: "Feels that other should take care of needs he is responsible for. Tries to talk the work done instead of doing. If more time was spent doing instead of talk, would accomplish goals." As to his knowledge of the UMWA contract and company policy, the review noted that Conaway "tries to BS his way instead of using facts." Additionally, the review noted: "Conaway is an older, more experienced foreman. He feels he can get by

Blue Hole, used frequently in the record, signifies the original canal from where water was taken from the Platte River by the use of a siphon a considerable distance west of Section 4 and continuing from there generally eastward, with variations to the northeast, to and through Section 4 including Lots 6, 7, and 8 thereof, and into Section 3 where it joined the Kearney Canal proper. Later, in 1941, a new connection was made between the river and Blue Hole. Headgates were installed and by this means water was taken from the river, through the headgates, into Blue Hole, and transported by it to the Kearney Canal which originated in Section 3. A change was thereafter made at the west end of the Kearney Canal. The water from Blue Hole was discharged in the river near but above the headgates and when desired it and other water were taken from the Platte River through the headgates into the Kearney Canal. Blue Hole has at all times been and is beneficially used. It is now largely a stand-by facility but the water therefrom is used at times *414 in carrying out the purposes of the project of which it is a part. The land south of Blue Hole is necessary to protect the canal, the operations conducted by the lessees, and for access to and maintenance and improvement of the works. There has been no abandonment of Blue Hole. Appellee has an interest in the subject of this litigation. It is a lessee of the owner and it has capacity to contest and defend this cause. A lessee may maintain an action to quiet title to his leasehold. A tenant is entitled to the exclusive possession and use of the demised property in the absence of reservation or restriction in his lease. Peterson v. Vak, 160 Neb. 450, 70 N.W.2d 436, 51 A.L.R.2d 1221, on rehearing 160 Neb. 708, 71 N.W.2d 186, 51 A.L.R.2d 1221; Annotation, 51 A.L.R.2d 1227. The converse is obviously true that a lessee may defend an action to quiet title which seeks to establish a claim of title adverse to the tenant and to deprive him permanently of the property involved.
Appellants must, to succeed in this case on their plea of adverse possession, rely on the strength of their title and not upon any possible weakness in the interest or title of appellee

It shall be unlawful for any person, other than a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, or licensed collector to transport into or receive in the State where he resides ... any firearm purchased or otherwise obtained by such person outside that State ...

Defendant does not dispute that he was not a licensed importer, manufacturer, dealer or collector of firearms.  His sole contention is that by virtue of his dual residency in both the state in which he purchased the guns and the state into which he transported the guns, he is exempt from the proscriptions of the statute.

In determining the scope of the statute and the persons to whom it is applicable, we must consider not only the plain meaning of the language used in the statute, but also must interpret that language in light of the purposes Congress sought to serve by promulgating the relevant laws.   Dickerson v. New Banner Institute, Inc., --- U.S. ----, 103 S.Ct. 986, 994, 74 L.Ed.2d 845 (1983);  Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization, 441 U.S. 600, 608, 99 S.Ct. 1905, 1911, 60 L.Ed.2d 508 (1979).  In a number of cases, the United States Supreme Court has recognized and given weight to the broad prophylactic purposes of the Act:

When Congress enacted [18 U.S.C. Sec. 921 et seq.] it was concerned with the widespread traffic in firearms and with their general availability to those whose possession thereof was contrary to the public interest ....

Dickerson, 103 S.Ct. at 994;  Huddleston v. United States, 415 U.S. 814, 824 [94 S.Ct. 1262, 1268, 39 L.Ed.2d 782] (1974), quoting S.Rep. No. 1501, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 22 (1968).

 GIBSON, C.J.
 Defendant De La Guerra Properties, Inc., owned a building, part of which was leased to the El Paseo Restaurant, operated by defendant Smith. Both owner and tenant were sued for damages for injuries suffered by plaintiff, a prospective patron of the restaurant, when she fell onto a private walk which served as one of the approaches to the building. At the conclusion of plaintiff's evidence, the trial court took the case from the jury and granted a nonsuit. Plaintiff appeals from the judgment entered upon such order.
 The De La Guerra building was located at the corner of Anacapa and De La Guerra Streets in the City of Santa Barbara. The northerly line of the property adjoined the southerly property line of a service station and parking lot owned and operated by an oil company. The private walk was located on the northerly ten feet of the De La Guerra property and ran the full length of the building, joining at its easterly end the public sidewalk on Anacapa Street and *397 terminating westerly at the rear of the building. This walk was used as an entrance to the various establishments in the building. Three doors opened onto the walk, one of them leading into a passageway which was used as a side entrance for customers of the restaurant. Signs were maintained over this door by the owner, or by the tenant with the permission of the owner, reading, "El Paseo"--"De La Guerra Studios"--"Restaurante Del Paseo Entrance." There were three or more other entrances to the restaurant, consisting of passageways leading through the building to the adjoining streets.
 For a period of several years after construction of the private walk, and before the oil company acquired the adjoining property, patrons of the establishments in the building used the adjoining property as a parking lot, which had been graded by defendant De La Guerra Properties, Inc., so that it sloped down to the private walk. After the oil company acquired the adjoining premises, it constructed a concrete wall on the southerly edge of its property which abutted and ran the entire length of the walk. The wall varied in height from approximately six inches above the walk at the easterly end to two feet at the westerly end. On the adjoining property, and adjacent to the wall, there was an unpaved parkway ten feet wide. A concrete curb approximately seven inches high separated the parkway from the

Plaintiff Ronald E. Termunde brought a habeas corpus petition in the district court, assailing the conditions of the shower rooms in section II, building III, Uinta facility of the Utah State Prison. Termunde claimed that peeling paint, fecal matter, semen, body hair, and germs in the showers constituted a hazard to his health and life, and he sought redress for what he said was an unconstitutional holding in prison. The trial court held an evidentiary hearing and then ordered the Salt Lake County Health Department to inspect the shower rooms and to report the results to the trial court within twenty days. The health department reported that none of the items claimed by Termunde to be present in the showers were found on the walls or ceilings of the showers but peeling paint and poor drainage were observed. The health department had suggested to the prison authorities that waterproof epoxy paint be used to repaint the showers within ten days, that nonslip strips be included on the shower floors, and that walls and ceilings be scrubbed daily to prevent build-up of soap film.
With that information before it, the trial court in its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order found that the health hazard of which Termunde complained did not exist, concluded that Termunde's condition of confinement did not constitute a violation of one of his important rights, and denied the relief Termunde sought in his petition for habeas corpus.
On appeal, Termunde raises, pro se, three points: (1) The health department denied that the conditions as described by Termunde existed. (2) The conditions complained of persisted after the denial of the habeas corpus petition. (3) The prison fails to provide the reasonable care to Termunde and other inmates required of it as a state institution. The state responds that the trial court's findings were not clearly erroneous and its conclusions based on those findings were correct, so that its judgment should be affirmed. We agree and affirm the denial of the petition for habeas corpus.
The law has developed to a point where a habeas corpus petition is the proper vehicle to assail as unconstitutional conditions of confinement in prisons, "although the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus in such a case would result only in the elimination of that specific condition of physical imprisonment and not in [an inmate's] release from every aspect of physical imprisonment."

Before RADER, LINN and MOORE, Circuit Judges.

PER CURIAM.

      Garyson Ford appeals a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans

Claims (Veterans Court), Ford v. Peake, No. 06-1175 (Vet. App. Feb. 27, 2008),

affirming a Board of Veterans’ Appeals (Board) decision denying entitlement to an

earlier effective date of service connection for schizophrenia. Because Mr. Ford raises

only a new, fact-based challenge on appeal, we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.

      Mr. Ford served on active duty from March 1977 to September 1979. In April

1983, the Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO) denied him service connection for a

nervous condition. After denying multiple subsequent claims for service connection, the

RO granted service connection in October 1998 and assigned a 100% disability rating
effective November 30, 1993. Mr. Ford filed a

DISCUSSION

Standard of Review
To grant relief from the restrictions of the writ, the trial court was required to make a finding that approval of the project would not "impact on the ability of the City to adopt and implement an adequate housing element" in its general plan (§ 65755, subd. (a)(5)) or "significantly impair" the ability of the City to adopt or amend all or part of its general plan (§ 65755, subd. (b)(1)).
On appeal, we must review both a question of law, that is, the meaning of the term "significantly impair" as used in the statute, and a question of fact, that is, whether substantial evidence supported the trial court's implied determination that Monte Sereno's project would significantly impair the adoption of a valid general plan. (See Hanly v. Kleindienst (2d Cir.1972) 471 F.2d 823, 828.) We independently construe the meaning of the statute. (See, e.g., No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 83-85 [118 Cal. Rptr. 34, 529 P.2d 66].) (1) However, in reviewing the trial court's determinations on questions of fact, we are bound by the established rules that "all factual matters will be viewed most favorably to the prevailing party, that all questions of credibility are within the province of the trier of fact, that the appellate court ordinarily looks only at the evidence supporting the successful party and disregards the contrary showing, that all conflicts must be resolved in favor of the judgment appealed from and that the power of the appellate court begins and ends with a determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence contradicted or uncontradicted, *1011 which will support the conclusion reached by the trier of fact. [Citations.]" (McCurter v. Older (1985) 173 Cal. App.3d 582, 585 [219 Cal. Rptr. 104].) The same rule applies whether the trial court made factual findings based on oral testimony or on declarations. (Trapasso v. Superior Court (1977) 73 Cal. App.3d 561, 568 [140 Cal. Rptr. 820].)

Section 65755, Subdivision (b)
In the trial court, Monte Sereno moved under section 65755, subdivision (b) for relief from the restrictions of the writ. (2) Monte Se

may also look to the best interest factors in R.C. 3109.04(F)(1) for guidance. In re K.A., 9th

Dist. Lorain Nos. 15CA010850, 15CA010860, 2017-Ohio-1, ¶ 17. While some factors overlap

with those above, others include the children’s adjustment to their environment; the mental and

physical health of all persons involved; the parties’ history of providing support and honoring

companionship orders; certain indicia of violence, abuse, or neglect in any household involved;

and whether a party plans to or has established a residence outside of Ohio. R.C. 3109.04(F)(1).

       {¶14} H.S. was eleven years old at the time of the hearing. She has done well in school.

She has been in counseling to address issues of anxiety, depression, and self-esteem.

       {¶15} The child’s custodial history is detailed above.         She has had a consistent

relationship with both Mother and Grandmother throughout her life. In addition to residing with

Grandmother for the first four years of her life, H.S. was under Grandmother’s guardianship

from October 2014 through June 2015, while Mother was engaged in military training with the

National Guard. At all other times, the child was in Mother’s legal custody and enjoyed regular

visitation with Grandmother. The child is well adjusted to both home environments.

       {¶16} H.S. has resided with Mother, Mother’s husband whom she calls “daddy,” a half-

sibling, and a step-sibling for several years. Her stepfather has been the only father-figure the

child has ever known. In fact, H.S. always believed her stepfather was her biological father until

Grandmother told her that he was not. Although the guardian ad litem reported that the child’s

counselor indicated that H.S. and her stepfather had a “conflictual relationship,” Mother testified

that the child and her stepfather are bonded and have a good relationship. The child enjoys a

good relationship with her half- and step-siblings. The child has been resistant to Mother’s

efforts to set limits and discipline her

439 F.3d 1100, 1105 (9th Cir. 2006), and we grant the petition for review, and

remand.

      The agency concluded Ren was not credible because he omitted an airport

detention from his asylum application, and because of inconsistencies in his

testimony regarding the name of the church he attends in the United States, the

name of the pastor of this church, and the topic of the most recent sermon.

However, the airport detention did not relate to the basis of Ren’s alleged fear of

persecution, and the agency’s three perceived inconsistencies regarding Ren’s

church in the United States are minor inconsistencies that do not go to the heart of

his claim. See Mendoza-Manimbao v. Ashcroft, 329 F.3d 655, 660 (9th Cir. 2003).

Accordingly, substantial evidence does not support the agency’s adverse credibility

determination. See Bandari, 227 F.3d 1160, 1165 (9th Cir. 2000).

      We grant the petition and remand for further proceedings to determine

whether, taking Ren’s testimony as true, he is eligible for asylum, withholding of

removal, or CAT relief. See Soto-Olarte v. Holder, 555 F.3d 1089, 1095-96 (9th

      PETITION

Mosley, Wells, Johnson & Ruttum, P.C., James H. Mosley, Neil L. McClain, Denver, Colo., for defendant-appellee.
Opinion by Judge TURSI.
United Guaranty Residential Insurance Company (United) appeals from the summary judgment entered against it upon its action to collect a deficiency resulting from the foreclosure of Wilma Vanderlaan's interest in certain real property. We affirm.
The essential facts are agreed. United is a private insurer of mortgages. In 1982, Vanderlaan and two others executed a promissory note secured by a deed of trust upon a condominium unit in favor of United's insured, the mortgagee. In 1984 or 1985, the mortgagors defaulted, and the mortgagee commenced a public trustee's foreclosure of the secured property. The note holder brought the required proceeding pursuant to C.R.C.P. 120 for authorization of the foreclosure sale, and on October 7, 1985, the court accordingly authorized the sale, having found a reasonable probability that a default had occurred and that sale was otherwise proper pursuant to the Soldiers' and Sailors' Relief Act of 1940.
On October 14, 1985, counsel for United's insured duly submitted to the public trustee a full indebtedness bid in the amount of some $200,000. The public trustee conducted a public auction sale of the property on October 16, 1985, and sold the property to the insured note holder as the highest bidder for the bid amount. A certificate of purchase was accordingly executed.
The insured thereafter discovered the bid was erroneous in that the amount intended to be bid was in fact some $75,000 less than the $200,000 submitted. Consequently, the insured filed a motion with the C.R.C.P. 120 court requesting the bid be changed to $126,000.
On November 27, 1985, the court, following a short hearing, permitted the insured to withdraw its previously accepted bid and substituted therefor a bid of $126,000. Pursuant to the court's order, the October 16, 1985, certificate of purchase was corrected to reflect the new bid amount. Although no new sale or notice of sale was ordered, the court extended the mortgagors' period of redemptive rights for 75 days from the date of the hearing. The insured apparently mailed copies of its motion and notice of hearing to Vanderlaan, but she did not appear, although her co-mortgag

In Frey v. Amoco Production Co., 943 F.2d 578 (5th Cir.1991) we decided, inter alia, that when a Louisiana mineral lease provides the lessor "royalty on gas sold by the Lessee of one-fifth ( 1/5) of the amount realized at the well from such sales," take-or-pay payments, received by the lessee from a pipeline-purchaser for gas not taken, are subject to the lessor's royalty.  Id. at 580-86.   Our decision states the meaning of this suit's royalty clause as a matter of Louisiana law.   While we continue to believe in the propriety of our rationale and its consequence, Amoco convinces us in its Petition for Rehearing that the precise meaning of the royalty clause at issue in this suit carries tremendous consequences for Louisiana's gas industry and its citizens who own mineral interests in Louisiana real estate.   We agree with Amoco that Louisiana's Supreme Court is the appropriate authority to decide whether the royalty clause at issue in this case requires Amoco to share take-or-pay payments with Frey, its lessor.   So we exercise the certification privilege granted by Rule XII of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Louisiana.

Our opinion at 943 F.2d 578 (5th Cir.1991) recites this case's facts, but that opinion contains one minor error.

The Settlement Agreement permitted Columbia to recoup the entire $45.

JORDAN, Circuit Judge.

   Freddie Dodard appeals the sentence imposed on him by the United States District

Court for the District of New Jersey for possession and distribution of cocaine base in

violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841. For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.

   I. Background

       In two separate instances, in December 2012 and February 2013, Dodard sold a

combined total of 61.3 grams of crack cocaine to a cooperating witness. A grand jury

issued a two-count indictment against Dodard for (1) possession with intent to distribute

twenty-eight grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and

(b)(1)(B)(iii); and (2) possession with intent to distribute a quantity of cocaine base, in

violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C). On November 18, 2014, Dodard

entered into an agreement with the government whereby he pleaded guilty to Count Two

of the indictment.

       In anticipation of sentencing, the United States Probation Office prepared a

presentence report. That report recommended that Dodard, by virtue of his prior

convictions, qualified as a career offender under U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1, resulting in his being

within criminal history category VI. That status, taken together with the offense conduct

and a deduction for acceptance of responsibility, yielded an advisory guidelines range of

151 to 188 months. Dodard did not and does not challenge the guidelines calculation.

       Prior to the sentencing hearing, both Dodard and the government submitted

sentencing memoranda to the District Court. At that hearing, Dodard sought leniency

from the Court on several grounds, placing significant emphasis on his history of mental

                                              2
health issues. He also questioned the seriousness of the offenses on his record, as well as

the current offense, nearly all of which consist of non-violent drug offenses. He then

read from an article by a former judge discussing the disproportionate and often


breach of contract, the parties do not have adverse legal interests, and there is no
justiciable controversy.
       {¶ 14} Kincaid argues that there is no language in the policy that requires
him to notify Erie in any particular way or within a certain time in order to
recover his expenses. This is the rationale that the appellate court used to reverse
the trial court’s dismissal of the action. Yet the appellate court acknowledged that
“it may seem illogical that an insurer is required to pay for expenses that the
insured never notified the company about.” Kincaid v. Erie Ins. Co., 183 Ohio
App.3d 748, 2009-Ohio-4372, 918 N.E.2d 1036, ¶ 20. We agree. It is illogical;
and it defies common sense to expect an insurer to pay for incidental expenses
that it does not know its insured incurred.
       {¶ 15} The policyholder is in the best position to know what out-of-pocket
expenses he or she incurred. Only the insured knows whether he or she incurred
travel expenses when attending a deposition. The mere fact that the insured
attended a deposition does not mean that there were travel, mileage, or parking
expenses associated with it. Only the insured knows whether he or she suffered a
loss of earnings. There are many reasons why an insured would not suffer an
actual loss of earnings when attending a deposition: he or she may have been
unemployed, retired, or salaried. Without documentation and a request, an insurer
does not know whether the insured has incurred expenses and requires
reimbursement.
       {¶ 16} The policyholder who believes that he or she is entitled to
reimbursement must make the insurance company aware of the claim and give it
the opportunity to pay. The insurer provides each policyholder with a copy of the
written insurance policy that expressly discloses the potential availability of
benefits, including reimbursement for expenses.       The insured has a duty to
examine the coverage provided and is charged with knowledge of the contents of
the policy. Fry v. Walters & Peck Agency, Inc. (2001), 141 Ohio App.3d 303,

312, 750 N.E.2d 1194; Grange Mut. Cas. Co.

Conclusion
This Court reaffirms its determination that officer Reichert did not have reasonable suspicion to detain Zambrana and conduct a search of his car. Reichert's lack of credibility "poisoned the well" of information from which the Court made its determination and made it impossible for this Court to make such a finding.
For the reasons stated in this Court's April 19, 2004 Order  as explained and supplemented by the instant Memorandum and Order  Zambrana's motion to suppress narcotics found in his rental car, as well as statements made by Zambrana and co-defendant Shah is GRANTED.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
NOTES
[1]  Ultimately, Babar Shah pled guilty to the charges he faced as a result of this incident.
[2]  In the interim, the case was remanded the first time as described above.
[3]  The Zambrana case is the only case in which this Court has granted a suppression motion. That lack of familiarity may account for the incomplete articulation.
[4]  At the hearing, Reichert testified that there was fresh damage to the left side of Zambrana's vehicle (Tr. p. 8). Evidence presented later at the hearing showed that the damage was actually on the right side of Zambrana's vehicle (Tr. p. 102).
[5]  According to the docket sheet, Reichert pled guilty to a criminal information in proceedings held before Magistrate Judge Donald Wilkerson in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. In researching and writing this order, the undersigned learned for the first time that the Reichert case was originally randomly assigned to the undersigned Judge (Doc. 1). However, the Defendant and the Government consented to have the magistrate handle the matter (Doc. 2) The consent was filed the same day as the criminal information, so there was no notification to the undersigned of the assignment. In this District, consents to the magistrate in criminal cases are rare. The proceedings were obviously orchestrated well in advance because in only one day  August 30, 2005  an information was filed, Reichert waived his right to be tried by a district judge, waived indictment, signed a plea agreement, signed a stipulation of facts, pled guilty, and was sentenced.

Notably, this Court was never notified of the Reichert plea. This is particularly curious in light of the fact that the United States Attorney's office did inform

III.
Plaintiff seeks exemplary damages from Local 753 as a deterrent to future breaches of the Agreement; Local 753 argues that such damages can never be awarded under § 301. Since the statute is silent on the question  it neither bars nor allows exemplary damages explicitly  the courts must determine the intent of Congress.
The statute is to be applied to obtain industrial peace. This controlling principle was set forth in Textile Workers Union of America v. Lincoln Mills, 353 U.S. 448, 77 S.Ct. 912, 1 L.Ed.2d 972 (1957), in which the Supreme Court reviewed the legislative history of § 301 and said:
"Thus collective bargaining contracts were made `equally binding and enforceable on both parties.' [Senate Report No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 15.] As stated in [House of Representatives Report No. 245, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., at p. 6], the new provision `makes labor organizations equally responsible with employers for contract violations and provides for suit by either against the other in the United States district courts.' To repeat, the Senate Report, supra, p. 17, summed up the philosophy of § 301 as follows: `Statutory recognition of the collective agreement as a valid, binding, and enforceable contract is a logical and necessary step. It will promote a higher degree of responsibility upon the parties to such agreements, and will thereby promote industrial peace.'
"Plainly the agreement to arbitrate grievance disputes is the quid pro quo for an agreement not to strike. Viewed in this light, the legislation does more than confer jurisdiction in the federal courts over labor organizations. It expresses a federal policy that federal courts should enforce these agreements on behalf of or against labor organizations and that industrial peace can be best obtained only in that way." Id. at 454-455, 77 S.Ct. at 916.
See also Dowd Box Co. v. Courtney, 368 U.S. 502, 509, 82 S.Ct. 519, 7 L.Ed.2d 483 (1962).
Vigorous enforcement of collective bargaining agreements in the quest *669 for industrial peace is to proceed by the use of federal substantive law.
"The question then is, what is the substantive law to be applied in suits under § 301(a)? We conclude that the substantive law to apply in suits under § 301(a) is federal law, which the courts must fashion from

This is an appeal from a judgment of the superior court of Pinal county, Cause No. 19693, denying a landlord eviction of tenants of farm property. The action below was a summary proceedings by the appellant-landlord in pursuance of A.R.S. § 33-361,[1] charging a violation of the lease by the tenants in not paying taxes, in charging personal expenses to the lease operation, and in not farming the land properly.
The written lease agreements under which the tenants occupied the subject farm land provided, among other things:
(1) that the landlord and the tenants should divide between them any profit realized on crops which were grown upon the subject land;
(2) that production costs would be "charged 50 per cent to the Lessor's share of the crops grown upon the premises, and 50 per cent to the Lessee's share of such crops";
(3) "that each crop shall stand on its own and that any losses on crops grown upon said premises pursuant to said lease shall be borne and paid by Lessee, and that Lessor shall in no manner be liable for any such losses";

*309 (4) that real property taxes accruing against the subject property were to be treated as "a production cost" and "50 per cent of the taxes shall be paid by Lessor and 50 per cent by the Lessee"; and
(5) that in the event that the tenants should fail to pay rent or "to comply with any other provisions of the lease," the landlord, after thirty days written notice and failure to remedy, "may at that time declare said lease to be at an end and recover possession of said premises without further notice."
For the purposes of this appeal, it is admitted that there were substantial losses sustained in the farming of the subject land for the crop years 1962-63

FACTS
The facts in the light most favorable to the verdict reveal that on September 5, 1994, twenty-year old Carson, his girlfriend, and their baby, went to a convenience store for baby wipes. Carson was from the Concord neighborhood of Gary, Indiana. While in the convenience store, Carson encountered three young men from the rival Terrytown neighborhood. After a confrontation, Carson ran back to his car, obtained a .380 handgun, and fired upon the three other men, killing one of them.
The convenience store video monitors placed Carson in the store immediately before the shooting. The two Attempted Murder victims unequivocally identified Carson as the gunman.
The mother of the victim learned from the victim's friends that Carson had murdered her son. The mother passed this information on to the police. The next day, a drive-by shooting took place at the mother's home. The mother's home was sprayed by approximately thirty shots. One person was shot in the neck. The mother recovered several shotgun shell casings, shell casings, and spent bullets which she turned over to the police.
*218 Two days later, Carson was captured by police. Carson had been with two other men when he was captured. The three men had in their possession a 9 millimeter handgun and a shotgun. Ballistics tests linked the handgun and the shotgun to the drive-by shooting of the victim's mother's home.
At trial, over Carson's objection, the trial court permitted the State to introduce the evidence of the drive-by shooting and the evidence of Carson's nonexclusive, constructive possession of the weapons linking him to the crime. The presentation of this evidence constituted a substantial portion of the trial.

Other Crimes, Wrongs, or Acts. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident, ...
Whenever the State attempts to introduce evidence of instances of the defendant's uncharged misconduct, the trial court must look to see whether that evidence is offered to prove something other than the defendant's bad character or propensity to commit the charged crime. Hardin v. State (1993), Ind., 611 N.E.2d 123, 129. If the evidence is offered

Defendants have not been accused of altering or resetting odometers. The focus of this litigation is the alleged failure to disclosure that the odometer was computing its second hundred thousand miles.
Second, pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 1988 and 49 C.F.R. § 580.4, the odometer reading at the time of the transfer was disclosed. The requirements of 15 U.S.C. § 1988(a)(2) and the related provisions of 49 C.F.R. § 580.4(c) are irrelevant here because they concern a situation where the transferor knows that the odometer reading differs from the actual *100 mileage traveled, but the extent of that difference is unknown. Rider Oldsmobile, Inc. v. Wright, 415 F.Supp. 258 (M.D.Pa. 1976).
Third, the Odometer Mileage Statement provided in 49 C.F.R. § 580.6 and supplied by defendant Carey Paul Ford in this case indicates that:
I, _________ state that the odometer mileage indicated on the vehicle described below is _______ miles.
The form asks for the "odometer mileage indicated" and not the total miles traveled by the car.
By the above reasoning, Congress did not intend to include, and did not include, the nondisclosure of hundred thousand mile increments on five-place odometers within the purview of the proscriptions of the Odometer Disclosure Law. There being no genuine issue of material fact, and the defendant Carey Paul Ford being entitled to judgment as a matter of law, summary judgment on its behalf is proper. Rule 56(c), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
2. The case is currently before the court on the motion of third-party defendant H. W. Roach to dismiss. The liability of a third-party defendant is dependent upon the liability of its third-party plaintiff. Rule 14(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The third-party plaintiff has been adjudged not liable. The complaint against H. W. Roach must be dismissed.
3. The case is before the court on the motion of counsel for defendant Carey Paul Ford to withdraw. The client has been notified and the requirements of Local Rule 71.7, Northern District of Georgia have been met. Summary judgment has been granted on behalf of Carey Paul Ford, but counsel may have his name stricken as counsel of record.

[fact finder], upon consideration of all the evidence, could have rejected [appellant’s] theories

and found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id. “Whether a hypothesis of innocence is

The appellant, Mahomud Rawwad, and four other men were convicted of conspiring to possess heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 846.  The basic facts of the conspiracy are set out in our previous opinion, United States v. Abou-Saada, 785 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.1986), where we affirmed the convictions of three of appellant's co-defendants.  Rawwad has appealed separately.


2
Rawwad's primary claim is that the district court should have severed his case from that of his co-defendants.  Rawwad points out that he was a comparatively minor figure in the conspiracy, his alleged role being that of a courier (for either a heroin sample or an airline receipt for a package containing heroin).  The evidence against him basically consisted of a telephone conversation, recorded on May 18, 1984, during which Rawwad agreed to meet someone to pick up something concealed in a can of shaving cream and the testimony of a witness who observed that meeting and Rawwad's evasive movements thereafter.  The jury concluded that, under the circumstances, the evidence showed his participation.  Although Rawwad does not dispute the sufficiency of the evidence, he does say that its quantity and quality made it unfair to try him together with other members of the conspiracy.


3
The difficulty with this argument lies in the case law holding to the contrary.  The facts that a particular defendant plays a minor role and that the evidence against him can be presented quickly do not make it automatically unlawful to try him with more important figures.   See United States v. Mastroianni, 749 F.2d 900, 914 (1st Cir.1984);  United States v. Smolar, 557 F.2d 13, 21 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 971, 98 S.Ct. 523, 54 L.Ed.2d 461 (1977).  Rather, the question of whether the prejudicial aspects of joinder in such a case outweigh its practical necessity is primarily up to the trial court.  A trial court's decision allowing a single trial is reversible only if the defendant makes a "strong showing of prejudice."   See United States v. Porter, 764 F.2d 1, 12 (1st Cir.1985);  United States v. Arruda, 715 F.2d 671, 6

*1007 Sheldon & Nordmark, Paul C. Brown, Denver, for plaintiff in error.
Wendell A. Peters, C. Hamilton Evans, Denver, for defendant in error.
DOYLE, Justice.
Plaintiff in error, operator of a grocery super market, was the defendant in the trial court in an action in which the plaintiff obtained a personal injury judgment in the amount of $10,000. The action grew out of plaintiff's falling on some ice in a parking lot which was maintained by the defendant adjacent to its store for the use of customers. The plaintiff suffered a broken hip which necessitated an internal reduction operation. Defendant claims that the evidence was insufficient and that plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. On these grounds it seeks reversal of the judgment.
The fall and the injuries occurred on March 26, 1955 while plaintiff was walking out of the store of the defendant carrying a bag of groceries. He was using both hands to carry the bag although he admitted that he could have handled it with one hand. His car had been parked in defendant's parking lot in the third row of cars from the defendant's building and in the second row from the sidewalk which runs alongside the parking lot and in front of the market.
Plaintiff testified that he noticed the icy condition of the parking lot when he arrived and parked his car and that upon alighting from his automobile he walked around in back of the car and warned his wife of the danger. He testified that they threaded their way through the other lines of cars and entered the store without mishap. After finishing his shopping and while on his way back to the car he followed a more direct route (which proved more hazardous) and talked to a friend as he walked along. The slippery place on which he fell was described by plaintiff, his wife and the person to whom plaintiff was talking as about two feet square and as having a ridge three to four inches in height around the edge of it and as being covered with snow. Around this icy area was blacktop which had become wet from the thawing which had been taking place that morning. He testified that he either did not see it or did not recognize it as slippery. There was a slope from the ridge downward and when he stepped on this he slipped sideways onto his right hip. On the evening of March 24, two days before the injury, plaintiff had stopped at defendant's store on his way home from work and he then noticed ice and snow in the parking lot. He also said

DENMAN, Circuit Judge.
The National Labor Relations Board has pending here its petition for the enforcement of its order against respondent which, inter alios, requires respondent to reinstate certain of its employees and to bargain collectively with the employees' Carpenters' Union No. 2570.
Respondent's motion addresses the power of the court to require the taking of further evidence by the Board, which section 10 (e) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. § 160 (e), requires the respondent "shall show to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material."
This motion alleges that since "the entry of the Order by the National Labor Relations Board, a large portion of the employees which the Board ordered reinstated have refused employment, and it is now proper and necessary to take additional testimony that this Court may have before it evidence showing this changed situation. Testimony should be taken and made part of the record herein showing the number of employees included within the Order of the Board who have applied for reinstatement, showing how many were offered reinstatement, and how many have refused reinstatement and reemployment. This evidence should include a showing of how many union members are now employed by respondent, and the fact of representation or non-representation by the union of the majority of the employees in the appropriate unit."
Assuming that as to some of the ordered reinstatements, the question has become moot since the order was made, this is a question of enforcement and not of the validity of the order. We are required to make our order in accord with the Board's unless, on the hearing, it be shown that the evidence on which the order was based *198 does not warrant it. The additional evidence requested here is of matters subsequent to the order sought to be sanctioned by our action, and we hold it not to be "material" within the meaning of section 10 (e) of the act. National Labor Relations Board v. Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, 58 S.Ct. 571, 576, 82 L.Ed. ___; National Labor Relations Board v. Oregon Worsted Co., 9 Cir., 96 F.2d 193, decided April 11, 1938.
The same reasoning applies to the company's claim that since the Board's order was made, the Carpenters' Union No. 2570 may have ceased to be the bargaining agent of a majority of the employees. This is not the extraordinary case in which there is what practically amounts to judicial notice that

Sufficiency of the Evidence to Establish Defendant Alfonso's Possession of Cocaine
(2a) Defendant Alfonso asserts that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he was in possession of cocaine obtained from his home at 508 East 5th Street in Azusa. Defendant Alfonso concedes that he and his wife Elodia were residents of the premises upon the date of the search and seizure of the cocaine; but Alfonso points out that he was absent from the premises when the search was conducted while his wife Elodia was present. From these facts Alfonso argues that only nonexclusive possession is established. Defendant Alfonso's view that a nonexclusive possession of narcotics precludes a finding of possession on his part indicates an erroneous concept of what elements are necessary to support a finding of possession. (3a) "The elements of the crime of possession of narcotics are physical or constructive possession thereof coupled with knowledge of the presence of the drug and its narcotic character [citations]; possession need not be exclusive. [Citation.]" (People v. White (1969) 71 Cal.2d 80, 82 [75 Cal. Rptr. 208, 450 P.2d 600].) (Italics added.)
(4) It is well settled law that the elements of the crime of possession of narcotics may be established by circumstantial evidence and any reasonable inferences drawn therefrom. (People v. Groom (1964) 60 Cal.2d 694 [36 Cal. Rptr. 327, 388 P.2d 359].) (3b) A principle equally well established is that the fact of actual possession of a narcotic substance may constitute substantial evidence that the possessor was aware of its narcotic character. (White, supra, 71 Cal.2d 80, 82.) (2b) Here the narcotic, cocaine, was found concealed in a light fixture of the master bedroom of the premises of defendant and his wife, Elodia. The cocaine, the cutting substance and a substantial sum of money  all located in one hidden place in Alfonso's master bedroom  constitute circumstantial evidence sufficient to support the trial judge's finding that defendant Alfonso was a joint possessor of these items along with his wife, Elodia.
The fact that Alfonso's wife was not charged as a possessor of the contraband provides defendant Alfonso with no defense. Defendant *465 Alfonso presented no evidence to contradict the inference of possession, with knowledge of the narcotic character of the substance

OPINION
WILLIAMS, District Judge.
Brenda Gail Willett instituted this action against Emory and Henry College, alleging that the defendant committed unlawful employment practices in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. The plaintiff has also included a claim for relief under the Equal Pay Act of 1963, 29 U.S.C. § 206(d), and the defendant has moved for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The case is presently before this court for a ruling on that motion.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
The plaintiff was employed as an instructor of Sociology by Emory and Henry College from September 1972 through August 1973. Under the terms of her employment contract with the college, plaintiff was eligible to participate in a group health and hospitalization insurance plan, which provided dependent benefits to the spouses and children of employees if the employee chose to enroll them in the plan and if the dependents met certain eligibility requirements. The policy also included benefit payments for expenses incurred in connection with hospital confinement and surgical treatment for pregnancy and related disabilities. The applicable provision is set forth below:
Pregnancy Expense Benefits . . . are available to you if you are a female Employee, or to your wife if you are a male Employee, and if you are insured with respect to your Dependents. (Emphasis supplied).
Ms. Willett, a single female, enrolled in the group insurance plan for herself and, in May of 1973, submitted a claim to the Travelers Insurance Company, the insurer of the college's group health insurance plan, for surgical and medical services rendered in April of that year for the treatment of a miscarriage. Travelers routinely denied the claim on the grounds that plaintiff did not have dependent coverage and was thereby ineligible for maternity benefits.
*633 On May 14, 1973, plaintiff wrote a letter to the President of the college, Dr. Thomas Chilcote, requesting that Emory and Henry College "reimburse her for $1000 in medical bills" in the event that Travelers Insurance Company refused to pay her pregnancy benefits. In response to this request, President Chilcote sent a letter to plaintiff, dated May 16, 1973, advising her that the issue she raised in connection with her hospitalization claim was between herself and the insurance company and that the college would not assume any liability for pregnancy expenses not reimbursed by the insurer. "The responsibility of Emory

	I. Background

	Â¶2Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Defendant held a birthday party for his seventeen-year-old son at their large multi-story home in Lakewood. Hundreds of teenagers attended the party. Police responded to the party after being called three separate times by a neighbor who reported that âunderage kidsâ were there drinking alcohol. This neighbor also told the police that he believed there were many guns in the house.

	Â¶3Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Because of previous contacts at the residence and concern about possible firearms, the police felt that it was necessary to have several officers respond instead of only a two-person team. The officers arrived at a staging area near the house about an hour after the first call and planned their approach.

	Â¶4Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  As they approached the residence, a number of juveniles fled the residence. One officer, who was covering the perimeter of the house, tried to talk to some of the juveniles to assess the situation. One group included an âextremely intoxicatedâ sixteen-year-old who said that she had consumed six beers at the party. AnotherÂ seventeen-

                                    No. 14-31080

      In May 2011, Detectives Carey Etheredge and Ronnie Quick of the
Natchitoches Parish Sheriff’s Office sought a warrant for Tatum’s arrest for
practicing law without a license. Judge Dee Hawthorne issued the requested
warrant after considering evidence that Tatum helped a woman prepare
divorce papers, did not possess a law license, and had a criminal record that
would preclude him from even obtaining a license were he otherwise qualified.
Tatum was arrested and held at the Natchitoches Parish Detention Center for
three days. He was charged with practicing law without a license, but the
charge was later dismissed as part of a plea agreement.
      In October 2012, Tatum brought suit under Section 1983 against the City

ARGUMENT
Defendant Gee asserts two bases for his motions to dismiss: first, that the plaintiffs are barred from bringing their actions by virtue of Section 2676 of the FTCA, and, second, in the alternative that Section 2676 does not apply, that the plaintiffs are barred by virtue of the common law doctrine of satisfaction.
Section 2676 provides that a judgment in an action under the FTCA constitutes "a complete bar to any action by the claimant, by reason of the same subject matter, *253 against the employee of the government whose act or omission gave rise to the claim." Consequently, the defendant argues, the judgment against the United States for the acts of Gee as the government's employee in the earlier case would be a complete bar to the present action against Gee individually. The plaintiffs argue that Section 2676 is inapplicable to the instant action because, in its opinion affirming this court's judgment against the United States, the Fourth Circuit found that Gee was "furthering his self-interest, not his employer's business, at the time he seduced his patient."[3] Thus, the plaintiffs' argument continues, because Gee was not acting as a government employee during the acts in question, Gee cannot seek immunity under the FTCA. The plaintiffs also contend that the prior FTCA action did not extinguish the present action because they did not pursue the false imprisonment and alienation of affection claims in the earlier case.

ANALYSIS
As an initial matter the court rejects the plaintiffs' contention that the instant action does not arise "by reason of the same subject matter" as the earlier suit so as to avoid the bar of Section 2676. The fact that this action is based on some causes of action which the plaintiffs did not pursue in their original suit against the United States is not dispositive.[4] As explained by Judge Blatt in Armstrong v. Vogel, 424 F.Supp. 445, 447 (D.S.C.1977), the question for the court is whether "the substance of the claim" is the same in the two suits.
In Armstrong, the plaintiff sought damages against the defendant physician, in his individual capacity, for misrepresentation. The doctor had been a defendant in an earlier negligence action under the FTCA, in which judgment for the plaintiff was entered as the result of a settlement. The court granted summary judgment for the defendant in the second action on the grounds that the second action had arisen "by reason of the same subject matter" as the earlier

Before SHANNON, C.J., and EARL W. SMITH and BRADY, JJ.
SHANNON, Chief Justice.
William E. Gibson appeals from the judgment of the district court of Travis County affirming an order of the Board of Trustees of the Texas Municipal Retirement System. The Board's order denied Gibson's application for a supplemental disability benefit. This Court will reverse the judgment of the district court.
At all times material, Gibson was an employee of the Fire Department of the City of Waco, a participating municipality of the Texas Municipal Retirement System. Gibson became a member of the Retirement System in 1962 and remained so until 1982 when he terminated his employment with the City of Waco.
Gibson has suffered from cardiomyopathy, a heart disease, at least from 1978. Cardiomyopathy is progressive and irreversible, and the only known treatment is rest and controlled activity.
Gibson asserts primarily that in the performance of his duties as a fireman on or about April 22, 1980, he aggravated his heart condition. More specifically, Gibson claims that on April 22, 1980, while assisting in the repair of a broken garage door at the fire station, he spent fifteen to twenty minutes with his arms extended over his head putting tension on a heavy spring. Immediately afterward he experienced chest pains in increasing intensity. Referring to that incident, Gibson's physician, William N. Roddy, testified that "I can tell you the day that I saw him in April of 1980, after what had happened to him, it had done him harm that day. His activities of that day had damaged him. I think led him to where he is now." Other medical evidence established that because of his heart condition, Gibson was unable to engage in gainful employment.
In 1981 Gibson filed with the Retirement System an application for (1) a standard disability retirement and for (2) a supplemental disability benefit. The application for the standard disability retirement was grounded upon his claim that he was incapable of engaging in gainful employment because of the heart condition. Public Retirement Systems, Title 110B, §§ 64.303 and 64.306 (1983). Gibson's application

23
In sum:  longstanding, bedrock summary judgment principles--from the days when summary judgment was a relatively disfavored judicial device, and continuing through the Supreme Court's 1986 "trilogy" of summary judgment cases liberalizing the utilization of the device2--are to the effect that fact questions are considered with deference to the nonmovant, inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion, and, in general, genuine issues of material fact are to be left for reasonable resolution by the fact-finder.  Under any principled summary judgment analysis, the record in this case demonstrates the existence of genuine issues of material fact as to Roche's negligence in conducting a urinalysis for drug use on Willis's urine sample which resulted in a "false positive."   The question is not whether we (or the district court) think(s) Plaintiff will or will not prevail at trial.  The question is whether there exist genuine, material fact issues for resolution by the trier of fact.  And whether Roche fulfilled its duty of reasonable care when it tested Willis's urine for methamphetamine use is a genuine, material, disputed fact issue on the record before us.  Drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Summary Judgment Nonmovant Willis, as we must, we conclude that the record in this case contains evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that Roche was negligent in the manner in which it administered the generally reliable GC/MS drug testing technology relative to Willis's urine sample, and that such negligent application of this test technology proximately caused injury to Willis.  Accordingly, we hold that the district court erred in concluding that there was no genuine issue of material fact for fact-finder resolution as to whether Roche fulfilled its duty to Willis.


24
C. REGARDING WILLIS'S NEGLIGENCE DAMAGES;  OR, DID WILLIS FAIL TO PLEAD A VIABLE THEORY OF RECOVERY?


25
Appellee Roche has also argued on appeal that affirmance of the district court's entry of summary judgment is necessary because Willis failed to even plead a viable cause of action under Texas law.  Roche relies on the Texas Supreme Court's recent opinion in Boyles v. Kerr, 855 S.W.2d 593 (Tex.1993), for the proposition that Texas does not recognize a cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress.3

ORDER
ORINDA D. EVANS, District Judge.
This case is before the Court on Petitioner's motion for a further evidentiary hearing and for oral argument before this Court. Petitioner's request for oral argument has previously been granted in part, the Court having heard oral argument on two of Petitioner's contentions pursuant to his request. Otherwise, the motion for further oral argument is hereby DENIED.
In his motion for a further evidentiary hearing, Petitioner asks this Court to hold a hearing in order to consider certain testimony ruled inadmissible or non-discoverable by the Magistrate.
Petitioner's specific complaints are these. First, the Magistrate declined to compel Dennis A. York, Assistant to the Supreme Court of Georgia, to give deposition testimony relative to certain aspects of the Court's sentence review procedures, which matters were deemed by the Magistrate to be subject to a judicial privilege. See Order of April 2, 1979, referencing the Magistrate's Order of January 15, 1979 and Judge Edenfield's Order of February 24, 1979, in a then-companion case, House v. Balkcom, C78-1471A.
Second, Petitioner complains of the Magistrate's decision not to require the Chief Justice of the Georgia Supreme Court, H. E. Nichols, to appear personally or by deposition to corroborate, deny or explain, comments attributed to him by the press on the subject of the death penalty, Petitioner's contention being that the then-Chief Justice (who participated in review of Petitioner's case) was so biased as to deprive Petitioner of a fair sentence review. Although the Magistrate denied Petitioner's motion to compel the attendance of the Chief Justice, the Magistrate's

                Case: 17-10860        Date Filed: 01/31/2018       Page: 2 of 3


       Celestine Thompson, a pro se litigant, appeals the district court’s dismissal

of her action alleging employment discrimination under Title VII of the Civil

Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16; bribery of public officials under 18

U.S.C. § 201(b)(A); the making of false statements under 18 U.S.C. § 1001; and

judicial bias under 28 U.S.C. § 144. The district court dismissed Thompson’s

second amended complaint on alternative grounds. First, the district court

determined it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over Thompson’s claims because

she failed to identify any applicable waiver of federal sovereign immunity.

Second, the district court held that Thompson failed to adequately plead facts

suggesting a plausible claim for relief. On appeal, Thompson contends she has, in

fact, suffered racial discrimination, harassment, and intimidation at the hands of

various agents of the Department of Homeland Security. After review, 1 we affirm.

       Although we liberally construe pro se briefs, arguments not raised on appeal,

even by pro se litigants, are deemed abandoned. Timson v. Sampson, 518 F.3d

870, 874 (11th Cir. 2008); see also Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(8) (requiring appellants

to argue “contentions and the reason for them, with citations to the authorities and

parts of the record on which the appellant relies”). Thompson’s brief, even

       1
          We review de novo a district court’s ruling on a motion to dismiss for lack of subject-
matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). Thacker v. Tenn. Valley
Auth., 868 F.3d 979

During the investigation, one of the officers took appellant's jacket and searched it over her objection. Contraband was discovered and appellant was then placed under arrest. Said officer testified that appellant was incoherent and highly upset at the police station and that, coupled with her "death-wish" statements, there was some suspicion that she may have had weapons in the jacket. He further testified that appellant acted as though she were capable of harming herself. Another officer present at the time testified that appellant was not in control of herself. When asked whether appellant appeared "dangerous to you at all? Were you in fear at all of her?", the officer responded, "I wasn't in fear of her hurting me. I was in fear of her hurting herself." Other officers present testified as to appellant's state of nervousness, despondency and incoherence at the police station.
Upon these facts, appellant contends that the search of her jacket was unreasonable and illegal inasmuch as it was not based upon a warrant or probable cause nor was it a search incident to an arrest. Admittedly, there was no search warrant in this instance nor was there an arrest prior to the search. However, we cannot agree with the appellant that there was no probable cause for the search.
In determining matters concerning the constitutional prohibitions against illegal searches and seizures, we must bear in mind the basic and controlling principle that it is only "unreasonable" searches that are prohibited, not all searches. Whether or not a particular search is reasonable must be determined by the circumstances and facts surrounding that particular search and the manner in which it is conducted. Webster v. State, 201 So.2d 789 (Fla.App. 4th, 1967). Various instances of searches without warrants have been universally recognized as being reasonable, i.e., those incident to a lawful arrest and those where the chance of flight make it impractical to obtain a warrant. However, as noted in Vauss v. United States, 125 U.S.App.D.C. 228, 370 F.2d 250 (1966) "these are merely illustrations of the principle, ... and obviously do not exhaust the situations in which a search without a warrant is reasonable." The fact that a reasonable search happens to yield evidence of a crime even though not so intended is irrelevant.
We think the language of the Webster case, supra, 201 So.2d at 792, is applicable and controlling herein:
"... The preservation of human life is paramount to the right of privacy

I. INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff filed the Second Amended Complaint[1] on August 13, 2010 (Dkt. No. 24). Center for Community Justice and Advocacy ("CCJA" or "Plaintiff") claims that RBS Citizens, N.A. and CCO Mortgage Company[2] ("Defendants") engaged in racially discriminatory real estate practices.
The Second Amended Complaint alleges that Defendants violated: 42 U.S.C. § 3605 of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 ("FHAA") (Count I); 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1982 (Count II); 15 U.S.C. §§ 1691-1691f of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ("ECOA") (Count III); contractual obligations under the Federal Home Affordable Modification Program ("HAMP") and the Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (Count IV); and the Michigan Eliot-Larsen Civil Rights Act (Count V).
Defendants filed the instant Motion to Dismiss on October 12, 2010 (Dkt. No. 29). Plaintiff responded on November 15, 2010 (Dkt. No. 31), and Defendants replied on December 7, 2010 (Dkt. No. 33). Oral argument was held on December 22, 2010.
For the reasons stated below, the Court will grant Defendants' Motion to Dismiss.

II. BACKGROUND
The facts alleged in the Second Amended Complaint are taken as true for purposes *462 of this Motion. In re DeLorean Motor Co., 991 F.2d 1236, 1240 (6th Cir. 1993).
Plaintiff is a nonprofit corporation based in Detroit, Michigan. Plaintiff's purpose is to further equal housing opportunities throughout Southeast Michigan, and Plaintiff provides a number of services and outreach efforts in this regard, including receiving and investigating complaints of fair housing violations.
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants "unfairly serviced the loans of African American borrowers residing in Detroit, Wayne County ... while simultaneously creating greater advantage for borrowers residing in Grosse Pointe, Wayne County[.]" (Compl. ¶ 18). Plaintiff, citing census data, alleges that over 80 percent of Detroit residents are African American, while over 90 percent of Grosse Pointe residents are white. Plaintiff claims that African Americans were specifically discriminated against in loan origination and servicing, refinancing, and foreclosure sales. (Compl. ¶ 21).
Plaintiff attached data from Defendants' 2008 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act ("HMDA") report, reflecting that out of 16 African American

¶ 1.            
DOOLEY, J.  Plaintiffs Scott Mann and the Estate of Nathan LaBrecque appeal from the Windsor Superior Court’s grant of
summary judgment to intervenor-insurer Virginia
Surety Company, determining that insurer would not owe indemnification to
Adventure Quest should it be found liable to plaintiffs for sexual abuse they
experienced while attending Adventure Quest’s school.  On appeal,
plaintiffs argue that insurer was not entitled to summary judgment because the
superior court should not have imputed knowledge of the sexual abuse to
Adventure Quest and because a material fact remained in dispute.  We agree
that a material fact remains in dispute and reverse and remand. 
¶ 2.            
This suit arises out of the conduct of Peter Drutchal,
the executive director of Adventure Quest.  It is undisputed that he
sexually abused both plaintiffs

may be, punishable with death, or by imprisonment in the penitentiary,” and

Okla. Stat. tit. 21 § 645, which in 1981 provided that the type of assault of which

Mr. Maxwell was convicted, was “a felony punishable by imprisonment in the

penitentiary not exceeding five (5) years, or by imprisonment in a county jail not

exceeding one (1) year.”

      Oklahoma law holds that it is the potential punishment—not the actual

punishment—that is used to determine whether a conviction is a felony. See Braly v.

Wingard, 326 P.2d 775, 776 (Okla. 1958) (per curiam) (“It is not the actual




      2
       Mr. Maxwell acknowledges that § 924(e)(2)(B) defines a violent felony as:
“[A]ny crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.” He never
explains, however, why the 1981 conviction does not meet the definition of a violent
felony under federal law. As the government points out, § 924(e)(2)(B) says
“punishable by” not “punished by.” The conviction meets the definition of a felony
under the federal statute.

punishment imposed but the extent to which punishment may be imposed which

controls the point whether the crime is a felony[.]”).

      In determining the maximum punishment provided for by Oklahoma law, we

inquire as to the maximum punishment as of the date of Mr. Maxwell’s predicate

conviction. He was arrested on December 23, 1981, and sentenced on February 16,

1982. Even though the record does not reflect the exact date of conviction for that

crime, the law was constant between the date of arrest and date of sentencing, and

during that entire time frame provided for a maximum punishment of five years of

imprisonment in the penitentiary. Okla. Stat. tit. 21 § 645 (1981); see also Okla.

Stat. tit. 21 § 645 (1982) (reflecting a change in the assault statute that increased the

maximum punishment to ten years of imprisonment in the penitentiary effective April

16, 1982). Thus, Mr. Maxwell was convicted of a crime that was punishable by

26
We are persuaded that under the facts in this particular case this rule is not appropriate and interest should be awarded instead from December 11, 1971, the date of the contract's termination.


27
The allowance of interest in actions for restitution is considered more fully in the Restatement of Restitution, § 156.8  It is there stated that where a person has a duty to pay the value of a benefit which he has received, he is "also under a duty to pay interest upon such value from the time he committed a breach of duty in failing to make restitution", subject to specified conditions.  It is noted in comment a that where restitution awards are based upon rescissions due to fraud or duress, the duty to make restitution arises at the time of the transaction.  Where, however, there is no clear indication that restitution was owed at the outset of the transaction, interest should not start to accrue until the breach of duty requiring restitution has occurred.  This is not inconsistent with the rule stated in Restatement of Contracts § 347(2), which is expressed in discretionary rather than mandatory terms, allowing the court to fix the date from which interest shall run, depending upon the facts of each case and the interests of justice.


28
Any return on Boly's contribution of $30,000 was uncertain, depending on commissions earned and profits realized after the conversion plans were formulated and put into effect.  There was no duty on the part of Schneider to return Boly's investment unless and until the contract was breached.  It is obvious that some of the delay in performance was not caused exclusively by Schneider, but rather was due to the illness and death of E. H. Boly and the subsequent negotiations with other brokers.9  The district court found that appellant "refused to go ahead" with the plans formulated by Poss "or any other proposals and transferred the property back to the bank".  It is not clear exactly when appellant first refused to proceed with the project and thus breached the contract, but the property was not reconveyed to the Bank until July 20, 1972, after the date of the termination of the contract.  From these facts we conclude that the breach of contract and the breach of Schneider's duty to repay the $30,000 occurred when the contract terminated without Schneider having lived up to his obligation to go forward with the project.  Interest should, therefore, accrue from that date.


29
We affirm the judgment except for the date from which interest shall

    Figure 4, however, is limited to disclosing an ar-
rangement in which multiple tea containers can be ac-
cessed individually to add different tea compositions, but
used together for brewing. See ’672 patent col. 7 l. 66-col.
8 l. 13. Figure 4 and its descriptions do not show any
details of entry or exit means in the containers for water
to flow through. From this silence, we cannot assume
Figure 4 to depart from the consistent teachings else-
where in the ’672 patent that water can flow through a
“sealed body” via a “water-permeable material.” We are
therefore not persuaded by Teashot that the district court
erred in construing this claim element.

       II. Summary Judgment of Non-Infringement

    We review a district court’s summary judgment de-

                 A. Literal Infringement

    Literal infringement requires that “every limitation

    Teashot does not dispute that its owner and the in-
ventor of the ’672 patent, in testimonies quoted by Green

permeable. Teashot also does not dispute the following
admission that the mere puncturing of the K-Cup lid fails
to transform the material into a water-permeable materi-

C.
Claimant-appellant Yamamoto's alleged claim arises from an industrial accident on January 21, 1972, approximately ten and a half years prior to his filing a claim for workmen's compensation benefits in 1982. From the time of the alleged incident (chest pains) in 1972 to 1982, none of Yamamoto's doctors told him that his heart attack was caused or aggravated by his work as a mechanic with Schuman Carriage Company. It was in 1982 that a fellow employee first advised Yamamoto that his heart attack might be compensable under the Workers' Compensation Law.

II.
On appeal, claimant-appellants contend that the statute of limitations under HRS § 386-82 was tolled because the employers failed to file WC-1 forms as required by HRS § 386-95.[2] Claimant-appellants further contend that the statute of limitations does not bar the claims because there was no finding by the Board that the employers were prejudiced, as required by HRS § 386-83(b)[3], and that there is a statutory presumption of proper notice and compensability under HRS 386-85.[4] Finally, claimant-appellants contend that lack of knowledge or prejudice to the employer by the untimely claim is a condition precedent to asserting the statute of limitations.

A.
Claimant-appellants argue that the employers' failure to file reports of the injuries tolled the statute of limitations. HRS § 386-95 requires employers to file a WC-1 report of employees' injuries incurred in the course of employment within seven working days after the employer has knowledge of the injury. Failure to do so subjects the employer to a $100 fine and 90 days imprisonment. However, the statute does not state that failure to file the report tolls the statute of limitations set out in HRS § 386-82. There is nothing in any of the statutes to that effect.
*16 Majority of the jurisdictions with similar statutes have held that the penalty against an employer for failure to file a report of the employee's injury is not a tolling of the statute of limitations or a bar to asserting the statute as a defense.

Before ANDERSON, BARKETT and COX, Circuit Judges.

PER CURIAM:

      Albert W. May, III appeals following the district court's dismissal of his federal

claim pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, and the
dismissal without prejudice of his state-law negligence and wantonness claims

pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c).

      May presents several issues on this appeal. First, he contends that his First

Amended Complaint was timely, and that he was entitled to file this amendment

without leave of court because no responsive pleading had been served by the

Defendant. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a). This is a non-issue; the district court's

Memorandum of Opinion (R.1-8) and Order (R.1-9), as amended (R.1-11), address

May's First Amended Complaint, and neither the Memorandum of Opinion nor the

Order suggests that the First Amended Complaint was not properly filed.

      Next, May argues that all claims contained in the First Amended Complaint

relate back to the time the original complaint was filed. The district court's orders,

however, do not address the "relation back" issue. While the Defendant’s memo in

support of its motion to dismiss raised the “relation back” issue, the court decided to

appeals the district court’s order granting summary judgment and

awarding damages and injunctive relief in favor of Discovery

Licensing, Inc. (“Discovery”), in this breach of contract action.

We have reviewed the parties’ briefs and the record on appeal and

find no reversible error in the court’s decision to grant summary

judgment in Discovery’s favor.    To the extent King’s contends that

the affidavits submitted by Discovery in support of its summary

judgment motion did not comply with Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e), we find

that King’s has waived its challenge by failing to file a motion to

strike   the   affidavits   in   the     district   court.    Jones   v.

Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., 69 F.3d 712, 718 (4th Cir. 1995).

We also find no abuse of discretion in the district court’s denial

of King’s’ request to extend discovery pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.

56(f), see Ingle v. Yelton, 439 F.3d 191, 195 (4th Cir. 2006)

1. Timing of the Assessment or Definition of Tax Liability
Amstar claims that its tax liability was "well defined at the time it made its remittance" to the IRS. (Def.Mem. at 4). Amstar contends that its remittance was a payment because, inter alia, Amstar made precise calculations to determine the amount of the tax due, rather than simply making a lump sum payment. (Id. at 4-5, 8-9). The IRS counters that remittances made by a taxpayer and designated as cash deposits prior to the issuance of a notice of deficiency are treated as cash deposits. (Gov't Opp. at 16); see also Rev. Proc. 84-58 at 502, § 4.02 ("A remittance made before the mailing of a notice of deficiency that is designated by the taxpayer in writing as a deposit in the nature of a cash bond will be treated as such by the [IRS].").
At the time of payment by Amstar, by check dated December 13, 1990, Amstar had received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPA") from the IRS, dated August 28, 1990. (Gowan Decl., Ex. 14; Def. *242 Mem. at 4-5).[11] Amstar's remittance was sent before the IRS had audited Amstar's 8908 return, issued a notice of deficiency, or otherwise assessed tax liability. The fact that an assessment had not yet been made suggestsâ  but is not conclusive of the conclusionâ  that the 1990 remittance was a deposit rather than a payment. See, e.g., Crosby v. United States, 889 F.Supp. 143, 146-47 (D.Vt.1995).

2. Amstar's Intent
The cover letter accompanying the remittance check to the IRS states: "We respectfully request that this deposit be identified as a cash bond in your records." (Gowan Decl., Ex. 24). Amstar seeks to diminish the significance of its (own) language by claiming that "Mr. Twenty's letter was simply a cover letter for the check" and "Mr. Twenty was not authorized to waive interest for Amstar." (Def.Mem. at 11). Amstar also asserts that circumstantial evidence would demonstrate an intent to make a payment of tax because Amstar: (i) did not remit the money under protest; (ii) deducted the interest remitted from

V. ORDER
For the foregoing reasons and as set forth above,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion of defendant for summary judgment (Doc. 37) is sustained as to certain issues and otherwise denied.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a status and scheduling hearing is set for Friday, June 20, 2008, at 2:00 p.m.
NOTES
[1]  In her pretrial deposition Denise Harris testified that despite the language of the quitclaim deed she "understood" that she and her husband both owned the Grace Ave. property. She further testified that this belief was based upon financing documents. "I believe sometime when the mortgage come in they acknowledge myself and my husband." Denise Harris added that, "[w]hen I get the mortgage statements or ... [Chase] needs to speak with us, they may put both of our names...."

However, she agreed that all of the available title documents indicate that after the April 20, 2005 quitclaim deed she was the only owner of 3430 Grace Ave., and that after that date Pierre Harris was not an owner of the property. (Doc. 38, Ex. 5 at 9, 10-11, and 13.) Pierre Harris testified during his deposition that he believed he and his wife each owned the Grace Ave. property for investment purposes and in fact had rented it. (Doc. 38, Ex. 9 at 6-8.)
[2]  AMHIC asserts that the formal appraisal process began on October 18, 2006, after the two parties were unable to settle the claim. (Doc. 38, Ex. 14 at 1.)

Plaintiff Yorkshire Condominium Association, Inc., a condominium homeowners' association responsible for the management and maintenance of the common elements of Yorkshire Townhomes, filed this action against defendant Hershiser, owner of a condominium unit of Yorkshire Townhomes, to collect certain condominium assessments or fees, along with interest and attorney fees.
On August 9, 1990, plaintiff moved for summary judgment supported by an affidavit of Michele Young. On September 20, 1990, defendant filed her cross motion for partial summary judgment and for payment of attorney fees. Plaintiff filed a supplemental affidavit of Ms. Young on October 23, 1990, and on October 26, 1990, the affidavit of plaintiff's counsel. On October 29, 1990, defendant filed a brief in support of oral objections made at the summary judgment hearing to plaintiff's use of the supplemental affidavit of Ms. Young and the affidavit of plaintiff's counsel.
The state court granted plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, awarding damages of $1,059.70 in principal, $114.78 in interest, and $5,251.15 in attorney fees for a total judgment of $6,425.63. The defendant's motions for partial summary judgment, attorney fees, and to strike affidavits were denied. Defendant appeals from the grant of plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and from the denial of her motions for partial summary judgment and to strike affidavits. Held:

Citizens & Southern Nat. Bank v. Dorsey, 159 Ga. App. 784, 785 (1) (285 SE2d 242). No such request for an extension of the time within which to file and serve the affidavits having been made in the case sub judice and no finding of excusable neglect in failing to timely file and serve the affidavits having been made by the state court, we must conclude that plaintiff failed to proceed in a manner that would permit the state court to exercise its discretion under OCGA § 9-11-6 (b). It follows that the state court erred in considering (in relation to plaintiff's motion for summary judgment), over defendant
