String com lixo de memória

Estou com alguns problemas ao trabalhar com arquivos e funções, o código que estou fazendo deveria imprimir uma string no arquivo, porém essa string está com lixo, e não imprime o que deve apesar de ser usada normalmente.

I found an working answer here, but my comboboxes are created dynamically by User Action.
Is it possible to fill the Combobox like this programmatically?
The Items I want to display are ModuleCategoryViewControl's :  
public class ClassNameController
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public System.Type ObjectType { get; set; }
    public ClassNameController(string name, Type objectType)
    {
        this.Name = name;
        this.ObjectType = objectType;
    }
    public override string ToString()
    {
        return Name;
    }
}
class ModuleCategoryViewControl : ClassNameController
{
    public string Category { get; set; }
    public ModuleCategoryViewControl(string name, string category, Type objectType) : base(name, objectType)
    {
        this.Category = category;
    }
}

They should group by Category and displayed by Name

Is it possible to fill the Combobox like this programmatically?

The sample code on the link you supplied does fill the ComboBox programmatically so it's unclear what your issue really is. 
If you add items dynamically at runtime you should replace the List<ModuleCategoryViewControl> with an ObservableCollection<ModuleCategoryViewControl>.
Please refer to the following sample code.
Window.xaml.cs:
public partial class MainWindow : Window
{
    readonly ObservableCollection<ModuleCategoryViewControl> items = new ObservableCollection<ModuleCategoryViewControl>();

    public MainWindow()
    {
        InitializeComponent();

        items.Add(new ModuleCategoryViewControl("Item2", "A", typeof(int)));
        items.Add(new ModuleCategoryViewControl("Item2", "A", typeof(int)));
        items.Add(new ModuleCategoryViewControl("Item3", "A", typeof(int)));
        items.Add(new ModuleCategoryViewControl("Item4", "B", typeof(int)));
        items.Add(new ModuleCategoryViewControl("Item5", "B", typeof(int)));

        ListCollectionView lcv = new ListCollectionView(items);
        lcv.GroupDescriptions.Add(new PropertyGroupDescription("Category"));

        comboBox.ItemsSource = lcv;
    

This doesn't make sense, since transport-level security also can use encryption and certificates, so why would using private/public keys at message-level be more secure than using them at transport-level? Namelly, if intermediary is able to intercept SSL traffic, why wouldn't it also be able to intercept messages secured via message-level private/public keys?
thank you

A:

Consider the case of SSL interception.
Generally, if you have an SSL encrypted connection to a server, you can trust that you "really are* connected to that server, and that the server's owners have identified themselves unambiguously to a mutually trusted third party, like Verisign, Entrust, or Thawte (by presenting credentials identifying their name, address, contact information, ability to do business, etc., and receiving a certificate countersigned by the third party's signature). Using SSL, this certificate is an assurance to the end user that traffic between the user's browser (client) and the server's SSL endpoint (which may not be the server itself, but some switch, router, or load-balancer where the SSL certificate is installed) is secure.  Anyone intercepting that traffic gets gobbledygook and if they tamper with it in any way, then the traffic is rejected by the server.
But SSL interception is becoming common in many companies.  With SSL interception, you "ask" for an HTTPS connection to (for example) www.google.com, the company's switch/router/proxy hands you a valid certificate naming www.google.com as the endpoint (so your browser doesn't complain about a name mismatch), but instead of being countersigned by a mutually trusted third party, it is countersigned by their own certificate authority (operating somewhere in the company), which also happens to be trusted by your browser (since it's in your trusted root CA list which the company has control over).
The company's proxy then establishes a separate SSL-encrypted connection to your target site (in this example, www.google.com), but the proxy/switch/router in the middle is now capable of logging all of your traffic.
You still see a lock icon in your browser, since the traffic is encrypted up to your company's inner SSL endpoint using their own certificate, and the traffic is re-encrypted from that endpoint to your final destination using the destination's SSL certificate, but the man in the middle (the proxy/router/

Q:

Running Build-Heap Algorithm on given numbers

I don't fully understand this build-heap function. Lets assume we have array 3, 4, 5, 13, 16, 32. 
It seems like we swap the parent when it is less than the current A[j] but which number does the loop start with? Maybe somebody can go through 2-3 loops and show how the array changes after 1st loop, 2nd loop, 3rd loop. Much appreciated. Oh, also, what would be the runtime?
for i=2 to n
    j = i
    while (j>1) and A[parent(j)]<A[j] do
        swap A(parent(j)] and A[j]
        j = parent(j)

A:

It appears you're building a max-heap, where every element is greater than or equal to its child elements (if any). With that understanding, let's trace the action. First, the parent node of $A[j]$ will be $A[j/2]$ (integer division: discard any remainder) so we'll have
$$\begin{array}{r|cccccccc}
j & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & \dotsc\\
parent(j) & \_ & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 3 & \dotsc
\end{array}$$
To keep things simple, we'll let the initial array be $[3,4,5,13]$:
Insert at $i=2$. 
$A[parent(2)]=A[1]=3 < 4=A[2]$ so we swap $A[1]$ and $A[2]$, giving us the array
$$
[4,3,5,13]
$$
Insert at $i=3$. 
$A[parent(3)]=A[1]=4 < 5=A[3]$ so we swap $A[1]$ and $A[3]$, giving us the array
$$
[5,3,4,13]
$$
Insert at $i=4$. 
$A[parent(4)]=A[2]=3 < 13=A[4]$ so we swap $A[2]$ and $A[3]$, giving us the array
$$
[5,13,4,3]

I have two versions of my model in my project: a version 4 and a version 5. If I set my version 4 as default, it works fine. If I select "Design -> Data Model -> Add Model Version" (as described by this post), make a change, Design -> Data Model -> Set Current Version, build and run, it will fail with the aforementioned "Can't find model for source store" error. Set model back to version 4, no problems, addPersistentStoreWithType. Alternatively, if I add model version and make no changes, simply go from version 4 to 5 without adding any new fields, no problems. If I then try to go from 5 to 6, the aforementioned error.
This code is failing on both Simulator and Phone. I read several prescriptions calling for deleting and reinstalling the app, which does work for both Simulator and Phone, but I am afraid that when I release this to real users it will break my installed base since they won't be able to delete and reinstall - App Store will auto-upgrade them. 
This code worked in releases past with no changes on my part - hence my ability to make it all the way up to version 4. I recently upgraded to XCode 3.2.3 building for iOS4, which may have something to do with this. 
Is anyone else having this issue all of a sudden now like I am? Has anyone managed to work past it? Thanks.

I want to cut to be like this below.
ABC_DEF_G-1_P-249_

I use this awk command to do that like below.
ls -lrt |  grep -i .CSV | tail -1 | awk -F ' ' '{print $8}' | cut -c 1-18

Question is, if the number 1, is growing, how to make the substring is dynamic
example like below...
ABC_DEF_G-1_P-249_
....
ABC_DEF_G-10_P-249_
ABC_DEF_G-11_P-249_
...
ABC_DEF_G-1000_P-249_

A:

To display the file names of all .CSV without everything after the last underscore, you can do this:
for fname in *.CSV; do echo "${fname%_*}_"; done

This removes the last underscore and evertyhing that follows it (${fname%_*}), and then appends an underscore again. You can assign that, for example, to another variable.
For an example file list of
ABC_DEF_G-1_P-249_9.CSV
ABC_DEF_G-10_P-249_8.CSV
ABC_DEF_G-1000_P-249_4.CSV
ABC_DEF_G-11_P-249_7.CSV
ABC_DEF_G-11_P-249_7.txt

this results in
$ for fname in *.CSV; do echo "${fname%_*}_"; done
ABC_DEF_G-1_P-249_
ABC_DEF_G-10_P-249_
ABC_DEF_G-1000_P-249_
ABC_DEF_G-11_P-249_

A:

You can do this with just ls and grep
 ls -1rt | grep -oP ".*(?=_\d{1,}\.CSV)"

If you are concerned about the output of ls -1, as mentioned in the comments you can use find as well
find -type f -printf "%f\n" | grep -oP ".*(?=_\d{1,}\.CSV)"

Q:

using pointers in c programming

I have a problem with pointers in c programming. I would love to get variables from the command line in Linux and than be assigning the value of the variables from command line to a non pointer variable and printing them out! 
char *argv[]
this is the function that takes everything written after the name of the c program on the command line and stores it in the pointer *argv[]; Now i would love to store these pointer values in a normal variable and print it on the command line. I get segmentation fault when i execute my code.
int main ( int argc, char *argv[] )
{

    char r1;
    char a = *argv[1];
    char b = *argv[2];
    char c = *argv[3];

    if ( b == '+') {

    r1 = a + c;
    printf("%s", r1);
    }
}

A:

printf("%s", r1);

This is where your segfault is coming from.  
The %s conversion specifier expects its corresponding argument to have type char * and to be the address of the first element of a zero-terminated array of char.  r1 is the result of adding the values in a and c, which is not going to be a valid address.  
C is not Python or Javascript - values are not magically converted between numbers and strings based on context.  If you want to work with numeric values from the command line, you must first manually convert the string representations of those values to their corresponding types.  
For example, if your command line is ./foo 1, then argv[1] contains the string "1" (represented as the sequence {'1', 0}).  The value of *argv[1] is not 1, it's the encoding value of the character '1', which, assuming ASCII, is 49.  You need to use a library function like atoi() or strtol() to convert the string "1" to the integer value 1.  
Assuming your input is something like
./foo 1 + 2

and you want it to print 3, then you need to do something like the following:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main( int argc, char **argv )
{
  if ( argc < 4 )


created directly from the f10g file, just as a test.
The temporary test colors are
  /* --- colorkey --- */
  int colorkey[99] = {
          0*256 +  4,           /* sea surface and below is 4=blue */
        100*256 + 11,           /* up to 100m is 11=green */
        250*256 +  5,           /* up to 250m is yellow */
        500*256 + 10,           /*  500 maroon */
       1000*256 +  2,           /* 1000 red */
       2500*256 +  8,           /* 2500 gray */
      10000*256 +  9,           /* rest silver */
                  -1 };

The eventual goal, which really isn't that much more complicated,
is to generate a gif animation, where each successive frame shows
what happens when sea level rises, say, another foot.
In any case, a quick glance at the gif suggests that my naive interpretation of the data's lat,lon grid is, in all likelihood, generally more-or-less correct. And I probably don't need anything more accurate/precise for the intended purpose. But it would be nice (and I'd still like) to have more thorough documentation than what's cited above. Anybody have that info, or just a link to it would be great. Thanks.
     E d i t # 2  ------------------ 
Just to illustrate the intended use, below's an animation, focusing on the Florida region of the f10g tile. Each successive frame raises sea level (actually, lowers the elevation of each land pixel, leaving ocean unchanged) by one meter. The first frame is raw data, and there are 30 frames in all, and then repeat. Of course, one meter times 30 is kind of extreme, but the NOAA data's in meters, so I don't immediately have any finer vertical resolution available. And it's just a prototype illustration (but I know where I'm buying my retirement home:).

The colortable/colorkey is also different than the first gif above,
with light_green-->dark_green for the first twelve meters, and then yellow up to 100 meters, as follows
  int colorkey2[99] = {
          0*256 +  0,           /* sea surface and below is 0=blue */
          1*256 +  

            // Bail if there are no dependencies for some reason.
            if ( empty( $dependency_object->deps ) ) {
                return;
            }

            // Do the handle removal.
            foreach ( $dependency_object->deps as $dep_key => $handle ) {
                if ( in_array( $handle, $handles_to_remove ) ) {
                    unset( $dependency_object->deps[ $dep_key ] );
                    $dependency_object->deps = array_values( $dependency_object->deps );  // "reindex" array
                    $handles_updated = true;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // If we have updated the handles, dequeue the relevant dependencies which
    // were enqueued separately Elementor\Frontend.
    if ( $handles_updated ) {
        wp_dequeue_script( 'elementor-dialog' );
        wp_deregister_script( 'elementor-dialog' );
    }
}

By modifying elementor-frontend before dequeueing elementor-dialog, we will not unintentionally dequeue elementor-frontend when we dequeue elementor-dialog.
When testing this code, I inspected the $wp_scripts global (via wp_scripts()) to ensure that the desired results took effect. E.g.
$scripts = wp_scripts();
print_r( $scripts ); 

Relevant part of $scripts before modification:

{
    private UdpClient _udpClient;

    public BaseUdpReceiver()
    {

    public void Start()
    {
        _udpClient = new UdpClient()

            EnableBroadcast = true
        };
        _udpClient.Client.SetSocketOption(SocketOptionLevel.Socket, SocketOptionName.ReuseAddress, true);

        _udpClient.BeginReceive(OnUdpDataReceived, _udpClient);
        Debug.WriteLine($">>> started receiving");

    private static void OnUdpDataReceived(IAsyncResult result)

        var udpClient = result.AsyncState as UdpClient;

They've been going out a week; I mean, that's not (a) serious (relationship).  

I wondered if she was speaking correctly, which is presumable, since she was a native American English speaker. But more often I here the for when people talk about duration. So is it also possible to leave out for? Maybe only in the informal register? 
EDIT: There was a heavy stress on the word week. Does it play a role in this matter?
EDIT#2: ... OK. It's more suitable as an answer.

A:

Short answer: I would say that for can  be omitted, but everyone may not agree with me.  Its felicity may depend on context. 
My answer focuses on the question you overheard, but my comments apply also to the question in your title ('I've been doing this (for) a week'). 

As a native speaker (AmE), I tend to think that whether for is necessary depends on the construction, context, and current usage, as well of course on the speaker's dialect or idiolect. 
I certainly would rarely say 

[Can you] wait for a second/a minute, I need to tie my shoe. 

I would omit for in the sentence above. This is true whether I express it as an imperative (not using can you) or a question. Ngrams seems to back me up on this:

A search using second in both phrases returns a flat line (comparatively zero results) for the expression with for. 
Another construction where the omission of for seems well suited is 

I'm gone ten minutes/two days and (come back) and this is what happens? 

Again, a short(er) period of time seems to work better here. 
Thus 

They've been going out a week and this is what happens?

seems fine. 
As for the original sentence

They've been going out a week; I mean, that's not (a) serious (relationship), 

in general, it might sound better with some qualifier such as only or now:

They've been going out a week now; I mean, that's not (a) serious (relationship).

You know, a lot depends on delivery (how it is said). 
If it is said with no stress on any word or meaningful pauses in delivery, it seems a

According to this question, we can modify the source and it's not called interference:

you can modify the stream elements themselves and it should not be called as "interference".

According to this question, the code
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
  list.add("test");
  list.forEach(x -> list.add(x));

will throw ConcurrentModificationException.
But my code,
Employee[] arrayOfEmps = {
                new Employee(1, "Jeff Bezos"),
                new Employee(2, "Bill Gates"),
                new Employee(3, "hendry cavilg"),
                new Employee(4, "mark cuban"),
                new Employee(5, "zoe"),
                new Employee(6, "billl clinton"),
                new Employee(7, "ariana") ,
                new Employee(8, "cathre"),
                new Employee(9, "hostile"),
                new Employee(10, "verner"),
            };
        Employee el=new Employee(1, "Jeff Bezos");
        List<Employee> li=Arrays.asList(arrayOfEmps);
        li.stream().map(s->{s.setName("newname");return s;}).forEach(System.out::print);

doesn't throw ConcurrentModificationException, even though it in fact changes the source.
And this code,
Employee[] arrayOfEmps = {
                new Employee(1, "Jeff Bezos"),
                new Employee(2, "Bill Gates"),
                new Employee(3, "hendry cavilg"),
                new Employee(4, "mark cuban"),
                new Employee(5, "zoe"),
                new Employee(6, "billl clinton"),
                new Employee(7, "ariana") ,

            };
        Employee el=new Employee(1, "Jeff Bezos");

// Connect
export default connect(
  mapStateToProps,
  mapDispatchToProps
)(SignUp);

Dumb component
const SignUp = ({ inputChange }) => (
  <input
    type="password"
    placeholder="Password"
    onChange={inputChange('password')}
  />
);

Maybe some parts of this code seems a little strange because I removed some of my types to not add extra pointless code.
Anyway the error come from the mapDispatchToProps, it seems like it's ok with a single fat arrow but when I start to chain them I get this error (even if they return an object).

A:

As the error mentioned actions must be plain objects but when you chain the functions, you are actually passing a function (the next one on the chain) and not an object.
The problem here for you is that you want to pass an extra argument in addition to the actual DOM event, like the name of the input, i.e: "password", "user" etc...
Then why not just give the input a name and grab it in the action creator function (same as you do with the value attribute).
Your form can look something like this:  
const Form = ({ inputChange, form }) => (

);

const mapState = state => ({
  form: state
});

const mapDispatch = {
  inputChange
};

const ConnectedForm = connect(
  mapState,
  mapDispatch
)(Form);

And inside your action creator:
const inputChange = ({ target }) => ({
  type: INPUT_CHANGE,
  payload: {
    value: target.value,
    inputName: target.name
  }
});

and your reducer can handle it, something like this:  
const reducer = (state = {user: '', password: ''}, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case INPUT_CHANGE: {
      const { inputName, value } = action.payload;
      return {


$id = $_GET["id"]; //ID OF THE CURRENT CONTACT
$user = $_GET["user"];  //ID OF THE CURRENT USERS

$query = mysql_query("SELECT name FROM contacts WHERE contact_id='". mysql_real_escape_string( $id ) ."' and user_id='1';");

$retval = mysql_fetch_object($query)->name;

$retval = trim($retval);
echo $retval;
?>

This is much easier isn't it?
$sql_insert = 
"INSERT INTO customers (        
`name`,
`address`,
`email`,
`phone`
) 
VALUES (        
'$name',
'$address',     
'$email',
'$phone'
)";

A:

Is it this you're looking for? Even your question in German isn't that clear to me :
$field = 'name';
$query = mysql_query("SELECT $field FROM contacts WHERE contact_id='". mysql_real_escape_string( $id ) ."' and user_id='1';");
$retval = mysql_fetch_object($query)->$field;

A:

You can usi it something like this. Currently i assume you get only one row back and want to use only one field.
<?php
require_once 'config.php';

$id = $_GET["id"]; //ID DES DERZEITIGEN KONTAKTES
$user = $_GET["user"];  //ID DES DERZEITIGEN USERS

//Use variable inside closures `` and just in case escape it, depends how you get variable
$query = mysql_query("SELECT `".mysql_real_escape_string($variable)."` FROM contacts WHERE contact_id='". mysql_real_escape_string( $id ) ."' and user_id='1';");

if (!$query) {
    echo 'Could not run query: ' . mysql_error();
    exit;
}
$row = mysql_fetch_row($query); //Retriev first row, with multiple rows use mysql_fetch_assoc
$retval = $row['0']; //Retriev first field

$retval = trim($retval); 
echo $retval;
?>

Q:

Can I use the phrase, “open and shut” for other subjects than legal cases?

There was the following passage in New York Times (April 28) under the title,
“In Baltimore, we’re all Freddie Gray.”:

“We’ve watched as Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, in conjunction with
  Police Commissioner Anthony W. Batts, spent over a week investigating
  what appears to be an open-and-shut case. I’d like to think that if I
  broke a person’s neck for no reason, I’d be charged in minutes. But
  the system — even when it’s run by a black mayor and a majority of the
  City Council is black — protects the police, no matter how blatant and
  brutal they are.

As I am unfamiliar with the expression,“open and shut,” I searched the meaning on Google, and found the following definition by the Free Dictionary among several sources:

Open and shut - If a legal case or problem is open and shut, the facts
  are very clear and it is easy to make a decision or find a solution

Is the usage of idiom, “open and shut” limited to legal matters? If it came from the instantaneous action of opening and shutting something like a box or drawer, why can’t we use it on anything, questions (e.g. simple calculation) or problems that are manifest or easy to solve other than legal cases? 

A:

An expression generally , but not exclusively, used referring to legal matters :
Open-and-shut case:

a legal case or other matter that is easy to decide or solve. (Oxford Learner's)

Open-and-shut case

a simple and straightforward situation without complications. (Often said of criminal cases where the evidence is convincing.)

The murder trial was an open-and-shut case. The defendant was caught with the murder weapon. Bob's death was an open-and-shut case of suicide. He left a suicide note.

The Free Dictionary

Chevrolet presents an open-and-shut case   against the van you are using. ( From LIFE 12 giu 1970)

An open and shut case?: Title of an article with political content.

Examining Binary File for Information using Bit Masks

I have been given the following programming task (edited to obscure mission-specifics):

The raw (binary) file (needed for Phase II implementation) can be interrogated to detect if pods are present.  Format is dependent on the source of the file – FormatX vs. FormatY.  Using a wordsize of 16 bits, the following bit masks can be used to determine presence of pods from the file:

Word #  Mask    Value   Indicates
1       0xFF00  0x8700  Little Endian (Format X)
1       0x00FF  0x0087  Big Endian (Format Y)
13      0x0200  0x0200  right pod installed (Format X)
13      0x0002  0x0002  right pod installed (Format Y)
13      0x0100  0x0100  left pod installed (Format X)
13      0x0001  0x0001  left pod installed (Format Y)

How I have approached this problem so far: I have the file on my local file system, so I use System.IO.File.OpenRead to get it into a Stream object. I want to read through the stream 16 bits/2 bytes at a time. For the first "word" of this size, I try applying bitmasks to detect what format I am dealing with. Then I skip forward to the 13th "word" and based on that format, detect right/left pods.
Here's some preliminary code I have written that is not working. I know the file I am reading should be Format Y but my check is not working.
int chunksRead = 0;
int readByte;
while ((readByte = stream.ReadByte()) >= 0)
{
    chunksRead++;

    if (chunksRead == 1)
    {
        // Get format
        bool isFormatY = (readByte & 0x00FF) == 0x0087;
    }
    else if (chunksRead == 13)
    {
        // Check pods
    }
    else if (chunksRead > 13)
    {
        break;
    }
}

Can anyone see what's wrong with my implementation? How should I account for the 2 byte wordsize?
Edit based on response from @Daniel Hilgar

My question:
I am new to Neo4j and trying to create a query listing nodes and relationships into a graph with keyword as "id=0001" as below:
(a) - [id:'0001', ref_id:null] -> (b) - [id:'0002', ref_id:'0001'] -> (c) - [id:'0003', ref_id:'0002'] -> (d)
Start Node will be (a) since it has relationship with id=0001
But the database also exists relationships which I don't want:
(a) - [id:'2001', ref_id:null] -> (b) - [id:'2002', ref_id:'2001'] -> (c)
(a) - [id:'3001', ref_id:null] -> (b) - [id:'3002', ref_id:'3001'] -> (c)
The result should only includes:
(a)-[0001]-(b)-[0002, 0001]-(c)-[0003,0002]-(d)
Below are what I was thinking before write question:
I know how to create this query in SQL database like Oracle and MySQL, I can use query with "where" condition. For example:
Select * 
from table_a parent, (select * from table_a) child 
where child.ref_id = parent.id

Then I can loop the result set in Java to find all relationships. But this is stupid.
I think the query should looks like:
Match (n)-[r:RELTYPE]->(m) WHERE {some conditions at here} RETURN n,r,m

Please help me, thank you!
Yufan

A:

You could either use named relationships and filter in WHERE clause:
match p = (a)-[r1:TYPE]->(b)-[r2:TYPE2]->(c)
where r1.id='0001' and r2.id='0002' and r2.ref_id='0001'
return p

Please note that properties having null value are not allowed in Neo4j. So the first relationship won't have a ref_id.
For the above notation is a shortcut by putting the conditions into the match:
match p = (a)-[r1:TYPE {id:'0001'}]->(b)-[r2

I have an issue with a string containing the plus sign (+).
I want to split that string (or if there is some other way to solve my problem)
string ColumnPlusLevel = "+-J10+-J10+-J10+-J10+-J10";
string strpluslevel = ""; 
strpluslevel = ColumnPlusLevel; 
string[] strpluslevel_lines = Regex.Split(strpluslevel, "+");

foreach (string line in strpluslevel_lines)
{
    MessageBox.Show(line);
    strpluslevel_summa = strpluslevel_summa + line;
}   

MessageBox.Show(strpluslevel_summa, "summa sumarum");

The MessageBox is for my testing purpose.
Now... The ColumnPlusLevel string can have very varied entry but it is always a repeated pattern starting with the plus sign.
i.e. "+MJ+MJ+MJ" or "+PPL14.1+PPL14.1+PPL14.1" as examples.
(It comes form Another software and I cant edit the output from that software)
How can I find out what that pattern is that is being repeated?
That in this exampels is the +-J10 or +MJ or +PPL14.1
In my case above I have tested it by using only a MessageBox to show the result but I want the repeated pattering stored in a string later on.
Maybe im doing it wrong by using Split, maybe there is another solution.
Maybe I use Split in the wrong way.
Hope you understand my problem and the result I want.
Thanks for any advice.
/Tomas

A:

How can I find out what that pattern is that is being repeated?

Maybe i didn't understand the requirement fully, but isn't it easy as:
string[] tokens = ColumnPlusLevel.Split(new[]{'+'}, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);
string first = tokens[0];
bool repeatingPattern = tokens.Skip(1).All(s => s == first);

If repeatingPattern is true you know that the pattern itself is first.

Can you maybe explain how the logic works

The line which contains tokens.Skip(1) is a LINQ query, so you need to add using System.Lin

$new_category = 1;

foreach ($ndeshjet->row as $entry) {

      $category = $entry['category'];
        if ($category  <> $new_category){

             echo $category_name."</br>";   
             $new_category = $category;
        } else {
             $entry_name  = $entry['entry_name'];
             echo "----".$entry_name."</br>";       
        }
}

but the result is :

----A1
----A2
----A3
CatB
CatB
CatB
CatC

As an alternative, you could gather all the values first inside an array and make the category name as key pushing same keys inside. After thats

It is quite possible to determine all polynomials that satisfy the given integral equation. Let $p_n(x)= a_0+a_1 x+\cdots a_n x^n = \sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k$. Substituting in we get
$$\int_1^2 \left(\sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^{2k} \right)^2 dx+5 \int_2^3 \sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^{2k}dx+7\int_3^4 \sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k dx=\frac{1871}{30}.$$
Now it is a matter of choosing your $n$, expanding, integrating and explicitly writing down the equation. For $n=0$ we get (as mentioned in my comment)
$$a_0^2+12a_0=1871/30.$$
For $n=1$ we first get
$$\int_1^2 (a_0^2+2a_0a_1x^2+a_1^2x^4) dx + 5\int_2^3 (a_0 + a_1 x^2) dx+7 \int_3^4 (a_0+a_1x)dx = \frac{1871}{30},$$
or after integrating and collecting terms,
$$a_0^2 + 2a_0a_1 (8-1)/3+a_1^2 (32-1)/5+5a_0+5a_1(27-8)/3+7a_0+7a_1(16-9)/2 = 1871/30$$
or
$$a_0^2+a_0a_1 \frac{14}{3}+a_1^2 \frac{31}{5}+12 a_0 + \left(\frac{19\cdot 5}{3} + \frac{49}{2} \right) a_1 = \frac{1871}{30}.$$
Setting $a_0=0$ we verify that
$$\frac{31}{5}+\frac{19\cdot 5}{3} + \frac{49}{2} = \frac{1871}{30}$$
so that $f(x)=x$ is a solution.

    // If first name or last name equals 'test', Lead Status should equal Disqualified.
    for (Lead myLeads : Trigger.new) {
        if (((myLeads.FirstName != null) || (myLeads.LastName != null)) && 
           (myLeads.FirstName.equalsIgnoreCase('test') ||
            myLeads.LastName.equalsIgnoreCase('test'))) {
                myLeads.Status = 'Disqualified';
        }
    }
}

As it is, when I tried to create a lead with the first name blank / null, I'm getting an error message:
LeadDisqualification: execution of BeforeInsert caused by: System.NullPointerException: Attempt to de-reference a null object Trigger.LeadDisqualification: line 6, column 1

However, I was able to create the lead with the first name null with no issues when I updated line 5 by removing:
(myLeads.LastName != null)

I basically changed line 5 from:
        if (((myLeads.FirstName != null) || (myLeads.LastName != null)) && 
           (myLeads.FirstName.equalsIgnoreCase('test') ||
            myLeads.LastName.equalsIgnoreCase('test'))) {

to
    if (((myLeads.FirstName != null)) && 
       (myLeads.FirstName.equalsIgnoreCase('test') ||
        myLeads.LastName.equalsIgnoreCase('test'))) {

Does anyone know why removing myLeads.LastName != null would cause the null pointer exception error message to go away? Just trying to understand this!

A:

Note that there is a null safe way to compare values in a case insensitive manner:
for (Lead record : records)
{
    if (record.FirstName == 'test' || record.LastName == 'TEST')
    {
        // the == operator performs case-insensitive comparison
        // it is also null safe
        // the left or right operand can be null
    }
}

Regardless, from a logical perspective it is useful to know how to properly perform two separate null checks here.
You should use an and join for each field. Let's consider separate loops. You would do:

Here is the problem:
I want to show the user the best route to reach a marker after the user presses a button inside the infoWindow. The problem is, I can't get the marker's Location data due to some problem with Latlng and Position classes. (I am using the Mapbox example to get the route, so I need two Position values)
So basically, I need to update the variable Destination with the marker's position by clicking a button inside the custom infowindow. Yet I have no idea how can I do that even though going through a lot on searching Google and Stack Overflow. Can someone help me? (Cammack!) Thanks a bunch for the help!

in Rails, database call works in development but stalls in test

I am running a test for a controller method as shown below:
it "should assigns an instance var @items including my item" do
  @item = FactoryGirl.create(:item)
  get :index
  response.should include(@item)
end

The controller method is:
def index
  @Item = Item.select_items
end 

where select_items is a scope method in the Items model:
scope :select_items, where(Items.arel_table[:select_field].not_eq(nil))

In development, this works fine.  In test however, I get 

A 500 error when I test the controller method itself in the console
No error when I simply test the model method in the console
A permanent hang when I run the spec

In test.log, the hang happens at the last line of the following:

If I run the test in rspec, the spec stops at this point.  Why?

Does Slick handle a collection like List/Set etc?

My question is:
My Scala's case class has parameters where a collection(i.e., List) is a part of its constructor parameters, and I wonder how to map my case class into Slick style database table or tables if necessary?
In other words, I would like to "Join tables in Slick way to map to a Json formatted case class, which is to be represented to the frontend (javascript) bits"?
Please kindly give me a shout if my question is not clear enough.
The same question is at:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/scalaquery/QqZz_M-1VTg
For example,
case class ClassA (id: Int, lists: List[ClassB])

    object ClassA extends TableQuery(new ClassATable(_)) {

      // JSON formatter

        implicit val classAFormat: Format[ClassA] = (
            (JsPath \ "id").formatNullable[Int] and
              (JsPath \ "lists").format[List[ClassB]]
            )(ClassA.apply, unlift(ClassA.unapply))
        }

    case class ClassB (id: Int, name: String)

    object ClassB extends TableQuery(new ClassBTable(_)) {
    implicit val classBFormat: Format[ClassB] = (
                (JsPath \ "id").formatNullable[Int] and
                  (JsPath \ "name").format[String]
                )(ClassB.apply, unlift(ClassB.unapply))
            }

So, the missing bit is to create ClassATable and ClassBTable in such a way that there is a bi-directional relationship by means of each one's "id"?
Many thanks,

A:

A class like this
case class ClassA (id: Int, lists: List[ClassB]) implies that table B has to be loaded when Table A is loaded. This hard-codes the loading strategy. This is avoided in idiomatic Slick code. Instead, in Slick this is usually solved with tuples to make it more flexible. The Slick tables are then simply mapped to versions of ClassA and ClassB, which do NOT contain references to each other, only the column data. Instead, a

How to use UICollectionViewController in storyboard while still supporting ios 5.1?

It is a best practice to detect if a certain feature's class exists and degrade user's features depending on availability. I created UICollectionView in storyboard and a standard tableview to support ios 5.1 users. I then simply check if the user has this feature and segue to the appropriate scene. However, when I now try to compile my code I get a "dyld: Symbol not found: _UICollectionElementKindSectionHeader" This seems very anti-pattern of apple to not allow ios6.0 features in storyboard with a ios 5.1 deployment target. 
if ([UICollectionView class]) {
    [self performSegueWithIdentifier:@"UserShow" sender:self];
} else {
    [self performSegueWithIdentifier:@"UserShowTable" sender:self];
}

The above seems like a pretty reasonable approach to me...

A controller is designed to provide the same functionality as UICollectionController of iOS 6 but still supports to iOS 4/5 
What developer is telling

PSTCollectionView Open Source, 100% API compatible replacement of
  UICollectionView for iOS4.3+
You want to use UICollectionView, but still need to support iOS4/5?
  Then you'll gonna love this project. I've originally written it for
  PSPDFKit, my iOS PDF framework that supports text selection and
  annotations, but this project seemed way to useful for others to to
  keep it for myself :) Plus, I would love the influx of new gridviews
  to stop. Better just write layout managers and build on a great
  codebase.
The goal is to use PSTCollectionView on iOS 4/5 as a fallback and
  switch to UICollectionView on iOS6. We even use certain runtime tricks
  to create UICollectionView at runtime for older versions of iOS.
  Ideally, you just link the files and everything works on older
  systems. Practically, it's not that easy, and especially when you're
  using subclasses of UICollectionView-classes

    return np.random.multivariate_normal(means, covs, N)

data = [('Week %d' % (i%10), np.random.rand(), chr(65+np.random.randint(5)), i) for i in range(100)]
sample_data = hv.NdOverlay({i: hv.Points(gen_samples(np.random.randint(1000, 5000), r2))
                            for _, r2, _, i in data})

The real magic begins here. First off, we set up a scatterplot using the hv.Scatter object. 
points = hv.Scatter(data, ['Date', 'r2'], ['block', 'id']).redim.range(r2=(0., 1))

Then, we create a Selection1D stream. It pulls in points from the points object.
stream = Selection1D(source=points)

We then create a function to display the regression plot on the right. There's an empty plot that is the "default", and then there's a callback that hv.DynamicMap calls on.
empty = (hv.Points(np.random.rand(0, 2)) * hv.Curve(np.random.rand(0, 2))).relabel('No selection')

def regression(index):
    if not index:
        return empty
    scatter = sample_data[index[0]]
    xs, ys = scatter['x'], scatter['y']
    slope, intercep, rval, pval, std = stats.linregress(xs, ys)
    xs = np.linspace(*scatter.range(0)+(2,))
    reg = slope*xs+intercep
    return (scatter * hv.Curve((xs, reg))).relabel('r2: %.3f' % slope)

Now, we create the DynamicMap which dynamically loads the regression curve data.
reg = hv.DynamicMap(regression, kdims=[], streams=[stream])

# Ignoring annotation for average - it is not relevant here.    
average = hv.Curve(points, 'Date', 'r2').aggregate(function=np.mean)

Finally, we display the plots.
points * average + reg


Why did the gods send the flood in The Epic of Gilgamesh?

A previous question asks about the comparative timescale of the flood story that appears in the Book of Genesis and the one that appears in the Epic of Gilgamesh. An interesting apparent difference is that Noah was told to save himself by the same God who sent the flood, while Utnapishtim was told by Enki (Ea) who was only one of many gods.
In the Biblical flood, God wishes to destroy both humanity and the earth, because of the corruption and violence that had engulfed both due to the evil of humans (Genesis 6:9). Was there a similar motivation for the Mesopotamian flood myth? Did the gods (presumably plural) wish to destroy both humanity and the earth, or only the former, and was it because of the evil of people? Did they all sanction Utnapishtim's survival as a "good man", or was he more of a "rebel" against the will of the gods?

A:

In the "standard version" of the Babylonian epic (see the translation by Andrew George, Penguin, 1999), it is not very clear. After the gods discover that Uta-napishti has survived the flood, Ea upbraids Enlil for sending the flood without first talking to the other gods (emphasis mine):

Instead of your causing the Deluge,
     a lion could have risen, and diminished the people!
  Instead of your causing the Deluge,
     a wolf could have risen, and diminished the people!
  Instead of your causing the Deluge,
     a famine could have happened, and slaughtered the land!
  Instead of your causing the Deluge,
     the Plague God could have risen, and slaughtered the land!

Apparently, Enlil send the flood to "diminish the people". But this raises another question: Why did Enlil want to "diminish" the people in the first place?
The standard version of the epic keeps silent on this matter, so we need to turn to another Babylonian story, namely the The Epic of Atraḥasis (sometimes spelled Atram-hasis). This story tells us that the gods created man in order to delegate the hard work to them: "Create a human being, that he bear the yoke".
Andrew George writes in the introduction

I am working on the following problem: 
Let $k$ be a field, let $d$ be a positive integer, and let $P_d$ be the $k$-vector space of polynomials of degree $\leq d$ in $k[x,y]$. Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the linear transformation $x\frac{d}{dx} - y\frac{d}{dy} : P_d \longrightarrow P_d$. 
So far in my Linear Algebra class, we've only computed eigenvalues and eigenvectors of linear transformations from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$ by considering the associated $n \times n$ matrix so far. Thus, I wasn't sure exactly how to approach this one. 
But, I tried approaching this just like the other problems we've done. So, in order to find the eigenvalues, we want to find $\lambda \in k$ such that $Tf = \lambda f$, where $f$ is a (nonzero) function in $k[x,y]$ (which would serve as an eigenvector) and $T$ is the linear transformation specified above. This gives *$x\frac{df}{dx} - y\frac{df}{dy} = \lambda f$. 
How can I now solve equation * for eigenvalues and the associated eigenvectors ? Am I supposed to solve a corresponding differential equation? Even this is tough for me, since I'm not used to solving differential equations for functions in two variables. Or is there an easier approach that I'm not seeing? 
I wouldn't think that I'm supposed to expand $f$ out to include all of its terms and solve from there -- this can get cumbersome since we're dealing with the polynomial ring in two variables $k[x,y]$. 
Any help is appreciated. Thanks! 

A:

Consider a general $d$ dimensional polynomial
$$ f(x,y) = \sum_{i=0}^d \sum_{j=0}^d a_{ij} x^i y^j. $$
Plugging into our linear operator we obtain
$$ \sum_{i=0}^d \sum_{j=0}^d (i-j -\lambda) a_{ij} x^i y^j = 0. $$
Since this needs to hold for each coefficient of $x^i y^j$, we require $(i-j -\lambda)

And this was not what I was expecting - I was expecting to get the same as I did in teh parent document.
Can anyone explain to me why this is happening and how to fix it so that the array is still an array when addressed from a child window/document?
PS. the objects aren't added to the array as stated above, they are added like this:
function objTemp()
{
    this.Id = '';
    this.Name = '';
};

var myArray = [];

var obj = new ObjTemp();
obj.Id = 'guid1';
obj.Name = 'name1';

myArray[myArray.length] = obj;

If that makes any difference.
Any help would be much appreciated, both for fixing my problem but also for better understanding what is going on :)

A:

The very last line might be causing the problem, have you tried replacing myArray[myArray.length] = obj; with myArray.push(obj);? Could be that, since you're creating a new index explicitly, the Array is turned into an object... though I'm just guessing here. Could you add the code used by the child document that retrieves myArray ?
Edit
Ignore the above, since it won't make any difference. Though, without wanting to boast, I was thinking along the right lines. My idea was that, by only using proprietary array methods, the interpreter would see that as clues as to the type of myArray. The thing is: myArray is an array, as far as the parent document is concerned, but since you're passing the Array from one document to another, here's what happens: 
An array is an object, complete with it's own prototype and methods. By passing it to another document, you're passing the entire Array object (value and prototype) as one object to the child document. In passing the variable between documents, you're effectively creating a copy of the variable (the only time JavaScript copies the values of a var). Since an array is an object, all of its properties (and prototype methods/properties) are copied to a 'nameless' instance of the Object object. Something along the lines of var copy = new Object(toCopy.constructor(toCopy.valueOf())); is happening... the easiest way around this, IMO, is to stringency the array withing the parent context, because there, the interpreter

Q:

Is the D&D Pantheon as invincible as it appears?

I've recently taking up the ill-advised task of skimming Deities and Demigods. Numerous times throughout this book, the idea of PCs killing off the gods is entertained. For example, page 31 says that a sufficiently high level Epic party may have an easy time defeating the deities in the book and page 220 has a section devoted to deicide.
I can see this being possible for some pantheons. Numerous members of the Asgardian pantheon are quite weak and almost all of them lack Alter Reality, the Olympian pantheon's Nike and Hercules stand out as targets (low Divine Rank and no Alter Reality), and you might have a shot at the weaker members of the Pharaonic pantheon (e.g. Imhotep is DR 1, lacks any instant-kills, and is level 20 Expert). For these cases, I can at least see what the designers were going for.
The thing is, I just don't think that this is possible if the DM is using the D&D Pantheon. With the sole exception of the web extension deity Erbin, every single deity in this pantheon has Alter Reality. In my opinion, even under a strict RAW reading of its benefits (i.e. the Notes section), anyone who has this Salient Divine Ability is invincible. I can't even see how another deity can kill them.
To support this point, this is how I envision a battle between anyone who has Alter Reality and anyone else:

Before the battle, the deity makes use of its immortality, access to any Divination spell it wants (via Alter Reality), and (usually high) intelligence score to access any of a number of exploits for moving first.
As soon as the deity becomes aware of a battle or an upcoming battle, the deity moves first and uses Alter Reality to cast Persistent Time Stop. It now has an entire day to prepare for the fight. If that's not enough, it casts it again and again until it is enough.
Given that the deity has Alter Reality, it can do pretty much anything to prepare for the battle. My favorite is dropping an arbitrarily high mass on top of the opponent, but I'm sure that the ability to create temporary magic objects is even more useful (scrolls, any one?). The only limitations are those

adding comments using php and html

I was wondering if there were any kind people out there who would be able to help me with my php conundrum! Im very very new to php and I can't quite understand how to add a comment section that is functional. I have made a database table (named 'comments') to store all of the comments that users will submit. I am not sure of these things:
1. how to connect the comment section (on php page - home.php) to my database table (comments)
2. how to make the comments that people post be posted onto the the same page - home.php
I have done something wrong as now when I type in the URL this error comes up
Parse error: syntax error, unexpected '{', expecting '(' in .../home.php on line 34

Anyway I hope someone can help me!
Thanks

UPDATE: The problematic line of code is
 $(dialogId).load('http://localhost:24533/Admin/BlogPostEdit?id=' + rowid, function () {

After you do jQuery.load() the jqGrid's programmatic reload binding call trigger("reloadGrid") doesn't work anymore. The only way to reload the data that works after you do jQuery.load() is the reload button in the toolbar. I still don't know how to fix it.
UPDATE2 (solution): The problem was in HTML returned from jQuery.ajax() it was a full HTML page with HTML head and body tags. After server side started to return only the form jqGrid reload started to work.

A:

I think the problem exist because you use $(form).submit(). What you probably want to do is to send data from the form to the server and refresh the data in the grid after the server processed the form submittion.
The $(form).submit() will be used in the case that your page consist mostly from the form. In the case you submit the data and the page will be refreshed. What you probably really want to do you can implement with respect of $.ajax with type: 'POST' parameter or with respect of its simplified form $.post. You can set the submit event handler (or click handler if you rename the type of the button) and inside the handler you can send the data to the server per $.ajax manually. In the case you can use success handler to reload the grid. Inside of submit event handler you can get the form data with $(form).serialize() and you should return false to prevent standard submitting of the form. See here an example. You should don't forget to define name attribute to all fields of the form which you want send to the server (see here).
I don't know exactly which relationship has the form to the grid data, but one more possible

    if (sponser.value == "NH") {
        document.getElementById('nameofperson').style.display = "none";
        document.getElementById('nameofpersonvalue').style.display = "none";
        document.getElementById('address').style.display = "none";
        document.getElementById('th1').style.display = "none";
        document.getElementById('th8').style.display = "table-row";
    }

    if (sponser.value == "Y") {
        document.getElementById('nameofperson').style.display = "none";
        document.getElementById('nameofpersonvalue').style.display = "none";
        document.getElementById('address').style.display = "none";
    }
}

The function is called from the HTML with an onclick event which looks like this:
<input type="radio" name="IPQ_FUND1" id="IPQ_FUND1" value="Y" checked="checked" onclick="addSponsership(this);"/>

I now want to call all of these functions using the onload event on the body element. However, I am unsure how to do this. Example:
function callAllOtherFunctions()
{
 addSponsership(sponser)
 addSponsership2(sponser)
 addSponsership3(sponser)
 etc...
}

The problem with this is that I can't find a way to refer to the specific elements whose values need to be checked. Ideally I need to find a solution to this without editing the original functions written by my colleague. 
I tried to do it individually by creating another function that looked like this:
function addSponsershipLoad(inputID){
  sponser = document.getElementById(inputID);
   addSponsership(sponser);
    }

and editing the body tag to look like this:
<body onload="addSponserShipLoad('IPQ_FUND1');">

but despite the console not showing any errors, this didn't work.
So, I know I'm probably being quite thick and the solution will be simple, but please help if you can. 

A:

You don't have to put everything in variables:
addSponsership(document.getElementById('IPQ_FUND1'));


I got events that happen at locations:

    date_start = models.DateTimeField('start date')
    date_end = models.DateTimeField('end date')
    def __unicode__(self):
        return self.title
    description = models.TextField()
    price = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)
    tags = TaggableManager()
    location = models.ForeignKey(Location, blank=False)

class Location(models.Model):
    location_title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    location_date_published = models.DateTimeField('published date',default=datetime.now, blank=True)
    location_latitude = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    location_longitude = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    location_address = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    location_city = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    location_zipcode = models.CharField(max_length=200)

    location_description = models.TextField()
    def __unicode__(self):

I can get the results of all via:

    class Meta:
        model = Event
        depth = 2
        fields = ('url','id','title','date_start','date_end','description', 'price', 'location')

There is some redundant code in the constructor, so there could still be a better way to write this mechanism. But you should get an idea of how you could clean up your ifs

I'm having a hard time figuring out how to put this all together.
I have a puzzle solving app on the mac.
You enter the puzzle, press a button, and while it's trying to find the number of solutions,
min moves and such I would like to keep the UI updated.
Then once it's finished calculating, re-enable the button and change the title.
Below is some sample code from the button selector, and the solving function:
( Please keep in mind I copy/paste from Xcode so there might be some missing {} or
some other typos.. but it should give you an idea what I'm trying to do.
Basicly, user presses a button, that button is ENABLED=NO, Function called to calculate puzzle.  While it's calculating, keep the UI Labels updated with moves/solution data.
Then once it's finished calculating the puzzle, Button is ENABLED=YES;
Called when button is pressed:
- (void) solvePuzzle:(id)sender{
    solveButton.enabled = NO;
    solveButton.title = @"Working . . . .";

    // I've tried using this as a Background thread, but I can't get the code to waitTilDone before continuing and changing the button state.
    [self performSelectorInBackground:@selector(createTreeFromNode:) withObject:rootNode];

    // I've tried to use GCD but similar issue and can't get UI updated.
    //dispatch_queue_t queue = dispatch_queue_create("com.gamesbychris.createTree", 0);
    //dispatch_sync(queue, ^{[self createTreeFromNode:rootNode];});

    }

    // Need to wait here until createTreeFromNode is finished.
    solveButton.enabled=YES;
    if (numSolutions == 0) {
    solveButton.title = @"Not Solvable";
    } else {
        solveButton.title = @"Solve Puzzle";
    }
}

Needs to run in background so UI can be updated:
-(void)createTreeFromNode:(TreeNode *)node
{
   // Tried using GCD
   dispatch_queue_t main_queue = dispatch_get_main_queue();

A:

With v[x, t] the dependent variable, and x the spatial independent variable ranging from x1 to x2, the requested boundary conditions are,
v[x1, t] == 0
(D[v[x, t], x] /. x -> x2) == 0

In answer to the OP's comment below, these and any other boundary and initial conditions are included in the first argument of NDSolveValue, as illustrated by several of the Basic Examples in the documentation.
Edit
As noted in my comment below, the question's recently added code can be made to work with the change,
r0 = .1;
BCr = NDSolveValue[{eqn == 0, Subscript[Γ, D], (D[T[t, r, z], z] /. z -> 0) == 0, 
    (D[T[t, r, z], r]

Q:

Prove that $\int\int_Df(x,y)dA \leq \int\int_D g(x,y)dA$ if $f(x,y) \leq g(x,y)$ for all $(x,y) \in D$

Suppose that $f,g$ are integrable function on a Jordan set $D$ such that $f(x,y) \leq g(x,y)$ for all $(x,y) \in D$. Prove that $\int\int_Df(x,y)dA \leq \int\int_D g(x,y)dA$
Here is what I got:
Assume that $f,g$ are integrable function on a Jordan set $D$ such that $f(x,y) \leq g(x,y)$ for all $(x,y) \in D$. 
Since $f(x,y) \leq g(x,y)$ for all $(x,y) \in D$, $g(x,y)-f(x,y) \geq 0$ for all $(x,y) \in D$
Since $f,g$ are integrable function on a Jordan set $D$ , they are bounded and
$$\int\int_D [g(x,y)-f(x,y)] \geq 0$$
$$\int\int_D [g(x,y)-f(x,y)]=\int\int_D [g(x,y)]- \int\int_D[f(x,y)] \geq 0$$
$$\int\int_D [g(x,y)] \geq \int\int_D[f(x,y)]$$
Please feel free to fix if I'm wrong

A:

Two problems pop out right away: first, the integral of a function $f$ is not given by the formula $$\int\int_Df(x,y)dA = \sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^m(M_{f_i}-m_{f_i})(\Delta x_i \Delta y_j). $$ Second $f(x,y) \le g(x,y)$ does not imply $M_{f_i}-m_{f_i} \le

Get current frame of video in javascript / jquery

I am playing video using the html video tag. While playing video I want the current frame of the video not "currentTime" using jquery or javascript. 
I am able to get the current frame by doing the calculation of the fps of video and currentTime, but it is not giving the exact frame number. Any ideas how I can fix this?

A:

Please check out below demo. Only one thing is you have to assign a frameRate of video. External Js will manage all thing and you can get Frame number easily.

var currentFrame = $('#currentFrame');
var video = VideoFrame({
    id : 'video',
    frameRate: 29.97,
    callback : function(frame) {
        currentFrame.html(frame);
    }
});

$('#play-pause').click(function(){
    ChangeButtonText();
});

function ChangeButtonText(){
  if(video.video.paused){
        video.video.play();
        video.listen('frame');
        $("#play-pause").html('Pause');
    }else{
        video.video.pause();
        video.stopListen();
        $("#play-pause").html('Play');
    }
  }

Please note: If you use older Ubuntu versions than 12.04, the command is empty-trash!

A:

If you're on GNOME, there's now a feature for that! Go to Privacy in your settings and look under Purge Trash & Temporary Files.

More at https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/privacy-purge.html.en.

A:

Try with Autotrash!
Autotrash is a simple Python script comes with Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat which will purge files from your trash when they become older than a given days,purge older files to ensure a specific amount of disk space is free,etc.It uses the FreeDesktop.org Trash Info files included in the new GNOME system to find the correct files and the dates they where deleted.
Features:

Remove files that are older then a given number of days
(autotrash -d N,where N is the number of days)
Purge older files to ensure a specific amount of disk space is free
(autotrash --min-free=M,M is the amount of free space you want to ensure you have, in megabytes.)
Check for remaining disk space, and only delete if you are running out
(autotrash --max-free=M,M is the amount of free space left, in megabytes.)
Delete regex matching files first (see –delete-frist option)

For more info,execute this in terminal:
autotrash --help
AutoTrash is already in Ubuntu 10.10′s repository,it can be installed from Ubuntu Software Center.For Ubuntu 10.04 and 9.10 user,install this from PPA:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install autotrash

How polite is おっけーです when it is said by the shop staff to a customer?

Let me describe the scenario first so you can get the nuance better.
I was looking for a new apartment from several agents. An agent "A" to which I will refer for the following explanation provided me with services such as searching for several apartments that conforms to my budget, bringing me to look at the apartments, etc. It was on Friday. As no apartments satisfied me, the staff will provide me with other options in the next Monday.
As I have no time to wait, I go to other agents and I found an apartment on Saturday. Sunday afternoon, there was a call from the agent A saying, when you will come tomorrow? My reply is as follows:

大変申し訳ありません。新しいアパートを見つけてしまいましたので・・・

And his respond is

オッケーです

Question
How polite is おっけーです when it is said by the shop staff to a customer?
Is there any feel of disappointment in this context?

A:

オッケーです on its own does not have a feel of disappointment. It's just "I understood" or "okay," which can be said with or without disappointment. (But writing it with hiragana (おっけーです) is only acceptable in a chat with your close friends. You heard it, right?)
オッケーです is relatively colloquial and casual. It's definitely inappropriate if this is said by a receptionist of a luxury hotel you visit for the first time. But some experts like real estate agents and physicians tend to drop keigo (at least very formal ones) fairly quickly once you are familiar with them. Saying オッケーです with a smile is not necessarily a bad word choice.
Another possibility is that he just tried to speak in easy Japanese. We all know keigo is difficult. Depending on how fluent you are, people may avoid using difficult keigo like 承知致しました even in a business setting.

A:

It is not overly formal, but it is not impolite.  I'd say it is on the friendly side.  So unless there was some hint in the way they said it to indicate that they were disappointed, I'd not think twice about it.

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
@autoreleasepool {
    return UIApplicationMain(argc, argv, nil, NSStringFromClass([ArrayTableAppDelegate class]));
}
}

What would you recommend? Should I turn off ARC and call my own releases? so that I can get to the second tableView?

A:

First mistake:
In viewDidLoad method, you have created the mainArray with secondArray and thirdArray as elements even before you allocated those arrays.
Second mistake:
In cellForRowAtIndexPath: method:
Check the line cell.textLabel.text = [mainArray objectAtIndex:[indexPath row]];
Actually the textLabel expects a NSString value to set. But you are setting an array.
Edit:

Решить задачу без простого перебора в массиве, сохраняя только состояние между запросами

Задан массив, состоящий из n целых чисел: a[1], a[2], ..., a[n], по умолчанию заполнены нулями. Более того, заданы m запросов, каждый из которых характеризуется тремя числами li, ri, ki. Запрос li, ri, ki обозначает, что нужно добавить к каждому элементу a[j], где li ≤ j ≤ ri, число Ckij - li + ki.
Запись Cxy обозначает биномиальный коэффициент, или количество сочетаний из y элементов по x элементов.
Вам нужно выполнить последовательно все запросы и вывести, чему будут равны элементы массива в итоге, после всех запросов.

  В первой строке заданы целые числа n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105).
Во второй строке задано n целых чисел a[1], a[2], ..., a[n] (0 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — изначальное состояние массива.
В следующих m строках заданы запросы в формате li, ri, ki — прибавить всем элементам отрезка li...ri число Ckij - li + ki (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n; 0 ≤ k ≤ 100).

To find the determinant you need to find the upper triangular matrix and then multiply the diagonal elements of the matrix.

  1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
  -1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\

Q:

How do you write to a span using jQuery?

I'm trying to populate a <span></span> element on the page load with jQuery.
At the moment the value that gets populated into the span is just an integer count.
Here I have named my span userCount:
<a href="#" class="">Users<span id = "userCount"></span></a>

I am trying to write the value of the span with no success.
$(document).ready(function () {
    $.post("Dashboard/UsersGet", {}, function (dataset) {
        var obj = jQuery.parseJSON(dataSet);
        var table = obj.Table;

        var countUsers;
        for (var i = 0, len = table.length; i < len; i++) {
            var array = table[i];
            if (array.Active == 1) {
                  var name = array.Name;
            }
            countUsers = i;
        }
        userCount.innerHTML = countUsers.toString();
    });
});

A:

You don't have any usercount variable. Use $(selector) to build a jquery object on which you can call functions like html.
 $('#userCount').html(countUsers);

Note also that

you don't need to convert your integer to a string manually.
if you don't break from the loop, countUsers will always be table.length-1.
you have a typo : dataSet instead of dataset. Javascript is case sensitive.
you don't need to parse the result of the request
you don't need to pass empty data : jQuery.post checks the type of the provided parameters

So, this is probably more what you need, supposing you do other things in the loop :
    $.post("Dashboard/UsersGet", function (dataset) {
        var table = dataset.Table;
        var countUsers = table.length; // -1 ?
        // for now, the following loop is useless
        for (var i=0, i<table.length; i++) { // really no need to optimize away the table.length
            var array = table[i];
            if (array.Active == 1) { // I hope array isn't an array...
                var name = array.Name; //

I've created a template part in PHP that copies a button to each slide in a carousel using fullpage.js. The template part has a hidden div that should open up navigation for each slide. Trying the code below, I can only get this button to work on the first slide. I'm thinking an iterated class name might help, but not sure why querySelectorAll wouldn't do it. Any advice appreciated...

Q:

How to view the list of c library functions in Linux?

I'm a newbie in Linux programming. I found that the way to view the list of system calls in Linux via command-line is: man syscalls
But now I want to view the list of c library functions, how can I do that? Which command will help me list the c library functions? And another question, where are system calls and c library functions manual pages located? Thank you.

A:

System calls man pages are located in the section 2 of the man pages, see intro(2), and their list in syscalls(2)
Library functions man pages are located in the section 3 of the man pages, see intro(3). There are many of them (and most of them use some syscalls, but some don't need any syscalls e.g. round(3)).
And some useful Glibc specific functions don't have man pages, for example argp functions.
As Elliot Frisch commented, see Gnu libc documentation.
BTW, you could use something else than GNU libc, for instance musl libc.
You should also read Advanced Linux Programming and some pthread tutorial.
Read also the Posix opengroup documentation.
At last, Linux also have many very widely used libraries, like ncurses and gnu readline for terminal I/O, and GTK or Qt for graphical user interfaces above X11 (both having a foundational library : Gobject+Glib for GTK, and QtCore for Qt, which is useful by itself outside of any GUI programs). 
And freecode, sourceforge, github and many other places mention many free software libraries, most of them being developed on Linux. For instance libonion is a useful library giving you HTTP server abilities.
For databases, see mariadb, mongodb, postgresql, gdbm, sqlite etc... (and jansson for JSON textual serialization)
BTW, your Linux distribution should give you a lot of development packages too. On Debian more than 200 packages match lib*dev package name (and some libraries have a development package named differently).
There are several good books about Linux programming, see this...
Be aware that Linux is mostly free-software friendly. Give attention to software licenses and their compatibility.
If possible, make your own Linux software project a free software, e.g. by publishing it with

A finite abelian group $G$ has an element $g$ of order $n$, which generates the subgroup $H = \langle g \rangle$.  Let $\gamma$ be an element of order $m$ in $G/H$.  Show that there exists an element $x \in G$ such that $\lvert x \rvert = \lvert \gamma \rvert = m$.

I copied my instructor's solution, but I missed the last part, and I can't proceed from what's on my notebook.

Suppose that $x_0 \in G$ such that $\overline{x_0} = \gamma$.  Since $\lvert \gamma \rvert = m$, $x_0^m \in H = \langle g \rangle$, and we denote $x_0^m = g^k$.  Divide $k$ by $m$ to get $k = mq + r$ with $r \in \{0,\dots,m-1\}$.
  \begin{align}
x_0^m &= g^k = g^{mq + r} \\
g^r &= x_0^m g^{-mq} = \left(x_0 g^{-q} \right)^m
\end{align}
  We want to show $r=0$.
  Let $x' = x_0 g^{-q}$.  Observe that $\overline{\mathstrut x'}=\overline{\mathstrut x_0}=\gamma$ and $m \mid \lvert x' \rvert$ because $$e = x'^{\mathstrut \lvert x' \rvert} = x_0^{\mathstrut \lvert x' \rvert} \underbrace{g^{\mathstrut -q \lvert x' \rvert}}_{\in H}.$$
  $$\therefore \lvert (x')^m \rvert = \frac{\lvert x' \rvert}{\gcd(m,\lvert x' \rvert)} = \frac{\lvert x' \rvert}{m}$$

I don't know how to continue with this.

A:

This argument seems overly complicated (and the conditions overly strict).
Claim. Let $G$ be a finite group and $H\lhd G$ a normal subgroup. Let $\gamma\in H$ be an element of order $m$. Then $G$ has an element $x$ of order $m$.

I want to create wavy underlines using TextDecoration (in a control similar to RichTextBox).
I did the following thing:
private static Pen CreateErrorPen() {
    var geometry = new StreamGeometry();
    using (var context = geometry.Open()) {
        context.BeginFigure(new Point(0.0, 0.0), false, false);
        context.PolyLineTo(new[] {
            new Point(0.75, 0.75),
            new Point(1.5, 0.0),
            new Point(2.25, 0.75),
            new Point(3.0, 0.0)
        }, true, true);
    }

    var brushPattern = new GeometryDrawing {
        Pen = new Pen(Brushes.Red, 0.2),
        Geometry = geometry
    };

    var brush = new DrawingBrush(brushPattern) {
        TileMode = TileMode.Tile,
        Viewport = new Rect(0.0, 1.5, 9.0, 3.0),
        ViewportUnits = BrushMappingMode.Absolute
    };

    var pen = new Pen(brush, 3.0);
    pen.Freeze();

    return pen;
}

This almost works, but depending on the underlined word position in text, underlines often show up as a pattern of several superimposed waves. Also the underlines are a bit blurry even when they are correct (wpf problem with drawing between pixels, I suppose).
My solution was kind of a trial-and-error, so I might have gone a wrong way, especially with Viewport/ViewportUnits.
What am I doing wrong and is there a way to get crisp underlines?
Thanks in advance.

A:

bstoney had a solution to this problem here.  The key seems to be setting the Viewbox as well as the Viewport such that the waves are seperated vertically, so you only get 1 in the underline.
There are some breaks in the wave that can be eliminated by extending it to the right and changing the Viewbox from so it starts from X=1 instead of 0:
<VisualBrush x:Key="WavyBrush" TileMode="Tile" Viewbox="1,0,3,3" ViewboxUnits="Absolute

Q:

Bootstrap dropdown submenu closing upstream submenu

I have a two-level dropdown that's working great, but when I add another level, the JS seems to be removing the open class from the previous submenu, which means that the desired third-level menu can't be seen, even though it does get the open class added.
I've tracked it down to this JS:
  $(function() {

  $('li.dropdown-submenu').on('click', function(event) {
      event.stopPropagation();
      if ($(this).hasClass('open')){
          $(this).removeClass('open');
      } else {
          $('li.dropdown-submenu').removeClass('open');
          $(this).addClass('open');
     }
  });
});

This is, I think, doing the undesired closing of the previous submenu. The HTML is very similar to this example.
Using an adaptation of the JS from that example, I get the third level, but then any given open submenu doesn't automatically close when clicking another submenu. 
$(document).ready(function(){
  $('.dropdown-submenu a').on("click", function(e){
    $(this).next('ul').toggle();
    e.stopPropagation();
    e.preventDefault();
  });
});

Need the best of both here!

A:

I think you almost had it, you just needed to look for the different clicks.
The approach I took below was to handle all a clicks but then check to see if it had a class of test which then followed your code verbatim or else, if it didn't have a class of test it then hides all the submenus and goes to it's default href.
<script>
$(document).ready(function(){
  $('.dropdown-submenu a').on("click", function(e){
    if ($(this).hasClass('test')) {
      $(this).next('ul').toggle();
      e.stopPropagation();
      e.preventDefault();
    } else {
      $('.dropdown-submenu ul').hide();
    }
  });
});
</script>

Overridden doDML() in EntityImpl does not refresh attributes

I am using an Oracle ADF page to update data in a table.  My entity object is based on the table, but I want the DML (inserts, updates, deletes) to go through a package procedure in the database instead of using the default DML generated by the ADF framework.
To accomplish this, I am following Oracle's documentation, found here: http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23943_01/web.1111/b31974/bcadveo.htm#ADFFD1129
This all works fine.  The problem is, the default ADF DML processing will automatically refresh the entity row after writing it, either with a RETURNING INTO clause or with a separately issued SELECT statements (depending on the value of isUseReturningClause() in the EntityDefImpl object).  This is done so that the application front end gets updated in case the row was modified by the database during the DML process (e.g., a BEFORE ROW trigger changes values).
But, when I overwrite doDml() to replace the default framework DML with a call to my package procedure, it no longer automatically refreshes, even if isUseReturningClause() returns false.
I tried adding code to my doDml() implementation to requery afterwards, but it didn't work (maybe I didn't do it correctly).  But, Oracle's documentation doesn't say anything about having to do that.
Does anyone know how to accomplish this?

Update
I went back to my attempt to have doDml() refresh afterwards by calling doSelect() and it works.  My original attempt didn't work because doSelect() wasn't sending notifications of its changes.
Still, I'm concerned that this isn't how Oracle's documentation says to do it so I have no idea if this is correct or a kludge or a plain bad idea.  So, my original question still stands.

I logged an SR with Oracle.  Their response was that if you override doDML() and do not call super.doDML() then you lose the automatic refresh functionality of the framework.
They wouldn't comment on my solution, which was to call doSelect(false) after any inserts or updates in my doDML() override.  Their policy is that if you want advice

how to delete a backbone model

I have created the following code and i'm unable to destroy a model from the backend.
I get a 'model is not defined error'.
I don't know why it cannot find a model? what parameters am i missing? am i wrong in adding this in this list view? should i add it in the models view? and if that is the case i added the save new model in the list view so can't see why i can't add it her.

It is my first time to use Java Thread Pool for my new project, after I came across this
link http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2013/01/java-thread-pool-example-using-executors-and-threadpoolexecutor.html, I am more confused on this, here is the code from the page,
package com.journaldev.threadpool;

public class WorkerThread implements Runnable {

    private String command;

    public WorkerThread(String s){
        this.command=s;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()+' Start. Command = '+command);
        processCommand();
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()+' End.');
    }

    private void processCommand() {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(5000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public String toString(){
        return this.command;
    }
}

package com.journaldev.threadpool;

import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class SimpleThreadPool {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            Runnable worker = new WorkerThread('' + i);
            executor.execute(worker);
          }
        executor.shutdown();
        while (!executor.isTerminated()) {
        }
        System.out.println('Finished all threads');
    }

}

in the code, a fixed size pool is created and 10 worker threads are created, am I right?
The thread pool is supposed to decrease the burden of a system, on the contrary, in the above code, I think it increases the burden by creating the pool in addition to the worker threads. why bother to use the thread pool?
Can anyone explain?
Thanks

How to add random number id inside div class

bellow is my html code. this content-box will depend on content. i could be 5, 10, 20 what ever. because it will be dynamic content. now i want to add one more class each div randomly and class name will be color-1, color-2, color-3, color-4, color-5,..............  color-10. so number range will be 1-10. so how could i add those class in content-box random numberly. any idea please.  
HTML:
<div class="content-box">
    <img src="images/love-01.jpg" />
</div>
<div class="content-box">
    <img src="images/love-05.jpg" />
</div>
<div class="content-box">
    <img src="images/love-02.jpg" />
</div>
<div class="content-box">
    <img src="images/love-03.jpg" />
</div>
<div class="content-box">
    <img src="images/love-04.jpg" />
</div>

http://jsfiddle.net/dKgaz/

A:

$('div.content-box').addClass(function(){
    var color = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;
    return 'color-' + (color < 10 ? '0' + color : color)
});

JS Fiddle demo.
Updated the demo, to be a little more obvious: demo.

A:

I've updated your JSFiddle. Basically you want the following javascript:
$('.content-box').each(function() {
    var number = 1 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 10);
    $(this).addClass("color-" + number.toString());
});

Your JSFiddle demo updated
The $('.content-box').each bit selects each element with the content-box class and then loops through the collection applying whatever is in the brackets. In this case Math.random() gives you a number between 0 and 1, which we multiply by 10 and add 1 to get a random number between 1 and 10. The Math.floor bit ensures that there are no decimal places.
Finally we take that number

Q:

Invoke particular writer based on operation type?

I am working one batch which reads each row and insert into db as well as write in file. I want to write this below data in database as well as in file. So needs to call particular writer using ClassifierCompositeItemWriter. I have file which has following rows:
DATA,I,1,John,Shiazo,Sushi
DATA,U,8,Pablo,Carmen
DATA,D,9,Diego,Sergio
DATA,I,10,rucha,rekha
Here, I stands for insert, U stands for update and D stands for delete. How should I call one particular writer for insert, other is for update and one more is for delete. This three writer will work differently based on operations(Insert, Update and Delete) and there is one more writer which will always for work for writing data in file.
Below is my sample code:
@Classifier
public List<String> classify(Object object) {
    String type = "Success";
    List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
    if(person.getOperationType().contentEquals("I")){
        String insert = "I";
        list.add(type);
        list.add(insert);   
    }else if(person.getOperationType().contentEquals("U")){
        String update = "U";
        list.add(type);
        list.add(insert);
    }else{
        delete = "D";
        list.add(type);
        list.add(delete);
    }
}

Sample xml writer code:
<bean id="classifierFileItemWriter" class="org.springframework.batch.item.support.ClassifierCompositeItemWriter" scope="step">       <property name="classifier">           <bean class="org.springframework.classify.BackToBackPatternClassifier">             <property name="routerDelegate">
                <bean class="com.iz.batchprocessing.writer.SuccessFailClassifier" scope="step"/>
            </property>
            <property name="matcherMap">
                <map>
                     <entry key="I" value-ref="jdbcInsertItemWriter" /> //insert writer, here I want access ArrayList

Q:

Output multi-dimensional array with brackets

So I have this and I need to be able to output all of the arrays including brackets within the array.  The following example works by calling the index explicitly, but I can't seem to pass a function or a for loop where it is expecting an expression.  Also, a string will not do.
    for (var a in obj) {
    var dateArray = [];
    var date = new Date(obj[a]);
    // var date = new Date('March 29, 2016 14:00:00');
    var hours = date.getHours();
    var minutes = date.getMinutes();
    console.log(date.toString());
    console.log(hours);
    console.log(minutes);
    dateArray[0] = hours;
    dateArray[1] = minutes;
    disabled_time_list.push(dateArray);
}
for (var i = 0; i < disabled_time_list.length; i++) {
    console.log(disabled_time_list[i]);
}
pickertime.set('disable', [
    disabled_time_list[0]
    // [14,0],
]);

A:

In case anyone ever needs it, this is how I solved the problem:
$('.datepicker').change(function() {
    var datepicker = $('.datepicker').pickadate();
    var pickerdate = datepicker.pickadate('picker');
    var dateInput = pickerdate.get('value');

    var request = $.ajax({
        type: "POST",
        url: 'http://apptsch.dev/index.php/appointment/get_post_date',
        data: { date: dateInput }
    }).done(function(){
        disabled_time_list = [];
        var timepicker = $('.timepicker').pickatime();
        var pickertime = timepicker.pickatime('picker');
        var times_disabled = pickertime.get('disable');
        console.log(times_disabled);
        $.each(times_disabled,function( index, value) {
            pickertime.set('enable', [
                    times_disabled[index]
                ])
        }); // end

Getting the surface from Draggable

Please guys, help me out. I have this code: 
var image = new ImageSurface({
    size: [300, 300],
    properties: {
        border: '4px solid white'
    }
});

image.setContent('/img/' + _.random(1,7) + '.jpg');

var draggable = new Draggable({scale: 1});
image.pipe(draggable);

draggable.on('end', function(e) {
    // SURFACE????
});

var stateModifier = new StateModifier();

node.add(stateModifier).add(draggable).add(image);

stateModifier.setTransform(
    Transform.translate(100, 10, 0),
    { duration : 1000, curve: Easing.outElastic }
);

How can I get the Surface object from the draggable event? The parameter from the event is just the position.

A:

First, I am wondering why you need to get the surface from the event. If you have one draggable per surface, then you could do something with simple data binding.
eg.. 
var draggable = new Draggable({scale: 1});

draggable.image = image;

draggable.on('end', function(e) {
    var image = this.image;
});

If you really need to get the surface from the event you will have to edit the code that emits the event.
Just for the case of the end event..
Starting at line 129 of Draggable.js
function _handleEnd() {
    if (!this._active) return;
    this.eventOutput.emit('end', {position : this.getPosition()});
}

Could be changed to..
function _handleEnd() {
    if (!this._active) return;
    this.eventOutput.emit('end', {position : this.getPosition(), originalEvent:event });
}

Now you can do.. 
var draggable = new Draggable({scale: 1});

draggable.on('end', function(e) {
    var image = e.originalEvent.origin;
});

I'm thinking I must have some syntax errors messing up the works but I'm new enough to this to not see it. When I use the alert to call out the objData variable it says 'undefined' in Safari. It acts like it

SQL - how to select all rows between two tables with relations,

First of all, I'm sorry with my bad english. 
I wanted to select all row in this two table (Company and Contacts), but when there's a related data between two tables then display as 1 rows.
Table Company:
+---------+-----------+----------+
| cmpy_id | Company   | Cntct_id |
+---------+-----------+----------+
| 1       | Company 1 |   1      |
| 2       | Company 2 |          | 
| 3       | Company 3 |          |
+---------+-----------+----------+

Table Contacts:
+----------+-----------+
| Cntct_id | Contact   |
+----------+-----------+
| 1        | Contact 1 |
| 2        | Contact 2 |
| 3        | Contact 3 |
+----------+-----------+

Result I need:
+-----------+------------+
| Contact   |  Company   |
+-----------+------------+
| Contact 1 |  Company 1 |
| Contact 2 |            | 
| Contact 3 |            |
|           |  Company 2 |
|           |  Company 3 |
+-----------+------------+

How can i achieve that result?

A:

SELECT Contact,Company 
FROM Contacts contact
LEFT JOIN Company company ON company.Cntct_id=contact.Cntct_id 
UNION 
SELECT Contact,Company 
FROM Contacts contact
RIGHT JOIN Company company ON company.Cntct_id=contact.Cntct_id;

Explanation:
First LEFT JOIN would get us all the records from the left table(Table:Contacts) regardless of whether or not they have a match in the right table(Table : Company), like this:
SELECT Contact,Company  
FROM Contacts contact 
LEFT JOIN Company company ON company.Cntct_id=contact.Cntct_id;

Contact     Company
==============================
Contact 1   Company 1
Contact 2   NULL
Contact 3   NULL

Then the second RIGHT JOIN would get us all the records from the right table(Table : Company) regardless of whether or not they have a match in the left table(Table:Contacts), like this:
SELECT Contact,Company  
FROM Contacts

Why are there no stars visible in cislunar space?

It’s very puzzling that the moon landing had no stars in the background, the ISS clips have no stars in the background. I listened to multiple astronaut interviews speak on what it looks like up in space and about half of them speak of the “darkest black space”. I’m sure there is a very good explanation for this. 
Is star light only visible through the medium of earth atmosphere? But once in the vacuum of space where there is no medium they disappear? What’s the explanation?

A:

It is a matter of exposure and dynamic range. A sensor like a camera can only handle inputs in a certain range of intensities, and much of photographic skill (or smart presets) is about mapping the outside light onto this range so the details you care about show up rather than turn into white or black.
If you take a picture of a brightly lit scene, in order to make out the details of the bright parts (such as a lunar landscape, the Earth, the ISS etc) you will have to adjust the exposure making faint objects like the stars too dim to see against a dark sky background. You could try to set the exposure to show the stars instead, but now the landscape and Earth would be too bright (and likely also mess up the picture by causing flaring). 
One can try to work around it by taking several pictures at different exposure levels and later digitally compositing them together. But this requires a lot of extra work.

Anders's answer is entirely fine, but I'd like to add some extra information. As evidenced by the transcripts, reflected Earth light is quite strong even at this distance:

The earthshine coming through the window is so bright you can read a book by it.

That is, even with the lights turned off, it would probably be tricky to see the stars unless you turned in a way that didn't allow the earthshine through the windows.
However, as the capsule comes into the shadow cast by the Moon (a pure accident - they didn't plan for the approach to go this way), there comes:

Houston, it's been a real change for us. Now we are able to see stars again and recognize constellations for the first time on the trip. It's -

We are using Jetspeed in a project and have a requirement that jetspeed should authenticate against a third party rest service which accepts username and password and returns back the User Object.
The most simplest and straightforward way I found of implementing this without effecting jetspeed too much was to write a custom AuthenticationProvider extending the DefaultAuthenticationProvider class and overriding the login method.
After I authenticate the user I get back the User details including roles, email, etc. Now if the user already exists in jetspeed database, I sync his roles, else I create the user and assign him the roles returned by the remote service.
Now I want a way to set the user.email, user.firstname and user.lastname properties too, so that it is accessible using $jetspeed.getUserAttribute in the psml files. Any idea how can we do this?
Here is my code [cut out unnecessary stuff] --
public class CustomAuthenticationProvider extends BaseAuthenticationProvider {

....

    public AuthenticatedUser authenticate(String userName, String password) throws SecurityException {

        try {

            //Login the user
            UserSessionDTO customSession = Security.login(userName, password);

            //Fetch the user details
            UserDTO customUser = customSession.getUser();

            //Get the user roles
            List<UserRoleDTO> roles = customUser.getUserRoleDTOList();

            //Verify/create the user in jetspeed user database
            UserImpl user = null;
            if (!um.userExists(customUser.getLoginId())) {
                user = (UserImpl) um.addUser(customUser.getLoginId(), true);

                //Standard data
                user.setMapped(true);
                user.setEnabled(true);
            } else {
                user = (UserImpl) um.getUser(customUser.getLoginId());
            }

            //Sync the portal user roles with the CMGI user roles
            List<Role> portalRoles = rm.getRolesForUser(customUser.getLoginId());
            for (Role portalRole : portalRoles) {
                Boolean found = Boolean.FALSE;
                for (UserRoleDTO role : roles) {
                    if (role.getRoleName().equalsIgnoreCase(portal

Get path of the file to execute from received http request

I am writing a backend app to receive .jar file from the client and run it. Following is the client code. 
    let formData = new FormData();
    let req = new XMLHttpRequest();
    let file = document.getElementById("filePath").files[0];
    formData.append("jarFile", file);
    req.open("POST", '/deployArtifact');
    req.send(formData);

I need to write the backend endpoint(Node Red) to get this file and run it. Following is the sketch of the nodejs post endpoint code. 
    RED.httpAdmin.post("/deployArtifact", RED.auth.needsPermission('MyNode.read'), function (req, res) {
    console.log(req.files);
    console.log(req);
    cmd.get(
            'java -jar ' + xxxx,
            function (err, data, stderr) {
                if (err) {
                    res.json(err);
                } else {
                    res.json(data);
                }
            });
});

First, I need to get the file object receiving. I tried to access req.files but got undefined for it. I printed whole req. Following is the Incoming message. 
IncomingMessage {
  _readableState: 
   ReadableState {
     objectMode: false,

Table Schema:
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Message](

    [created_on] [datetime] NULL,
    [message] [nvarchar](max) NULL,
 CONSTRAINT [PK_Message] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED 
(
    [id] ASC
)
) ON [PRIMARY]

Values:
1   '2013-01-01 00:00:00.000'   'error occured "BASKET_BALL"'
2   '2014-01-01 00:00:00.000'   'error occured "FOOT_BALL"'
3   '2012-01-01 00:00:00.000'   'I am not involved in like operator'
4   '2014-02-01 00:00:00.000'   'I might be involved'

Query return against the table:
SELECT 
    ID,CREATED_ON,MESSAGE 
FROM 
    MESSAGE
WHERE 
    MESSAGE NOT LIKE '%"FOOT_BALL"%' OR MESSAGE NOT LIKE '%BASKET_BALL%'
    AND CREATED_ON >= '2014-01-01'

Output:
1   2013-01-01 00:00:00.000 error occured "BASKET_BALL"
2   2014-01-01 00:00:00.000 error occured "FOOT_BALL"
3   2012-01-01 00:00:00.000 I am not involved in like operator
4   2014-02-01 00:00:00.000 I might be involved

Question:
Could some one explain why the query returns all the table values when explicitly the date condition is mentioned for greater than 2014 ? I understand by keeping the message condition in bracket it yields proper result. However, like to know why the sql excludes date condition mentioned when the not like operator is not in bracket.

A:

It's because the AND operator has higher precedence than OR. Change to this:
SELECT 
    ID,CREATED_ON,MESSAGE 
FROM 
    MESSAGE
WHERE 
    (MESSAGE NOT LIKE '%"FOOT_BALL"%' OR MESSAGE NOT LIKE '%BASKET_BALL%')
    AND CREATED_ON >=

What does the code $('body').on('hidden.bs.modal', '.modal', function (){....} do and when does it gets called?

I've following HTML to show the bootstrap modal dialog:
<div class="panel-body" data-toggle="modal" href="ajax_event_detail.php?event_id=512" data-target="#myModal-event" style="cursor: pointer;"></div>

I thought that maybe I needed the contents of the file, instead of the location so I tried the following but got the same error:
profile.CertificateFile = new StreamReader(@"MyTestCertificate.txt").ReadToEnd().ToString();

It seems that whatever you set the CertificateFile property to, you get a fatal exception.
A couple of questions:

Where can I find documentation on the IAPIProfile class in the Paypal API, in particular documentation for the CertificateFile property
If I am not supposed to put the path to my certificate file in this location, what am I supposed to do?

Just to confirm, MyTestCertificate.txt is added to my solution and Copy to Output Directory is set to Copy Always.
The exception text is as follows:

{"Exception of type 'com.paypal.sdk.exceptions.FatalException' was thrown."}

The StackTrace looks like this:

at MyProject_Payment_Processing.Paypal.DoCaptureCode(String authorization_id, String amount) in C:\Users\JMK\documents\visual studio 2010\Projects\MyProject Payment Processing\MyProject Payment Processing\Paypal.cs:line 16

The Paypal API uses Log4Net which logs the error as so:

angular guard-service inject service

I need to inject a service in a guard. This guard checks if the user was invited, when yes, he can access the route.
To check this condition, I need to call a service which fetches this information from the db.
I have a cyclical dependency error, I understand that we shouldn't inject services in Guards, but in this case, I need to do it:
  providers: [AuthService, HackService, HacksStorageService, AuthGuard, EmailGuard],

And the guard:
import { ActivatedRouteSnapshot, RouterStateSnapshot, CanActivate } from "../../../node_modules/@angular/router";
import { HacksStorageService } from "../shared/hacks-storage.service";

export class EmailGuard implements CanActivate {

  constructor(
    private hacksStorageService: HacksStorageService,
  ) {}

  canActivate(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot) {
    this.hacksStorageService.fetchHack();
    // check if user was invited. should be in the participants array
    return true;
  }
}

I am pretty confused. Usually I used guards to see if user is logged in or not, so I usually imported stuff from firebase, not from my own services, so not cyclical dependencies.
Now I want to check if a condition happens, based on my own data. How can I inject my own data in the EmailGuard, if I am not allowed to inject services because of the cyclical dependency?
Thanks.

A:

You can inject services in guards.
If your service returns synchronously, then you can just return immediately, like in your sample code.
Otherwise, I did it like this (using firebase auth)
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { CanActivate, ActivatedRouteSnapshot, RouterStateSnapshot, Router } from '@angular/router';
import { Observable, of } from 'rxjs';
import { map, first } from 'rxjs/operators';
import { AngularFireAuth } from '@angular/fire/auth';
import { Paths } from './paths';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class SignInGuard implements CanActivate {

I'm answering my own question as I found what the issue was. It wasn't even an OpenSSL problem. 
First, see this GitHub issue: SSL_write() returns SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL when size is 0
My code looks like this,
SSL_write(ssl, foo(), var);

foo creates a payload and returns a const char * and var is the length of that data. The thing is, they are actually member function and member variable of a C++ class and var is set by foo. According to C++ standard, evaluation order of function arguments are not specified. From 5.2.2,

The order of evaluation of arguments is unspecified. All side effects
  of argument expression evaluations take effect before the function is
  entered.

So, it is possible for the third parameter(var) to be evaluated before the second parameter(foo()). Indeed, it is what was happening according to the assembly output of the program. Below is an example.
class myclass {
  public:
    int l;
    const char *foo(){
      l = 10;
      return "mystring";
    }
};

int main()
{
  SSL *ssl;
  myclass instance;
  SSL_write(ssl, instance.foo(), instance.l);
}

and the assembly,

Maybe you can try usign AspectRatio Widget with an aspectRatio of 1.0 to keep the width and height the same (as a circle) and align the stack in the center
Scaffold(
  body: Center(
    child: Padding(
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(8),
        child: AspectRatio(
          aspectRatio: 1.0, //Give it an aspectRatio of 1
          child: MyWidget()
        ),
      )
  ),
),

class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Stack(
      alignment: Alignment.center, //align the Widgets to the Center of the Stack
      children: [
        //this is for the WHEEL
        Container(
          decoration: BoxDecoration(
            color: Colors.orange[800],
            shape: BoxShape.circle,
          ),
        ),
        //This is the GOLDEN BORDER
        Container(
          decoration: BoxDecoration(
            border: Border.all(width: 20, color: Colors.yellow),
            color: Colors.transparent,
            shape: BoxShape.circle,
          ),
        ),
        //This is the GOLDEN CENTER
        Container(
          width: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width / 12,
          decoration: BoxDecoration(
            color: Colors.yellow[200],
            shape: BoxShape.circle,
          ),
        ),
      ]
    );
  }
}

I don't have the assets so I make some Containers with

architecture foo of readfile_tb is
    signal rst:     std_logic := '1';
    signal clk:     std_logic := '0';
    signal eor:     std_logic;
    signal y:       std_logic;
begin

DUT:
    entity work.readfile
        port map (
            rst => rst,
            clk => clk,
            eor => eor,
            y => y
        );
CLOCK:
    process
    begin
        wait for 5 ns;
        clk <= not clk;
        if now > 830 ns then
            wait;
        end if;
    end process;
STIMULUS:
    process 
    begin
        wait for 10 ns;
        rst <= '0';
        wait; 
    end process;
end architecture;

I created input.txt from the 1 and 0 values in your question, one per line.
The first thing my simulator told me was there was a null access (pointer), which would have been the line (line_num). It occurred on the rising edge clock edge after rst is released in the READLINE procedure call.
On closer look, at the end of process you're obliviously doing a FILE_CLOSE, and the next READLINE will fail.
The solution to that is to perform a FILE_OPEN and FILE_CLOSE only once. This also raises the point that we're hanging our hat on rst to hold off readlines, and we could add an enable as an embellishment.
So, modifying the process:
        process (rst, clk) 
            file file_pointer:         text;
            variable line_content:  character;
            variable line_num:      line;
            -- variable j:             integer := 0;
            variable char:          character := '0'; 
            variable cnt:           integer range 0 to 80 := 0; -- defaults to 0
        begin
            if rst = '1' then
                eor <= '0';

Q:

Explanations for the complexity values for second preimage attack on GOST?

I've been reading the article "A (second) preimage attack on the GOST hash function" by F. Mendel et al (link) and I'm having some difficulty to grasp some of the values of complexities/probabilities in the attack. Specifically:

On page 228, how is the probability that two pairs lead to the corresponding values $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$ amount to $2^{-192}$?
On page 230, how is $2^{128}$ used in the calculation of the complexity of the compression function?
On page 230, why construct $2^{32}$ pseudo-preimages for the last iteration of GOST?
On page 231, how was the value for the probability of finding the right $M_{257}$ in the list $L$ obtained?
Finally, on another issue, what operation is referred to by the squared $\ominus$ symbol on page 231: $\Sigma^m = \Sigma^t \ominus M_{257}$. [My guess: subtraction modulo $2^{256}$ -- am I right?]

Thanks very much.

A:

Preliminary: Almost the same article is available for free without breaking any law, nor downloading 5GB (formatting is shifted by at most one third of a page). It is also (as well as all other articles of IACR crypto conferences from 2000-2011) in the IACR Online Proceedings, specifically in the FSE 2008 section, but then you need to subtract about 223 from the page numbers quoted in the question to get the page number in the PDF. For this reason it is best to use section (rather than page) numbers to designate a section of an article.

I have now answered all the points (and learned along the way), but anyone remains welcome to improve that answer, made community wiki.
1) In section 3, why does the probability that two pairs lead to the corresponding values $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$ amount to $2^{−192}$?
By construction, $x_i$, $y_i$, $z_i$, $s_i$ are 64-bit. We assume that the process that uncovered each pair, being independent of the relations $x_i=y_i\oplus z_i\

Q:

Trying to overlay videos with different start times

I'm trying to overlay two videos with different start times, and mix together their audio tracks. 
These input files are WebRTC recordings, and each contains a single audio or video track. 
Inputs: 

RTc0.webm: audio, Opus 40k, start time 9.078 sec
RT5f.webm: audio, Opus 40k, start time 1.262 sec
RT8c.mkv: video, H.264, start time 9.078 sec
RTf7.mkv: video, H.264, start time 1.298 sec

I want to draw these videos side-by-side and mix together their audio.  
First try, using -copyts
My initial thought was to use -copyts and just allow everything to align using their shared common timecode. 
My command line looks like: 
ffmpeg \
    -copyts \
    -ss 224.1 -i RTc0.webm -t 60 \
    -ss 224.1 -i RT5f.webm -t 60 \
    -ss 224.1 -i RTf7.mkv -t 60 \
    -ss 224.1 -i RT8c.mkv -t 60 \
    -filter_complex "

        color=c=black:s=1280x480 [background]; 
        [2:v] scale=640x480 [left]; 
        [3:v] scale=640x480 [right]; 
        [background][left]       overlay       [background+left]; 
        [background+left][right] overlay=x=640 [vout]; 

        [1:a][0:a] amix [aout]

    "  -c:v libx264 -preset veryfast -crf 28 -c:a aac -map "[vout]" -map "[aout]" -y \
    -f matroska combined.mkv

Running this, I get an output where the video is correct (one video starts at 0 sec, one starts 7 seconds later), but both audio tracks start at 0 sec. The expected behavior is one audio track starts at 0 secs and the other starts 7 seconds later synchronized with the second video track. 
Second try

Q:

Mass-Energy Equivalence theory energy or momentum is not conserved?

The famous equation for mass energy equivalence:  $E=mc^2$
It cannot conserve energy or momentum without some loss in one way or another. To elaborate further if I take $1kg$ of mass and I also take electromagnetic radiation with same energy as the $1kg$ mass and ensuring its accuracy using the above equation. Then use this radiation and I use it to smash it into a "crash" mat I would get this:
$$E=mc^2$$
$$E=1.c^2$$
$$E=89,401,000,000,000,000$$
Approx.
That being the energy we then use this to calculate the momentum of the electromagnetic radiation transferred onto the "crash" mat which would be:
$$p=mv$$
$$p=mc$$
$$p=e/c^2 . c $$
$$p=e/c$$
$$p=89,401,000,000,000,000/c$$
$$p=299,000,000$$
Approx.
where as if I now take $1kg$ of matter and accelerate it to high velocity (say, 10,000 kilometers per hour ) to measure its momentum we get roughly $10,000 kg.m/sec$
That being said, momentum cannot be conserved, why is that? Next, Energy cannot be conserved. 
For example if I used the same $1kg$ and I shoot it into space at a $x$ velocity and after say 1000 years I recieve it and measure mass of the object it would weigh exactly the same as 1000 years before therefore I can conclude it has same energy in its mass however if I use the mass-equivalent of electromagnetic radiation and do the same but my conclusion would be vastly different as first due to travelling in long fabric of space it would get slightly or even highly redshifted due to doppler effect. That being said the observer would get different energy reading to that of 1000 years ago. That in mind where did that energy go? 

A:

If you have a massive object of mass $m$ which spontaneously decays into electromagnetic radiation, then indeed the total energy of that electromagnetic radiation is $E=mc^2$. However the total momentum of that radiation would be $0$ due to momentum conservation.
From this, we can conclude that it is

Range of balls needed in lottery for 0 and 1 match to be equally likely with 5 balls drawn

The question is if there is a lottery in which 5 balls are drawn randomly without replacement, what is the number range of the balls needed so that matching exactly 0 of those balls or matching exactly 1 of them is equally likely (or as close to equally likely as possible)? Assume all balls are numbered sequentially from 1 to n (such as 1,2,3...n).  Solve for n.
I know this can be solved by trial and error but is there a mathematical way to get the answer without first guessing and then making corrections/adjustments?
I was also able to solve it using wolframalpha but how can someone solve it mathematically, either getting an exact same probability for matching exactly 0 or 1 ball(s) or such that the probability of matching exactly 0 or 1 is the closest it can be?
The idea is a hypothetical lottery wants to make it easier to match at least 1 ball so maybe more people play or people that play continue to do so.  So the lottery designer is interested to first find out where 0 and 1 matches are about equal, then adjust it slightly to favor at least 1 match.

A:

Here's what I think you're asking, generalized slightly. There are $n$ balls numbered $1, \ldots, n$. Lottery players choose $k$ distinct numbers with $k < n$, then $k$ balls are drawn. Tickets are rewarded according to the number of matches.
Each ticket should have the same probability distribution, so wlog assume that the player chooses $1, \ldots, k$. Then:

The number of zero-match drawings is $\binom{n-k}{k}$, the number of $k$-element subsets of $\{k+1, \ldots, n\}$. Note that at least one match is guaranteed unless $2k \leq n$.
The number of one-match drawings is $k \binom{n-k}{k-1}$, the number of one-element subsets of $\{1, \ldots, k\}$ times the number of $k-1$-element subsets of $\{k+1, \ldots, n\}$.

Solving for $n$:
\begin{align*}
\binom{n-k}{k} &= k \binom{n-k}{k-1} \\
\frac{(n-k)!}{k! (n

A:

You're re-using id values in your HTML.  This is invalid markup and will likely lead to undefined behavior (probably different by browser as well).  Notice this element:
<div id="hiden" class="categorry">

Since this is essentially inside a loop (repeater, datalist, etc.) it's going to render multiple times to the page.  Instead of an id, use a class:
<div class="hiden categorry">

Then just change your jQuery selector:
$('.hiden')

Of course, now you also

Q:

Actual ramifications of time acceleration

For reference, the setting is urban fantasy, with a bit of hard science thrown in. One character can manipulate time; in this setting that means he can speed up his own movement through time.
One of the things he's capable of is punching. Now, let's suppose he throws a punch which should take 1 second, but he speeds up the punch to a quarter of a second. The question is, is the force magnified fourfold, or (and this is how I think it works) since he's affecting time directly (and not just moving faster), the force is magnified by 16, because F = M*A, and A is really just m/(s^2)?
(Side note: A human punches with 1000 Newtons, so the difference here is between 4,000 (boxer's punch) or 16,000 (shatter your own fist).)

A:

Given that you're stating that this is a hard-science setting (not a hard-science question) then let's break this down a little to explain the interaction between force and time.
Your Premise
F=ma, therefore time is a consideration in the amount of force. If a person can throw a punch at normal speed BUT their localised frame of temporal reference is lower than their environment, to an outside observer the punch is faster, therefore delivers more force.
My Premise
This is just an exotic way of punching faster, delivering more force.
One interesting question I get when explaining relativity to others is why the astronaut who's travelling at close to the speed of light ages so much more slowly than his twin back on earth - if relativity is based on the observer, then the speed of both men is close to the speed of light relative to each other, right?
Right?
Well the problem with this thinking is that relativity is not about relative speed, it's about relative energy. The astronaut has a much higher kinetic energy than the earth, meaning his ageing is slower.
Thing is, it's the same with your person's fist. Your person's ability to slow down time is really just a fancy way of saying that he or she can speed up his or her own matabolism to a point where he or she is moving faster. Whether you slow down time or speed your movements up, you're still introducing the same amount of extra energy. That is to say, you're hero is going

If you don't need to breathe, what new opportunities open up for places to live?

To work around the space suits are SCUBA gear problem, I was wondering if it wouldn't make more sense to just bypass the lungs and their vent hole altogether and to oxygenate blood and remove CO2 (and possibly other exotic toxins) by routing it through an external machine.  Maybe something light you can strap to your back or arm.
I mean... babies do this for several months before they're born, right?
Now it's self-evident that bypassing the lungs and doing away with the pressure suit won't offer any protection from heat, cold, or radiation, and you'd have to deal with those by other means or avoid those situations.
What it does offer is protection from some range of noxious atmospheres, the removal of acute vulnerability to punctures, and the freedom to talk (atmosphere permitting) and eat and poop (universe permitting) and bathe and change your clothes and generally to stay in those environments for as long as you can find fresh oxygen and power for your oxygen machine (and it may be harvesting what it needs from the local environment anyway).
It also obviates a weakness of human lungs that they only work in a restricted pressure range.  A narrower range than a human might be able to endure otherwise (not a complete vacuum, but beyond 40000 ft Earth altitude).
But maybe it's not as simple as all that.  Perhaps environments that seem otherwise benign are actually substantially less survivable than it would appear.  The skin provides a porous interface to the local atmosphere, for example.  It may allow reactions with the environment that are unhealthy or dangerous, or the local environment may obstruct reactions which are essential.
Wandering about on Wikipedia, methane and carbon dioxide atmospheres seem not uncommon, but anywhere we know that well has other serious blockers for human habitation (radiation and cold, mostly; also, wrong gravity).  If not for those other problems, would they be safe environments?

A:

Addressing the question at hand...
If the body was coated in latex (yes like a condom) to maintain internal pressure, and that latex was coated with silicone for insulation/protection and that silicone was coated/covered with something abrasion resistant, you could probably survive in a vacuum. But not in space because radiation would cook you and micrometeorites would perforate you, and on the top of

I want to remove CFG from the file if any of the lines matchs a string, which could be 'cfg', 'Cfg', or other case insensitive variations.
If I read the file into a Set, how can I achieve this? It seems more feasible to do this by reading the file into a List.

A:

The following is a "lambda version" of the required code.  Thanks to @Sam for the important point about re-raising any suppressed PrintWriter IOException.
Path in_file = Paths.get("infile");
Path out_file = Paths.get("outfile");
try (PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(out_file.toFile())) {
    Files.lines(in_file)
         .filter(line -> !line.equalsIgnoreCase("cfg"))
         .forEach(pw::println);
    if (pw.checkError()) {
        throw new IOException("Exception(s) occurred in PrintWriter");
    }
}

If you need to modify the file in place, then writing to it while reading from it is somewhat more difficult.  You could read it all into memory first.
Path path = new Path("filename");
List<String> lines = Files.lines(path)
                          .filter(line -> !line.equalsIgnoreCase("cfg"))
                          .collect(Collectors.toList());

try(PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(path.toFile())) {
    lines.forEach(pw::println);
    if (pw.checkError()) {
        throw new IOException("Exception(s) occurred in PrintWriter");
    }
}

And finally, just in case, a non-lambda solution for compatibility with Java 7:
Path in_file = Paths.get("infile");
Path out_file = Paths.get("outfile");
try (BufferReader reader = Files.newBufferedReader(in_file);
         PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(out_file.toFile())) {

    String line;
    while((line = reader.readline()) != null) {
        if (!line.equalsIgnoreCase("cfg")) {
            pw.println(line);
        }
    }
    if (pw.checkError()) {
        throw new IOException("Exception(s

    f = fopen(name, "w");
    fprintf(f, "asdas\n");
    fprintf(f, "asdas\n");
    while(1){}
    return 0;
}

If I terminate this program using CTRL+C, I get an empty file named filename.
However, using
Example 2:
int main(){
    FILE *f;
    char buf[512];
    char name[128] = {"wpa_supplicant.conf"};

    f = fopen(name,"w");
    while(1){
        fprintf(f, "asdas\n");
    }
    return 0;

If I terminate this program using CTRL+C, I get file named filename, and it contains many lines with the string asdas.
Why are the strings not written to the file in the first example, but they are written to the file in the second example?

A:

In the second case, there are enough fprintf calls for the internal buffers to be flushed to disk.
With the first program, if you put a fflush(f) before the while loop, the strings will be written to the file.
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    FILE *f = fopen("filename", "w");
    if (!f) {
        perror("Failed to open 'filename' for writing");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    fprintf(f, "asdas\n");
    fprintf(f, "asdas\n");

    if ( fflush(f) != 0 ) {
        perror("Flushing output failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    while(1){}
    return 0;
}

Output:
C:\...\Temp> cl file.c

Keep in mind:

Upon successful completion, fflush() shall return 0; otherwise, it

Cancel gwt rpc call

In this example there is a pretty description of how to make a timeout logic using a Timer#schedule. But there is a pitfall there. We have 2 rpc requests: first makes a lot of computation on server(or maybe retrieving a large amount of data from database) and second a tiny request that returns results immediately. If we make first request, we will not recieve results immediately, instead we will have a timeout and after timeout we make the second tiny request and then abortFlag from example will be true, so we can retrieve the results of second request, but also we can retrieve the results of first request that was  timed out before(because the AsyncCallback object of first call was not destroyed).
So we need some kind of cancelling the first rpc call after timeout occurs. how can I do this?

A:

Let me give you an analogy.
You, the boss, made a call to a supplier, to get some product info. Supplier say they need to call you back because the info would take some time to be gathered. So, you gave them the contact of your foreman.
Your foreman waits for the call. Then you told your foreman to cancel the info request if it takes more than 30 minutes.
Your foreman thinks you are bonkers because he cannot cancel the request, because he does not have an account that gives him privilege to access the supplier's ordering system.
So, your foreman simply ignores any response from the supplier after 30 minutes. Your ingenious foreman  sets up a timer in his phone that ignores the call from the supplier after 30 minutes. Even if you killed your foreman, cut off all communication links, the vendor would still be busy servicing your request.
There is nothing on the GWT client-side to cancel. The callback is merely a javascript object waiting to be invoked. 
To cancel the call, you need to tell the server-side to stop wasting cpu resources (if that is your concern). Your server-side must be programmed to provide a service API which when invoked would cancel the job and return immediately to trigger your GWT callback.
You can refresh the page, and that would discard the page request and close the socket, but the server side would still be running. And when the server side completes its tasks and tries to perform a http response, it would fail, saying in the server logs that it had lost the client

Spring-boot @Value properties not overridden by command line arguments

I have a Maven/SpringBootApplication that takes its properties from a Spring config Server. I need to override the values of these properties using command line arguments. unfortunately, the properties keep the values provided by the config server and are not overridden by the command line arguments.

I have confirmed that the parameters are properly passed to the App as I can see being passed to SpringApplication.run. 
I can see in the function ConfigurableApplicationContext of Spring Framework the environment carrying the arguments in environment.propertysources.propertySourceList.SimpleCommandLinePropertySource.source.optionArgs
If I try to set a Spring-defined value (e.g. --logging.level.org.springframework.web=TRACE) it works, meaning Spring logs traces

I read all possible threads on the subject but none seem to apply to my problem.
This is my Spring boot app (args are beeing passed to the SpringApplication)
@SpringBootApplication
@ComponentScan("com.mycompany")
public class App {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(App.class, args);
  }
}

Here is the component and the property
@Component
public class TaskProcessor implements com.mycompnay.fwk.task.engine.TaskProcessor {

  private RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

  @Value("${mycompany.converter.converter-uri.office}")
  private String converterUriOffice;
}

The parameter being passed is received by the app (extracted from debugger):
0:"--debug=true"
1:"--logging.level.org.springframework.web=TRACE"
2:"--mycompany.converter.converter-uri.office=foo"
hash:0
value:char[44]@25

I expect the property converterUriOffice to have the value foo
Instead it gets its value from the config server (http://localhost:3000/convert/office)

Hello I have a 1:M relationship between Customer_Status and Customer. Customer_Status applies to many Customers. I put the associations in the corresponding models. 
Below is my schema
create_table "customer_statuses", force: :cascade do |t|
 t.string   "customer_status_desc"
 t.datetime "created_at",           null: false
 t.datetime "updated_at",           null: false
end

create_table "customers", force: :cascade do |t|
 t.integer  "customerstatus_id"
 t.integer  "customertype_id"
 t.string   "first_name"
 t.string   "last_name"
 t.string   "primaryemail"
 t.string   "secondaryemail"
 t.string   "billingcity"
 t.string   "billingstreet"
 t.integer  "billingzip"
 t.integer  "primaryphone"
 t.integer  "secondaryphone"
 t.datetime "created_at",        null: false
 t.datetime "updated_at",        null: false
end

In my Customer Index View I am trying to display attribute customer_status_desc from the Customer Status table instead of the customerstatus_id found in the Customers table.
In the Customer Index View I have:
<% @customers.each do |customer| %>
  <tr>
    <td><%= customer.customer_status.customer_status_desc %></td>
    <td><%= customer.customertype_id %></td>
    <td><%= customer.first_name %></td>
    <td><%= customer.last_name %></td>
  </tr>
<% end %>

For the life of me I cannot get the customer_status_desc to display. I get the error undefined method customer_status_desc for nil:NilClass I have tried naming it differently such as customer.customerstatus.customer_status_desc
After some research it appears the naming conventions are out of whack. Is there any way to resolve this without changing all of the names. Can I help rails understand what I am trying to call - or possibly force it through a query?
EDIT: 
I am using postgres and rails 4

Q:

realloc: invalid checksum for freed object

I have an error using realloc to replace malloc.
This code below runs OK on my computer.
int vector_grow(Vector* vec) {
  unsigned long newcap;
  int * newarr;

  if (0 == vec->cap) {
    vec->arr = (int*)malloc(START_CAPACITY * sizeof(*vec->arr));
    if (NULL == vec->arr)
      return -1;
    vec->cap = START_CAPACITY;
    return 0;
  }
  newarr = malloc (newcap * sizeof(*vec->arr));
  if (NULL == newarr)
    return -1;

  memcpy (newarr, vec->arr, vec->len * sizeof(*vec->arr));
  free (vec->arr);
  vec->arr = newarr;
  vec->cap = newcap;

  return 0;
}

I want to change the malloc to realloc, but the error occurs.
int vector_grow(Vector* vec) {
  unsigned long newcap;

  if (0 == vec->cap) {
    vec->arr = (int*)malloc(START_CAPACITY * sizeof(*vec->arr));
    if (NULL == vec->arr)
      return -1;
    vec->cap = START_CAPACITY;
    return 0;
  }
  newcap = 2 * vec->cap;
  if ((vec->arr = (int*)realloc(vec->arr, newcap * sizeof(int))) == NULL)
    return -1;
return 0;
}

It says

malloc: *** error for object 0x7fca64c02598: incorrect checksum for freed object - object was probably modified after being freed.

I don't know any difference between those two snippets of code, if you know what causes the error, please tell me! Thank you very much!

A:

Bug in missing vec->cap = in updated code certainly contribute to various calls to malloc() and calling code's misuse of data.

Given $A\in M_{6} (\mathbb{Q})$ and $f(x)=2x^9+x^8+5x^3+x+a$, for what values of $a$ is $f(A)$ invertible?

Let $A \in \mathbb{Q}^{6 \times 6}$ be the block matrix below:
$$A=\left(\begin{array}{rrrr|rr}
-3 &3  &2  &2  & 0 & 0\\ 
-1 &0  &1  &1  & 0 & 0\\ 
 -1&0  &0  &1  & 0 & 0\\ 
 -4&6  &4  &3  & 0 & 0\\ 
\hline
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &  0 &1 \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -9 &6 
\end{array}\right).$$
I found out that the minimal polynomial of $A$ is $(x-3)^3(x+1)^2$, and now  let
$$f(x)=2x^9+x^8+5x^3+x+a$$
a polynomial, $a\in N$. I need to find out for which $a$ the matrix $f(A)$ is invertible.
It has some similarity to to my last question, but I still can't understand and solve it. Thanks again.

A:

Expanding on the comment: 
If $A$ has eigenvalue $\lambda$, then $f(A)$ has eigenvalue $f(\lambda)$. So $f(A)$ is not invertible if $f(\lambda)=0$. 

A:

Theorem. Let $V$ be a finite $\mathbb{K}$-vector space and let $f \in \mathrm{End}(V)$ an endomorphism with minimal polynomial $m_f(t) \in \mathbb{K}[t]$. If $a(t) \in \mathbb{K}[t]$, then $a(f) \in \mathrm{GL}(V)$ if and only if $\gcd(a,m_f)=1$.
Proof. $\Leftarrow$) Since Bezout's identity, $1 = \lambda m_f + \mu a$ for some polynomials $\lambda, \mu$. So, evaluating in $f$, one has $\mathrm

And id like to convert it to an object with the timestamps as the keys, and arrays of objects corresponding to that date. If that key already exists, then add the object to the corresponding array associated with that key
 {
   1541482236000: 
     [{
           "id": "-LP9_kAbqnsQwXq0oGDT",
           "value": Object {
             "date": 1541482236000,
             "title": "First",
           },
         },
         {
           "id": "-LP9_kAbqnsQwXqZZZZ",
           "value": Object {
             "date": 1541482236000,
             "title": "Some other title",
           },
         },
        .... more objects here
     ],
  1541482236001: 
     [{
           "id": "-LP9_kAbqnsQ1234",
           "value": Object {
             "date": 1541482236001,
             "title": "Another title",
           },
         },

        .... more objects here
     ]
 }

I was able to achieve something similar using reduce. However it does not handle adding objects to the array when their key already exists. 
calendarReminders = action.value.reduce((obj, reminder) => {
                dateKey = moment(reminder.value.date).format('YYYY-MM-DD')
                obj[dateKey] = [reminder]
                return obj;
            }, {});

How can I do this?

A:

You just need to check whether the object is already a key and if not add it with the value of an array. Then you can just push() into it:

let arr = [{"id": "-LP9_kAbqnsQwXq0oGDT","value":  {"date": 1541482236000,"title": "First",},},{"id": "SomID","value":  {"date": 1541482236000,"title": "Some other title",},},{"id": "A different ID","value":  {"date": 1541482236001,"title": "A third title",},}]

 let calendarReminders = arr.reduce((obj, reminder) => {
    

With the little bit of code you've shown, you're doing a number of things wrong.
Based on this line:
imageViewTutorial.image = UIImage(named: tutorialImages[I])

it looks like you have one UIImageView and you are setting its .image property 3 times, instead of creating 3 different image views.
Also, there is nothing in your code indicating how you are setting the frames of the image views.
I highly recommend using auto-layout instead of explicit frames - makes things much, much easier going forward.
Here is a complete example. It will create a square (1:1 ratio) scroll view 20-pts from the top with 20-pts padding on each side, and a UIPageControl below. It then adds a horizontal UIStackView to the scroll view. That stack view will hold the image views. Once the image views are added, the stack view will automatically define the "scrollable area" -- no need for calculating .contentSize.
Here's what it will look like:

Everything is done in code, so just assign the class of an empty view controller to SlidesExampleViewController ... no @IBOutlet or @IBAction connections needed.
class SlidesExampleViewController: UIViewController, UIScrollViewDelegate {

    lazy var pageControl: UIPageControl = {
        let v = UIPageControl()
        v.backgroundColor = .brown
        return v
    }()

    lazy var scrollView: UIScrollView = {
        let v = UIScrollView(frame: .zero)
        v.backgroundColor = .yellow
        v.delegate = self
        return v
    }()

    lazy var stackView: UIStackView = {
        let v = UIStackView()
        v.axis = .horizontal
        v.alignment = .fill
        v.distribution = .fill
        v.spacing = 0
        return v
    }()

    let tutorialImages: [String] = ["1", "2", "3"]

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        view.backgroundColor = .white

        scrollView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        stackView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        pageControl.translatesAutores

Hi I'm working on a software project for work that inflects english words into their various derived forms. e.g. work (verb) -> works, working, worked. My main problem at the moment is that I need to standardize some naming conventions or categories for each inflection type in my program, and then funnel scraped data from across the internet into these categories.
For nouns it was fairly easy since there is just plural and possessive (correct me at any point if there is an error).
For adjectives I have base form, superlative, and comparative.
For verbs the situation is more complicated. I have a mood -> tense -> person -> number hierarchy currently that was brought over from the Italian language system. I want to be clear that I do not need a category for every possible combination, and I do not need separate categories for conjugations that use auxiliary verbs, only those which inflect the verb's form. I want a minimum set of categories that will fully describe all possible flexed regular & irregular verb forms. For instance from what I can tell https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/be#Conjugation "be" is the most irregular verb and has 8 different forms, so ideally I'd like to have at most 8 categories. 
At the moment, when I say "category" I mean a single combination of multiple "aspects". Sorry if I am using jargon loosely or improperly, I'm learning things as I do research for this project.
So far I have the following jumble of aspects:
Moods: indicative, imperative, subjunctive, infinitive, participle
Tenses: present, past, preterite
Persons: first person, second person, third person
Number: singular, plural
An example of a category might be indicative, present, third person, singular for work -> works.
I do not need to keep this hierarchy, I can use any flat or nested structure necessary. However, I need to know how a standard conjugation table (from wiktionary for example) might map onto it.
Currently I'm most worried about moods and tenses. For instance is the preterite identical to the past form? I understand that it's used to describe a different tense but it seems like the base inflection is the same. Can I get rid of one, and if so which?
The moods were mostly just copied and pasted

Here is the DEMO of my code please have a look. 

A:

$(this).toggleClass("active"); inside the $(document).on("click") will not contain the .navbar-toggle class. But it will hold the document element. Because this is inside another function.
Also, you have to check if you didn't click the element itself. If you delete
if(!$(event.target).closest('.navbar-toggle').length)

The class gets added, but directly deleted. if ($('.navbar-toggle').hasClass('active') ) returns true, because you added that class few lines before. So it deletes it.

$(document).ready(function () {
  $(".navbar-toggle").on("click", function () {
    $(this).toggleClass("active");
  });
   $(document).on('click',function(){
   if(!$(event.target).closest('.navbar-toggle').length) {
      if ($('.navbar-toggle').hasClass('active') ) {
        $('.collapse').collapse('hide');
        $(".navbar-toggle").toggleClass("active");
      }
      }
  });

I am trying to call in two partial views but my program is trying to populate my web grid before I pass it a search parameter. I can't figure out how to keep it from trying to render the webgrid before I pass it the text in the searchbox. 
This is in my partial view:
<div class="webgrid-wrapper">
    <div class="webgrid-title">Values</div>
    <div id="grid">
        @grid.GetHtml(
tableStyle: "webgrid",
        headerStyle: "webgrid-header",
        footerStyle: "webgrid-footer",
        alternatingRowStyle: "webgrid-alternating-rows",
        columns: grid.Columns(
            grid.Column("Id", "ID"),
            grid.Column("Name", "Name")
        )
        )
</div>
</div>
</div>

This is my Home view where I'm pulling both of the partial views into:
    <section class="featured">
    <div class="content-wrapper">
        <hgroup class="title">
            <h1>@ViewBag.Title</h1>
            <h2>@ViewBag.Message</h2>
        </hgroup>
    </div>
</section>
@using (Html.BeginForm("Analysis", "Home", "POST"))
{
<div class="searchField">
    <div class="searchbox">
        Search: <input type="text" name="Search" />
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </div>
</div>
}

 @Html.Partial("PartialChemAnalysis")
 @Html.Partial("PartialSlagView")

A:

you can do this by checking the search parameter if it has a value, if no, then you dont have to render the grid.
in your controller
public ViewResult Analysis(string search) {
        ViewBag.DisplayGrid = !string.IsNullOrEmpty(search);
        //do you logics then return
    }

in your view
  @if (ViewBag.DisplayGrid != null && ViewBag.DisplayGrid) {
        //Render your partial since its true.
          @Html.Partial("PartialChemAnalysis")
          @Html.

Is there a way to include an external Params block in a Rails Grape resource?

I'm using Ruby on Rails 4 and Grape.

    }

    let page = renderOutput(ctx, finalState, reactHelmet);

A:

From the docs of redux-thunk, if you define your action like this:
function makeASandwichWithSecretSauce(forPerson) {

  // Invert control!
  // Return a function that accepts `dispatch` so we can dispatch later.
  // Thunk middleware knows how to turn thunk async actions into actions.

  return function (dispatch) {
    return fetchSecretSauce().then(
      sauce => dispatch(makeASandwich(forPerson, sauce)),
      error => dispatch(apologize('The Sandwich Shop', forPerson, error))
    );
  };
}

you can then use it like this
store.dispatch(
  makeASandwichWithSecretSauce('My wife')
).then(() => {
  console.log('Done!');
});

Which means, on the server side you can do
store.dispatch(makeASandwichWithSecretSauce("My wife")).then(() => {

  const ctx = ReactDomServer.renderToString(
    <Provider store={store}>
      <StaticRouter context={context} location={req.url}>
        <App />
      </StaticRouter>
    </Provider>
  );

Q:

$X$ a normal r.v , calculating $\mathbb{E}(e^{\lambda X})$

$X\sim { \mathcal{N}( \mu , \sigma^2) } $ 
a normal r.v,  $Y = \frac{X-\mu}{\sigma} $
The solution says $\mathbb{E}(e^{\lambda X})= \mathbb{E}(e^{\sigma \lambda Y}) e^{\lambda \mu} = e^{\sigma^2 \lambda^2 + \lambda \mu} $
But what I find is :
$\mathbb{E}(e^{\lambda X}) = e^{ \frac{ \sigma^2 \lambda^2}{2} + \lambda \mu} $
I can't see that I made a calculation mistake:
$ \mathbb{E}( \frac{X-\mu}{\sigma} ) = \int y \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-y^2/2} $ which gives $Y$ ~ ${ \mathcal{N}( 0 , 1) } $ 
$ \mathbb{E}(e^{ \lambda Y} ) = \int e^{\lambda y} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-y^2/2} = e^{\lambda^2/2} \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-(y-\lambda)^2/2} = e^{\lambda^2/2}$
Now for $e^{\lambda X}$:
$ \mathbb{E}(e^{ \lambda X} ) = \mathbb{E}(e^{ \lambda \sigma Y + \mu \lambda} ) $
$= e^{\lambda \mu}\mathbb{E}(e^{ \lambda \sigma Y } ) 
$
$= e^{\lambda \mu} \int e^{\lambda \sigma y } \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-y^2/2} $
$= e^{\lambda \mu + \mu ^2\lambda^2/2} \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-(y-\sigma \lambda)^2/2} = e^{\lambda \mu + \mu ^2\lambda^2/2}$
EDIT : I made a typing mistake, I meant :
$= e^{\lambda \mu + \sigma ^2\lambda^2/2

So i have a csv file:
Today</span><span class='invisible'>3:00 p.m. Nov. 29, 2013
Today</span><span class='invisible'>1:52 p.m. Nov. 29, 2013
Today</span><span class='invisible'>12:50 p.m. Nov. 29, 2013
Today</span><span class='invisible'>11:42 a.m. Nov. 29, 2013
Today</span><span class='invisible'>9:56 a.m. Nov. 29, 2013
Nov. 27, 2013
Nov. 27, 2013
Nov. 27, 2013
Nov. 27, 2013
Nov. 25, 2013

and I need to replace all the rows that start with Today and replace it with the date that is currently in the line. So far I've been running a for-loop:
rownumber=$(wc -l < DateStamp.csv)
for ((i=1; i<=$rownumber; i++))
do
    s1=$(awk -v "row=$i" -F'@' 'NR == row { print $1 }' DateStamp.csv)
    if [[ "$s1" =~ 'Today' ]]
        then
            year=$(date +'%Y')
            text=$(awk -v "row=$i" -F'@' 'NR == row { print $1 }' DateStamp.csv | grep -o -P "(?<=m\. ).*(?<=$year)")
                            __SOME COMMAND__
        else
            break
    fi
done

I want my output to be this:
Nov. 29, 2013
Nov. 29, 2013
Nov. 29, 2013
Nov. 29, 2013
Nov. 29, 2013
Nov. 27, 2013
Nov. 27, 2013
Nov. 27, 2013
Nov. 27, 2013
Nov. 25, 2013

Is there a line which I can replace with SOME COMMAND that will replace the row I am in with my variable text? Maybe a sed or awk command?

A:

Assuming that the presence of a.m. or p.m. in front of the date is guaranteed, do you really need to parse and extract the date from the Today lines? The following may suffice
sed 's/.*[ap

  var $next=$("#"+togglerid+" .next")
  var $prev=$("#"+togglerid+" .prev")
  $next.click(function(){
   fadecontentviewer.fade($allcontents, togglerid, $(this).attr('nextpage'), speed)
   return false
  })
  $prev.click(function(){
   fadecontentviewer.fade($allcontents, togglerid, $(this).attr('previouspage'), speed)
   return false
  })
  $toc.click(function(){
   fadecontentviewer.fade($allcontents, togglerid, $(this).attr('pagenumber'), speed)
   return false
  })
 },

 init:function(fadeid, contentclass, togglerid, selected, speed){
  $(document).ready(function(){
   var faderheight=$("#"+fadeid).height()
   var $fadecontents=$("#"+fadeid+" ."+contentclass)
   $fadecontents.css({top: 0, left: 0, height: faderheight, visibility: 'hidden'})
   fadecontentviewer.setuptoggler($fadecontents, togglerid, speed)
   setTimeout(function(){fadecontentviewer.fade($fadecontents, togglerid, selected, speed)}, 100)
   $(window).bind('unload', function(){ //clean up
    $("#"+togglerid+" .toc").unbind('click')
    $("#"+togglerid+" .next", "#"+togglerid+" .prev").unbind('click')
   })
  })
 }
}

A:

When you have jQuery specific code that is using $, the simplest way is to wrap the code with the following:
// Disable the $ global alias completely
jQuery.noConflict();

// For jQuery scripts
(function($){

// set a local $ variable only available in this block as an alias to jQuery
... here is your jQuery specific code ...

})(jQuery);

// For Mootols scripts
(function($){

// set a local $ variable only available in this block as an alias 
// to Mootools document.id
... here is your Mootools specific code ...

})(document

Q:

Add java-program (Eclipse,JabRef,Maple,...) to favorites on Ubuntu

If I create a Java-desktop-file in ~/.local/share/applications I do not have the option "Add to Favorites".
I tried it with JabRef:
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Terminal=false
Icon=org-jabref-jabrefmain.png
Path=/home/jkalliau/prgm/JabRef
Exec=java -jar JabRef--master--latest.jar %U
Name=JabRef
GenericName=BibTeX Editor
Comment=JabRef is an open source bibliography reference manager.
Keywords=bibtex;biblatex;latex;bibliography
Categories=Office;
StartupWMClass=org-jabref-JabRefMain
MimeType=text/x-bibtex;

and with Maple:
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=Maple 2018
Type=Application
Comment=Maple 2018
Exec=/home/jkalliau/maple2018/bin/xmaple %f
Terminal=false
Icon=/home/jkalliau/maple2018/bin/Maple2018.png
GenericName=Maple
Categories=Applications;Education;Mathematics;
MimeType=application/x-maple-worksheet;

If I do the same as in How to add Eclipse to Favorites? I have the icon twice, once added to favorites and once the opened file.

A:

Create a .desktop-file with the identical name of the opened program:

for JabRef: org.jabref.JabRefMain.desktop
for Maple: java-lang-Thread.desktop
for Eclipse: eclipse.desktop (according to https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/59654/241592 )

You can see name in the left upper corner

or in the Pop-up of the icon in the favourite-list

As suggest on https://askubuntu.com/a/1120331/676490 after creation of the .desktop-file:

go to activities

search the application

When adding a link post in Facebook, a nice looking description (containing a snippet of text from the linked page) and thumbnail are automatically added to the post.
Is there a way to do this automatically using the Facebook API?  I am inclined to think that there is not, because posts added by IFTTT, a popular web application that uses the Facebook API, do not contain descriptions.  I am unclear as to whether this is a limitation with the Facebook API, and whether there is any way around it.

A:

Yes, it's possible. You can use the Graph Api Method /profile_id/feed. The method receives the arguments message, picture, link, name, caption, description, source, place and tags. The facebook organize the parameters in a "nice looking summary and thumbnail".
You can get more information in the publishing section in the link http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/
In c#:
        public static bool Share(string oauth_token, string message, string name, string link, string picture)
        {
            try
            {
                string url =
                    "https://graph.facebook.com/me/feed" +
                    "?access_token=" + oauth_token;

                StringBuilder post = new StringBuilder();
                post.AppendFormat("message={0}", HttpUtility.UrlEncode(message));
                post.AppendFormat("&name={0}", HttpUtility.UrlEncode(name));
                post.AppendFormat("&link={0}", HttpUtility.UrlEncode(link));
                post.AppendFormat("&picture={0}", HttpUtility.UrlEncode(picture));

                string result = Post(url, post.ToString());
            }
            catch (Exception)
            {
                return false;
            }

            return true;

            webRequest.Method = "POST";

            byte[] bytes = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(post);

            webRequest.ContentLength = bytes.Length;

A:

The .progress-bar should be made position: absolute with height: 100%; inside a position:relative parent  (our .progress) with auto height - in order to let the inner text/content dictate it's height.  
The text should be than moved inside a separate element like i.e: .progress-label

.progress {
  position:relative; /* add! */
  width: 100px;
  background-color: black !important;
  height: auto !important; /* add! (let text dictate height! ) */
}

.progress-bar { /* Added styles */
  position: absolute;
  height: 100%;
}

.progress-label { /* added element and CSS */
  position: relative;
  color: #fff;

Serialized Data

I'm trying to add data to a serialized string - 
I get the serialized string from my database - e.g. a:1:{i:0;s:2:"32";}
Unserialize it
add a value to it e.g. 128
serialize it and save it back
But I get 
s:33:"a:2:{i:0;s:2:"64";i:1;s:3:"128";}";
Where did the s:33 come into it and surrounded the rest in quotes and ends with a semi colon?
    function addItem($serializedArray, $item)
    {
       $a = unserialize($serializedArray);
       $a[] = $item;
       return serialize($a);
     }

    $lp = $wpdb->get_results( $wpdb->prepare("Select MemNo from YP_Members Limit 0,    10") );

      foreach ($lp as $userid){
       $user_id = $userid->MemNo;
        $meta_value = $wpdb->get_var( $wpdb->prepare("Select meta_value from  iropiusermeta Where meta_key = 'user_iro_area' AND user_id = $user_id") );

        echo "User=".$user_id."<br />Value=".$meta_value."<br />";

                       if ($meta_value){

                            $user_iro_area = addItem($meta_value, "128");
                            update_user_meta($user_id, 'user_iro_area_new', $user_iro_area);    

                        } else {
                        // Add meta_key user_iro_area
                        echo "<b>Add New Me</b><br />";
                        $iro_group_num[] = "128";
                        $user_iro_area = serialize($iro_group_num);
                                         update_user_meta($user_id, 'user_iro_area_new', $user_iro_area);   
                        }                           

} // End of Main While Loop

your meta value is getting serialized twice, you should pass update_user_meta an array, not a serialized string. and while you're

The first thing I would do is change your constructor:
private readonly NetworkCredential credentials;

public ftpHelper(string ftpHostname, string ftpUsername, string ftpPassword)
{
    credentials = new NetworkCredential(ftpUsername, ftpPassword);
    Hostname = ftpHostname;
}

That eliminates newing up credentials all over your code.
As for the rest of your code, I think a few well named functions will make the code much more readable. For example, getting a list of files:
private IEnumerable<string> ListDirectories(string remoteFtpPath)
{
    var url = $"ftp://{Hostname}{remoteFtpPath}"; // Is this right? Not used C#6 yet...

    var request = (FtpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(url);
    request.Method = WebRequestMethods.Ftp.ListDirectory;
    request.Credentials = credentials;
    request.Proxy = null;
    
    var directories = new List<string>();
     
    using (var response = (FtpWebResponse)request.GetResponse())
    using (var responseStream = response.GetResponseStream())
    using (var reader = new StreamReader(responseStream))
    {
        while (!reader.EndOfStream)
        {
            directories.Add(line); 
        }
    }
    return directories;
}

You could write the above using yield

I use delphi 2010 and clever internet suite component i upload a file and want to calculate the upload speed..

A:

As you encountered, the resolution of the system timer isnt very good.  I seem to recall that it can be as low as 50ms.  Here's two ways to get around this, some of it depends on how your program is structured.
One, you can use a regular TTimer set to 2 second or whatever interval you'd like.  Each time that fires you get the byte count, compare it to the last time the timing event fired, and set the caption with the upload rate.  This would obviously only work if you're dealing with non-blocking uploads.  If you dont want to use a TTimer, you can also do this in a separate thread, and have that check the upload every couple of seconds.
Another way is to keep doing what you are doing, but only update the upload rate after a second.  What I'd recommend is using GetTickCount() instead of Now() (since you dont actually need the date, just a counter).  GetTickCount() brings back an integer representing milliseconds, not a floating point value.  Start a byte count at 0.

MSSQL2014 & python 3.7.3: Trying to get stored procedure return value results in "No results. Previous SQL was not a query."

I'm running a python script which connects to a MSSQL database, runs a stored procedure and should take a some actions depending on the stored procedure return value. Here's the code:
'''
sql = """\
        SET NOCOUNT ON
        DECLARE @rv INT
        EXEC @rv = [MY_DB].[dbo].[sp_Load_Actuals]
        SELECT @rv 
        """
...
conn = pyodbc.connect('Driver={ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server};'
                                      'Server=MY_SERVER;'
                                      'Database=MY_DB;'
                                      'Trusted_Connection=yes;')

conn.autocommit = True
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute(sql)
retv = cursor.fetchone() 
...

On the execution of the last statement I'm catching the pyodbc.DatabaseError exception with the message  "No results. Previous SQL was not a query." I have read all related articles here, but apparently I'm still doing something wrong. 
What do I miss?

A:

You have to call cursor.nextset() to skip past any info messages that were output by the called stored procedures, as NOCOUNT ON is not enough here.   
But unfortunately cursor doesn't have a .hasrows() method, so you have to catch the exception in a loop.
EG:
import pyodbc

sql = """\
        SET NOCOUNT ON
        DECLARE @rv INT
        EXEC @rv = sp_executesql N'print ''informational message'''

        """

conn = pyodbc.connect('Driver={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};'
                                      'Server=localhost;'
                                      'Database=tempdb;'
                                      'Trusted_Connection=yes;')

conn.autocommit = True
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute(sql)

while True:
    try:
        retv = cursor.fetchone() 
        break
    except pyodbc.ProgrammingError as e:

Why is the single-rear derailleur that enables <= 12 speeds so popular?

All the high-end MTB, and road racers seem to have somewhere between ... 6 and 12 gears. NO derailleur up-front, only a few to scroll through in back. I get the KISS principle behind it; I like having first gear made extra-extra large to make up for missing lower gear elsewhere. Seriously why is this so popular? All the $5000+ bikes have ONE deralleur and limited gears. Is it really better to design gearsets this way? Why? Is it faster? More durable? 

A:

Any less than 21 speeds for that kind of jack seems wasteful to me.

You must understand that what matters is not how much "speeds" drivetrain offers, but the available range and other factors (see below). Let's compare 3x7 13-30 24-32-42 and 1x12 10-50 36: 3x7 has 404% range versus 500% range of 1x12. That's a 96% difference! 1x12 will also be lighter by at least several hundred grams. The quality of parts will also be generally higher, given that there are no modern high end 3x7 complete groups. Even compared to a 2x10 11-36 28-38 444% 1x12 has a wider range.

Seriously why is this so popular?

Why people choose one-by:

Similar or wider range with reduced simplicity.
Weight reduction.
Frees up bar space for remote control levers (suspension lockout, adjustable seatpost).
Availability. SRAM does not offer 2x12 or 3x12.

And why not:

Cost (in some cases).
Maybe a reduced service life. A lot of factors contribute to this, I think it's a complex matter.
Limited availability. Good luck finding a replacement 12 speed chain in third-world nowhere.

Is this a fad? Is it really better to design gearsets this way? Why? Cuz Shimano said? Is it faster? More durable?

It's a legitimate trend that offers benefits for some people at cost that other people might not find acceptable. A general advice would be to use what you find suitable for your application scenarios. Manufacturers might have their own reasons to reduce front gears amount, hype/trends and manufacturing costs being

I have added a category to my NSManagedObject IBCompany, which should retrieve a specific time period, which is one of the IBCompany's relationships, based on a simple date comparison.
When I run the following code, the NSArray sortedFinPeriodsDesc contains the faulted periods in the correct sorted order. However, when accessing them in the for each loop, each of the periods returns nil for its attributes, and in particular, nil for its EndDate. For this reason my method lastReportedPeriodforDate always returns nil, which is an error.
#import "IBCompany+FinstatAccessors.h"

@implementation IBCompany (FinstatAccessors)

NSArray *sortedFinPeriodsDesc;

- (IBFinPeriod*)lastReportedPeriodforDate:(NSDate*)date;
{
    if ( !sortedFinPeriodsDesc ) {
        NSSortDescriptor *sortDescriptor = [NSSortDescriptor sortDescriptorWithKey:@"EndDate" ascending:NO];
        sortedFinPeriodsDesc = [self.finperiod sortedArrayUsingDescriptors:[NSArray arrayWithObject:sortDescriptor]];
        }   
    IBFinPeriod *lastPeriod;
    for (IBFinPeriod *finPeriod in sortedFinPeriodsDesc) {
        if ( [finPeriod.EndDate compare:date] == NSOrderedAscending ){ // finPeriod.EndDate < date
            lastPeriod = finPeriod;
            break;
        }
    }
    return lastPeriod;
}

However, when replacing the first lines (lazy instantiation) in the method by removing the if clause and always instantiating and sorting NSArray sortedFinPeriodsDesc, the code works fine.
Hence, I have a couple of questions:

What is the error in my code? How does affect lazy instantiation
faulting?
Would you recommend defining the NSArray sortedFinPeriodsDesc as transient attribute and sorting it in awakeFromFetch instead? 
What would be the best option in your view?

Thank you very much for your help!

A:

The "lazy loading" smacks of a premature optimisation. Particularly the way you've implemented it, you aren't actually using an instance variable, but a global variable (see here for details), meaning that each object isn't holding its own version of

The following does not completely answer OP's question, rather, this is going to be a clarification of subtleties and difficulties on the issue. Notice that sometimes I am going to use the same notations as OP used, but not necessarily the exact same meanings and I will make them clear in the context.
The usage of "wavefunction"
It has two possible meanings when people refer to something as wavefunctions :
(1). The collection of some functions $g(x)$ furnishes a positive-energy, unitary representation of the underlying symmetry group(in our case just the Poincare group). 
(2). In addition to (1) being satisfied, we should be able to interpret $|g(x)|^2$ as the probability distribution of finding the particle in $(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}+d\mathbf{x})$. It really has to be of the form $|g(x)|^2$ according to the standard axioms of quantum mechanics, provided you interpret $g(x)$ as an inner product $\langle x|g\rangle$ where $\langle x|$ is an eigen bra of the position operator. I will discuss what position operator means later.
The 2nd meaning is of course much stronger and OP is searching for a wavefunction in this sense. However, the $\psi(x)$ written by OP is only a  wavefunction in the 1st sense, because clearly $\langle 0|\phi(x)$ cannot be eigen bras of any Hermitian position operator, easily seen from the fact that they are not even mutually orthogonal, i.e.   $\langle 0|\phi(x)\phi^\dagger(y)|0\rangle\neq0$ even when $x$ and $y$ are spacelike separated. As a consequence, $\int d^3\mathbf{x}|\psi(x)|^2\neq1$ as OP has already noted. Moreover, $|\psi(x)|^2$ is invariant under Lorentz transformation, but a density distribution should transform like the 0th component of a 4-vector in relativistic space-time, as OP has also noticed.
The localized states and position operator(Newton-Wigner)
In this section I will mostly rephrase(for conceptual clarity in sacrifice of technical clarity) what is written in this paper.
What is a sensible definition of position operator of single-particle states? First we need to think about what the most spatially-localized states are, and then it would be natural to call these states

Eliminate duplicate rows from query output

I have a large SELECT query with multiple JOINS and WHERE clauses. Despite specifying DISTINCT (also have tried GROUP BY) - there are duplicate rows returned. I am assuming this is because the query selects several IDs from several tables. At any rate, I would like to know if there is a way to remove duplicate rows from a result set, based on a condition.
I am looking to remove duplicates from results if x.ID appears more than once. The duplicate rows all appear grouped together with the same IDs.

SQLite VFS implementation guide lines with FOpen*

I am about to implement a custom VFS (virtual file system) for a Netburner embedded device (non windows) using FOpen, FRead, FWrite, FSeek, and FClose. I was surprised that i could not find a FOpen* version of the VFS available. It would make it a lot more portable to embedded devices. 
I found some information on creating the VFS for SQLite here 
http://sqlite.org/c3ref/vfs.html
but the information is very detailed and I have lots of other questions about the implementation. 
I have some example VFS in the SQLite source code for Win, OS2, Linux but they don't have a lot of comments, only source code. 
I could use the information provided in the link above and the examples to create my custom VFS but i'm sure that I would miss something if I did it that way. 
My questions are:

Is there any more documentation about the SQLite VFS that I am missing? Maybe an implementation guide?
Is there an Fopen version of the SQLite VFS that is available? 
Is there a unit testing code available to test my custom SQLite VFS once I have created it?
Suggestions, comments, experiences with implementing SQLite VFS that you would like to share. 

A:

Did you notice that there is an additional source of documentation in the header file sqlite3.h? Also, Google code search is your friend.
Don't worry too much about missing things, this is what the test suite is for. Take a guess at the purpose of every method from their name, the documentation and the example implementations; go for a first-draft implementation; run the tests on your target platform; iterate until the bar is green. From a cursory reading of the interface doc that you quoted, here are some educated guesses:
  int (*xOpen)(sqlite3_vfs*, const char *zName, sqlite3_file*,
               int flags, int *pOutFlags);
  int (*xDelete)(sqlite3_vfs*, const char *zName, int syncDir);
  int (*xAccess)(sqlite3_vfs*, const char *zName, int flags, int *pResOut);
  int (*xFullPathname

or one preg_match?
if (preg_match('hello'||'i am'||'dumb', $ohreally)) {return false}   
   else {return true};

I know the preg_match code is wrong, i would really appreciate if someone could offer the correct version of it. 
Thank You!

Answer
Please read what cletus said and the test middaparka did bellow. I also did a mirco time test, on various strings, long and short. with these results  
IF, you know the probability of the string values occurring ORDER them from most probable to least. (I did not notice a presentable different in ordering the regex itself i.e. between /hello|i am|dumb/ or /i am|dumb|hello/.
On the other hand in sequential strpos the probability makes all the difference. For example if 'hello' happens 90%, 'i am' 7% and 'dumb' 3 percent of the time. you would like to organize your code to check for 'hello' first and exit the function as soon as possible.  
my microtime tests show this.
for haystacks A, B, and C in which the needle is found respectively on the first, second, and third strpos() execution, the times are as follows,   
strpos:
A: 0.00450 seconds // 1 strpos()
B: 0.00911 seconds // 2 strpos()
C: 0.00833 seconds // 3 strpos()
C: 0.01180 seconds // 4 strpos() added one extra 
and for preg_match:
A: 0.01919 seconds  // 1 preg_match()
B: 0.02252 seconds  // 1 preg_match()
C: 0.01060 seconds  // 1 preg_match()  
as the numbers show, strpos is faster up to the 4rth execution, so i will be using it instead since i have only 3, sub-stings to check for : )

A:

The correct syntax is:
preg_match('/hello|i am|dumb/', $ohreally);

I doubt there's much in it either way but it wouldn't surprise me if the strpos() method is faster depending on the number of strings you're searching for. The performance of strpos()

Analog computing vs Numerical simulation

Does the electronic circuit equivalent of a mathematical model have any inherent advantage over numerical simulation of the same model ?
For instance, if I numerically simulate the Navier-Stokes equation and obtain a time-series of the velocity field and compare with the time-series of the voltage from an electronic circuit equivalent of the Navier-Stokes equation.

A:

Does the electronic circuit equivalent of a mathematical model have any inherent advantage over numerical simulation of the same model ?

I've bolded the most important word in your question. 
Yes, there are a few advantages, but as an electrical engineer you always work with trade-offs. Meaning that you gain X but lose Y, you can't have both X and Y, unless you increase $. I will mention some advantages first, and then all the disadvantages. 

Precision is one advantage that Jonk mentioned a little bit in his comment. Instead of dealing with number of bits in a data type, such as a float (32 bit) or a double (64 bit) or a long double (128 bit). Instead you are dealing with planck units which is the smallest value anything can have, be it mass, length, time, charge and temperature. We are interested in time and charge, because those two relate to the only part we are interested in when it comes to implementing the mathematical equation in an equivalent electronic circuit.
To put some numbers to it, the Planck time is about \$5.4\times10^{-44}\text{ s}\$, and the Planck charge is about \$1.9\times10^{-18}\text{ C}\$. These are the values that the universe is using to quantify these units, meaning that if you can represent these values then you can make a perfect prediction of the real world, iff you ignore all the noise.
A float can approximate a Planck charge with some error, this is called quantization noise (which is a small error), which will show up as noise, error, whatever you want to call it, unwanted effects. Which will appear if you try to do it with a digital computer. A float doesn't have enough bits to start representing a Planck time. A double can approximate the constant Planck charge and Planck time with some less error. So you can use a long double or use some custom library, sure, go for it. But you will still never be able to represent the constants exactly because we are using base 2 and the constants are

Bank function, where new account gets $5, but when the withdraw is larger than balance, it doesnt take away the balance and gives error

  public void depos(double amount)                                      
  {                                     
    balance = balance + amount;

  {                                     
    balance = balance - amount; 
    if (withd>balance){

Main:
public class Main{                                      
  public static void main(String[] args){                                       
    Acc newBank = new Acc(50);                                      
    newBank.withd(20);                                      
    newBank.depos(5);

  }                                     
}

Basically I wanted to create a function to withdraw and deposit a value from stored in balance, where $5 is added to every new account created. It seems to work, however I wanted to extend and make it so withdrawing more than the balance amount would give an error and not take away from the balance

A:

First, there are inconsistencies in the code you provided, which makes it impossible to compile:

The first constructor is public Account() while the class name is Acc
As pointed out by @Andy Turner, you are using the method name withd in the condition. It should rather be amount > balance.

If I understand what you are trying to do, the withdraw method should be:
public void withd(double amount)                                      
  {
      if (amount > balance) {
        System.out.println("Error");
      } else {
        balance = balance - amount;  
      }
  }

where you check if the balance has enough

Q:

Get scroll value on element with position:fixed

I have a page with a header section. In it, two blocks that move sideways after scrolling or dragging on the mobile.
I am trying to set the scrolling for the header, but I want too that the rest of the page stays in place until the side blocks reach left: -50% and right:-50%.
I have an event scroll set to header, with pageYoffset values.
I tried to set the rest of the content the page gives to the section with the position:fixed, but then the scroll does not work anymore, and do not count pageYoffset. 
Do you have any ideas how to get around it, so that the rest of the page would scroll only after the full unveiling of the header?
(in short, the pink section should be on top and wait until the header disappears)
let current = $(window).scrollTop();
let windowHeight = $(window).height();
let eleLeft = $(".cd-half-left");
let eleRight = $(".cd-half-right");
let currPositionLeft = eleLeft.position().left;
let currPositionRight = eleRight.position().right;
let headerHeaight = $(".cd-section").height();
let halfBlockWidth = $(".cd-half-block").width();
let windowWidth = $(window).width();

$(window).scroll(function (event) {
    current = $(window).scrollTop();
    console.log({total:total,current:current});

    var newPosition =  ((current / headerHeaight)*100) / 2;

    console.log(newPosition);

    eleLeft.css({left:"-"+newPosition+'%'});
    eleRight.css({right:"-"+newPosition+'%'});
});

FIDDLE

A:

A solution would be not to use window scroll but instead handle scroll gesture (from mousewheel and touchmove) to control left and right panel, and prevent actual scroll when the panels are not fully opened.
so instead of $(window].scroll(handler), try with $('.cd-block').bind('mousewheel', handler) and $('.cd-block').bind('mousewheel', handler)
The handler being:
function updateCurrent(event) {

I want a button that shows or hides a div, but when I resize the browser and trigger a media query I want to disable the button, enabling it again when resizing to the previous media query. 
I'm using media queries with body:after {content:'tablet'; display:none;}, body:after {content:'laptop'; display:none;} and it works fine.
I'm using jQuery .on(); and .off(); to add/remove an event handler on window resize. The problem I'm having is that the event handler is getting added but it's toggling off straight away when I click it, going back to the 'tablet` viewport size.
How do I make it so that when I resize to the "laptop" size I remove the handler, but when I resize to "tablet" again I add the event handler.
jQuery 
function chooseMenu() {
    $('#sidebarWrapper').css('position', 'absolute').stop(true, true).toggle('showOrHide');
} // button function

if (size != currentSize) {

I am trying to make my code able to log any kind of errors on opening a database. What i am trying to do is , create a .txt file that all the logs will be saved in there in case of error.
What i ve done so far is :
bla bla bla
} catch(PDOException $e) {
        //in case of error , we create a log file with the error
        //$PDOException_file = 'PDOException_file_' . date('Y_m_d-H-i-s') . '.txt' ;
        $PDOException_file =  'PDOException_file' . '.txt' ;
        $fh = fopen($PDOException_file, 'w') or die();
        fwrite($fh, date('Y_m_d-H-i-s') . ' PDOException Error: ' . $e->getMessage() . "\n\n" );
        fclose($fh);
        echo 'Error: ' . $e->getMessage();

        }

What i expected from the code i wrote would be to create one .txt file "PDOException" file and inside get the logs like this :
2013_05_02-12-40-02 PDOException Error: bla bla bla

2013_05_02-12-43-02 PDOException Error: bla bla bla 

2013_05_02-13-45-02 PDOException Error: bla bla bla

That means every time i have an error , open the file , write the error make 2 new lines close the file. Then the next time i get an error , i write to the end of this file the error etc etc.
What happens though is that i rewrite in the beginning of my file on the old data. How can i avoid that?

A:

In your code where you have:
$fh = fopen($PDOException_file, 'w') or die()

You should use:
$fh = fopen($PDOException_file, 'a') or die()

The w open's the file for writing only and places the file pointer at the beginning of the file and truncate the file to zero length (deleting all contents). If the file does not exist,

Q:

Proving an Inequality (terms won't cancel out)

Problem: If $x$ and $y$ are real numbers such that $y \geq 0$ and $y(y+1) \leq (x+1)^2$, prove that $y(y-1) \leq x^2$.
This is what I tried:
\begin{align}
y(y+1) \leq (x+1)^2 &\implies y^2 + y \leq x^2 + 2x + 1 \\
                    &\implies x^2 \geq y^2 + y - 2x - 1 \\
                    &\implies x^2 \geq y^2 - y - 2x - 1 \tag{because $y \geq 0$}\\
                    &\implies x^2 \geq y(y-1) -2x - 1
\end{align}
I think I'm approaching this wrong, because if I start with the inequality $y(y+1) \leq (x+1)^2$, then the $2x + 1$ that results from the expansion of the RHS will never cancel out.
So, I tried this instead:
\begin{align}
y(y+1) \leq (x+1)^2 &\implies y^2 + y \leq x^2 + 2x + 1 \\
                    &\implies x^2 \geq y^2 + y - 2x - 1 \\
                    &\implies x^2 \geq y^2 - y - 2x - 1 \tag{same as before}
\end{align}
Then, I supposed that $y(y-1) \leq x^2$ is true. Consequently, because $y^2 - y - 2x - 1 \leq x^2$ (the last line), it is sufficient to show that $y(y-1) \leq y^2 - y - 2x - 1$. Again, this doesn't work because $-2x - 1$ doesn't cancel out.
Now I'm very much stuck and don't know how to proceed. If anyone can give me a hint, it'll be very much appreciated. Thanks!

I was playing around with arrays and I wanted to create a program in which you enter the value of money and then check how many coins or bank notes you need to fill that value.
In case you enter 650 you should get one for: 500 one for 100 and one for 50.
That's the program I got so far, but somehow it only prints out all of the values stored in bankovci array.
public static void main(String[] args) {

    int[]bills = {500,200,100,50,20,10,5,2,1};
    int amount=Integer.parseInt(JOptionPane.showInputDialog("Vnesi znesek: "));
    int sum=0;
    System.out.print("We will need bills for: ");
    while(sum<=amount)
    {
    for(int i=0; i < bills.length; i++)
    {
        if(amount-bills[i]>=0)
        {
            sum+=bills[i];

        }
        else if(amount-sum>bills[i])
        {
            i+=1;
        }System.out.print(bills[i]+", ");
    }

    }}}

Edit
In case I enter 650 or any other number I get the following output:

We will need bills for: 500, 200, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1,

There are cleaner ways of solving this problem (without using the break keyword), as I am sure other people will post.  But to help you understand where you had trouble, here is a modified version of the code that you supplied.  Notice that I changed the if statement, and removed the else block.  I also had to add a break to exit the for loop early, which is what I think you were trying to use the i+1 for.
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[]bills = {500,200,100,50,20,10,5,2,1};
    int amount=250;
    int sum=0;
    System.out.print("We will need bills for: ");
    while(sum<amount)
    {
        for(int i=0; i < bills.length;

I'm using the Bootstrap Toggle plugin to change my checkboxes into toggle switches. I'm also using AngularJS. When I set the checked value, it toggles fine. But when I don't, it does not toggle. You can see in the link to my results, that checkboxes are checked, but they are not toggling. Does anyone know why it's not binding using Angular?

Deatomizing a map

I have atoms in maps, which may or may not be a good idea, but the point is I needed to deref the atoms so I could json-str the maps, and json-str can't handle atoms, so I wrote this:
(defn deatomize- [m]
 (cond
   (instance? clojure.lang.Atom m) #(deatomize- @m)
   (map? m) (zipmap (keys m) (map #(trampoline deatomize- %) (vals m)))
   :else m
 )
)

(defn deatomize [m] (trampoline deatomize- m))

which seems to work, but a) is it good, b) is there a better way ?

A:

I think your code will work fine.
Some general feedback:

atoms in maps are a bit of an anti-pattern - usually you try to put maps in atoms. The idea is to keep your data structures immutable as much as possible, and have your references hold entire data structures at a fairly granular level. I'd strongly suggest rethinking this design - it will probably hurt you in the long run (for example, most Clojure library functions will assume immutable maps)
you are not deatomising the keys. maybe you never use atoms in keys in which case this is fine, but thought it was worth pointing out.
normally in Clojure closing parentheses don't get their own line and go at the end of the preceding line. this might feel odd at first, but it is good Lisp style that you should probably adopt.
performance of this function might not be that great because it is rebuilding the entire map structure piece by piece, even if nothing changes. reduce can be used to improve this, by only altering the map when you need to.
I think it is better to test for clojure.lang.IDeref rather than clojure.lang.Atom. By doing this, your code will also handle other reference types if needed.
trampoline is going to add overhead and is only needed in the (presumably rare?) case where you have really deep nesting in your data structure that is likely to cause stack overflows. If you need both safe stack handling and good performance then you might consider a recursive implementation and falling back to a trampoline version in

So I have a web app written in PHP that will run on different Ubuntu servers around the world.
Some of the servers will be configured to run on local time, some will run on UTC, it depends on the customer.
While I can edit the php.ini-file and set date.timezone, manually enter such data is bound to get wrong one day.
How can I get PHP to use the time zone already defined in the system (tzdata)?
Or, in other words: How can I extract (the long) time zone name from the system in PHP to use in date_default_timezone_set()?

A:

With the help that Andrey Knupp gave in his answer, I was able to solve this one.
echo "Time: " . date("Y-m-d H:i:s") . "<br>\n";

$shortName = exec('date +%Z');
echo "Short timezone:" . $shortName . "<br>";

$longName = timezone_name_from_abbr($shortName);
echo "Long timezone:" . $longName . "<br>";

date_default_timezone_set($longName);
echo "Time: " . date("Y-m-d H:i:s") . "<br>\n";

Gives output:
Time: 2011-12-23 23:29:45
Short timezone:MYT
Long timezone:Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
Time: 2011-12-24 06:29:45

Update: The short name for the time zones are not unique. For instance, in both America and Australia there is an "EST", leading     timezone_name_from_abbr  to sometimes pick the one I don't want to... You can ask date how big the offset is, and that can be used to further match the correct time zone:
$offset = exec('date +%::z');
$off = explode (":", $offset);
$offsetSeconds = $off[0][0] . abs($off[0])*3600 + $off[1]*60 + $off[2];
$longName = @timezone_name_from_abbr($shortName, $offsetSeconds);

Q:

FFMPEG: Extracting 20 images from a video of variable length

I've browsed the internet for this very intensively, but I didn't find what I needed, only variations of it which are not quite the thing I want to use.
I've got several videos in different lengths and I want to extract 20 images out of every video from start to the end, to show the broadest impression of the video.
So one video is 16m 47s long => 1007s in total => I have to make one snapshot of the video every 50 seconds.
So I figured using the -r switch of ffmpeg with the value of 0.019860973 (eq 20/1007) but ffmpeg tells me that the framerate is too small for it...
The only way I figured out to do it would be to write a script which calls ffmpeg with a manipulated -ss switch and using -vframes 1 but this is quite slow and a little bit off for me since ffmpegs numerates the images itself...
Any suggestions or directions?
Thanks,
Vapire

A:

I know I'm a bit late to the party, but I figured this might help:
For everyone having the issue where ffmpeg is generating an image for every single frame, here's how I solved it (using blahdiblah's answer):
First, I grabbed the total number of frames in the video:
ffprobe -show_streams <input_file> | grep "^nb_frames" | cut -d '=' -f 2

Then I tried using select to grab the frames:
ffmpeg -i <input_file> -vf "select='not(mod(n,100))'" <output_file>

But, no matter what the mod(n,100) was set to, ffmpeg was spitting out way too many frames. I had to add -vsync 0 to correct it, so my final command looked like this:
ffmpeg -i <input_file> -vsync 0 -vf "select='not(mod(n,100))'" <output_file>

(where 100 is the frame-frequency you'd like to use, for example, every 100th frame)
Hope that saves someone a little trouble!

LabWindows: implementing thread safe queues that can handle string
  elements
How to use a thread safe queue to store strings

I create a pointer to char in the main thread and allocate storage using malloc().  I copy some data into the storage, and assign the pointer to an array element (CmtWriteTSQData expects an array).  This array gets passed to a thread safe queue.
In a secondary thread, the thread safe queue is read.  The data is assigned to a new array.
How do I free the memory allocated within the secondary thread, as the pointer variable is no longer in scope?
Can I just call free() on the array element?  Or do I need to create another pointer to char in the secondary thread, copy the array element to it, and then call free() on the pointer?  
There doesn't appear to be a return value with free(), so I can't figure out how to ensure the call succeeds.
// Main thread
char *ptr = NULL;
char *array1[1] = {0};

ptr = (char *) malloc (3 * sizeof (char));

strcpy (ptr, "hi");

array1[0] = ptr;

CmtWriteTSQData (queue, array1, 1, 0 NULL);    

 
// Secondary thread
char *array2[1] = {0};

CmtReadTSQData (queue, array2, 1, 0, 0);

printf ("%s", array2[0]);  // Prints "hi"

free (array2[0]);  // Does this work?

A:

The short answer is yes.
When you call malloc(), you are asking the operating system to give you a chunk of usable memory of some minimum size, and the operating system responds by passing you a pointer, which is just an integer representing the virtual address of that chunk of memory.
When a program has multiple threads, this means that several lightweight processes are sharing the same virtual address space, which means if there are several copies of some valid pointer among several threads of the same process, then they must all point to the same memory location.
The operating system does not care which thread asked for the memory, and it does not care which thread gives it back. When malloc() returns a pointer in a process, all of the threads in that process may use it, and

Q:

How to create a versioning/history/revision system for contents published by users?

After reading a lot of SO questions about Keeping page changes history or How to version control a record in a database (for example), I can't find a real elegant solution to do the work.
Now, let's try  to explain as clear as possible what we need, for this simple revision system, that allows registered users to post some articles, and other users to submit a revision of those articles, and then some moderators users to check those revisions.
MySQL database
The database contains an articles table with the following simplified fields:
ARTICLE(id, id_user, title, content, date);

To implement the revision/history versions, I guess that we'll have the following table:
REVISION(id, id_article, revision_id_user, id_moderator, revision_date, 
         revision_title, revision_content, revision_description, revision_check);

With the relation : ARTICLE 0,n <---> 1,1 REVISION
Workflow

A user create an ARTICLE, which is inserted in the ARTICLE table (terrific !)

Another user makes an update of this ARTICLE, this update is recorded in the REVISION table, and is queued for the moderator users. (revision_check=0).

A moderator user validate the REVISION(revision_check=1), then the ARTICLE(content) gets the REVISION(revision_content) value.

My questions

Is this workflow seems to be a good way to do it? Because, I see a mistake: if there are several REVISIONs for an ARTICLE:

Should we take the content of the last submitted REVISION or the original ARTICLE?
Or, should we need to block the revisions as no other REVISION could be submitted while the last isn't checked.

Is there a way to record light versioning? By the way, is it possible to insert in the REVISION table, only the updated content through a SQL, PHP or js compare function? And how to display it like SO do it? Because I'm afraid that the REVISION table will be very heavy.

Bonus : how does SO?

standard way to make crispy sweet potato fries?

I've been looking for a way to fry (not bake) sweet potatoes, maybe like the double-fry method for russet and russet-like potatoes, to get a crispy exterior. 
Maybe I'm missing something but I'm having difficulty finding something for sweet potatoes (of any kind). I've consulted my cookbook library, and I haven't come across much. I've had mixed experiences with blog recipes, so I trust them less, but maybe this Munchies single-fry-from-frozen sweet potato fries article (which I will try this weekend) has some truth to it?:

Ingredients:

2 pounds large orange-fleshed sweet potatoes 
1 teaspoon baking soda 
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons cornstarch 
Peanut oil, for frying 
1 cup clubsoda or water Kosher or fine sea salt

Instructions:

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and make enough room in the freezer for said baking sheet.
Peel the sweet potatoes, if desired, and cut them lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick batons (fry shapes). Place them in a bowl with the
  baking soda and 2 tablespoons cornstarch, and toss. Arrange the sweet
  potatoes on the baking sheet in a single layer, making sure they are
  not touching. Freeze them until rock hard, at least 3 hours. If making
  fries later, transfer to a gallon-size zip-top freezer bag; they will
  keep frozen for up to 2 weeks.
Pour the oil into a large, heavy pot, preferably a Dutch oven, that's fitted with a deep-fry thermometer to a depth of 2 inches. Set
  the pot over medium heat and begin gently warming the oil to 375ºF.
In a large bowl, whisk together the remaining 1 cup cornstarch and the club soda. Stack several layers of brown paper on a baking sheet.
When the oil reaches 375ºF, drop a handful of sweet potatoes into the cornstarch mixture and coat evenly. Lift them from the bowl,
  letting any excess drip into the bowl, and carefully add them to the
  oil. Fry, stirring with a spider so they do not stick to the bottom of
  the pot, until deep golden brown and cooked through

In the realm of natural language, the "ideas a language can be used to express" are basically "any": all languages are capable of expressing any idea, so there's only one category of expressive type. Languages do differ in the way that they express a given idea. Assume a language Gwambomambo which lacks the word "recursion". That very word could be introduced into the language, just as "ballet" or "ghee" was introduced into English; or, a word might be invented using traditional roots of the language (e.g. "thing sits on itself"). Some languages have specific tenses for negative propositions and some use words like "not" to convey the idea; some languages have different forms of words to indicate that there is just one, or many, or maybe even just two, of the thing in question – other languages don't do this but do allow you to say "1 child", "many children", "more than 1 child" etc.
The greatest disparity between languages is lexical differences, that is the fact that we need a long expression to convey the notion "2 year old male reindeer", whereas languages spoken by reindeer-herding cultures usually have a single word for this.

In computer science, one essential property of all Turing-complete languages is that they are able to describe, "in their own way", how they themselves work.
For example, you can use a Turing machine to express how a Turing machine works.
Similarly, you can write, for example, a Prolog program that can interpret Prolog programs.
In the linguistic realm, it would seem to me that an analogon of "Turing completeness" is a language that can express concepts of the language itself.
For example, you can use English to describe English grammar, English words etc. Similarly, you can use Latin to describe Latin grammar. But you will in all likelihood not be able to use a language consisting of, say, 3 different whistled tones to describe how the tones themselves are constructed and related. This follows from the simple fact that the vocabulary and grammar are too restricted to talk about anything on the meta-level, or at least under reasonable assumptions (note that you can encode any information even with a single whistled tone, by reasoning about the time intervals between different occurrences of the tone). 
In computer science, a

I have been at this for quite a while now. Mainly following this tutorial. I have built the dependencies in the versions required by the instructions the 2 main parts beeing boost and caffe (which both entail a host of other dependecies).
I am running the entire thing on a fresh install of Ubuntu 19.10 (setup on a VM specifically for this project).
When i reach building of the armNN library (instructions part "Building the environment", step 4) it fails at linking libarmnn.so at ~45% with the following error output:
/usr/bin/ld: */path/to/boost*/boost_1_64_0/stage/lib/libboost_log.a(attribute_name.o): relocation R_X86_64_PC32 against symbol `_ZTVN5boost16exception_detail19error_info_injectorINS_3log12v2s_mt_posix16limitation_errorEEE' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC
/usr/bin/ld: final link failed: bad value

make[2]: *** [libarmnn.so.19.11] Error 1
make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/armnn.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2

I have built the entire boost library with cxx and c flags -fPIC. I checked specifically for the file in question (using ar -x libboost_log.a 
readelf --relocs attribute_name.o | egrep 'PLT' as suggest in the answer to this question)
Any suggestions on how to deal with this error or tips on what i should look into would be very much appreciated.

It took me a couple more attempts and another fresh VM but i finally managed to cross compile the armnn with caffe parsers support (X from ubuntu to android).
If you want to do the same there are a lot of dependencies which you have to compile yourself and you have to take care to compile them all with compatible versions. Which is when you are (like i was 3 weeks ago) just aquainted with all of these libraries in passing easier said then done.

Userform time format problems

Ok, so i have been working on a project for a while now. And its almost done. But i keep having small issues that i cant solve. This time its a formatting issue. 
Short and simple:
I have a table in sheet1(database) of information that i display in a userform (see image)  
There are several approaches to add a new line in the database, you can add it manually by filling all the empty text boxes, or you can double click an existing row and the text boxes fill them self. My problem is when i double clicking existing row, time format changes. see image. 
I solved that using this code:
Private Sub Reg5_Change()
Reg5.Value = Format(Reg5.Value, "hh:mm")
End Sub

But then i have trouble doing it the manually way. When i try to type in time i end up getting 00:00 and having trouble changing it.
Is there a way to solve this so i can use both methods for adding new row in database? 
Other questions:
I want the textbox ETA to contain ETD + EET. 
I tried this with a result of 08:02 when ETD = 08:00 and EET = 02:00. Seems like EET is added as minutes. 
Private Sub Reg7_AfterUpdate()
Reg7.Value = Reg5.Value + Reg6.Value
end sub

Update: 
Private Sub Reg7_Change()
Dim etd As String: etd = Reg5.Value
Dim eet As String: eet = Reg6.Value

Dim detd As date
Dim deet As date

detd = TimeSerial(Split(etd, ":")(0), Split(etd, ":")(1), 0)
deet = TimeSerial(Split(eet, ":")(0), Split(eet, ":")(1), 0)
Reg7.Value = detd + deet
end sub

Getting this error 
But as you can see in the image the time is correct and that part is working correct. 
hope there is someone out there who can help me out

class StaticTest{
    static{ System.out.println("static block 1"); }
    static SomeClass sc = new SomeClass();
    static{ System.out.println("static block 2"); }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new StaticTest();
    }
}

output
static block 1
creating SomeClass object
static block 2

Now since enum values are always placed at start of enum type, they will always be called before any static initialization block, because everything else can only be declared after enum values.
BUT initialization of enum values (which happens at class initialization) their constructors are called and as you said non-static initialization blocks are executed at start of every constructor which is why you see them:

for every enum value
and before any static initialization block.

A:

Little late and building up on Pshemo's answer. The output of the (compiling) code below is as follows:
8
10
Foo
static block 
Bar

So the enum constant initializations are executed first (as Pshemo said, they are always implicitly static and final, see second blockquote) and then all fields explicitly declared as static are initialized. As mentioned, the language specification says this about the order of execution during class initialization and about enum constants:

Next, execute either the class variable initializers and static initializers of the class, or the field initializers of the interface, in textual order, as though they were a single block.
In addition to the members that an enum type E inherits from Enum, for each declared enum constant with the name n, the enum type has an implicitly declared public static final field named n of type E. These fields are considered to be declared in the same order as the corresponding enum constants, before any static fields explicitly declared in the enum type.

class StaticTest {
    enum CoffeeSize {
        BIG(8), LARGE(10);
        private int ounces;

        static Foo foo = new Foo();
        static { System.out.println("static block "); }
        static Bar bar = new Bar();

        private CoffeeSize(int ounces){
            this.ounces = ounces;
            System.out.println(ounces);
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CoffeeSize cs = CoffeeSize

A:

Can a priest resign?
Simply desiring to add a few points of interest on this question, not mentioned in Dick Harfield's excellent answer.
The body of this question leaves me with a little confusion as to what is meant by the resignation of a priest!
First of all, according to the Code of Canon Law (Can. 332 §2) a pope may resign his office.

If it happens that the Roman Pontiff resigns his office, it is required for validity that the resignation is made freely and properly manifested but not that it is accepted by anyone.

When a pope resigns his office as Supreme Pontiff of the Church, he no longer remains pope, but by virtue of his consecration as a bishop, remains a bishop forever.
Secondly bishops must resign their posts at the age of 75. However the pope may or may not accept the resignation in question.

Can. 401 §1 A diocesan Bishop who has completed his seventy-fifth year of age is requested to offer his resignation from office to the Supreme Pontiff, who, taking all the circumstances into account, will make provision accordingly. 
§2 A diocesan Bishop who, because of illness or some other grave reason, has become unsuited for the fulfillment of his office, is earnestly requested to offer his resignation from office. 
Can. 402 §1 A Bishop whose resignation from office has been accepted, acquires the title 'emeritus' of his diocese. If he so wishes, he may have a residence in the diocese unless, because of special circumstances in certain cases, the Apostolic See provides otherwise. 

As for priests most dioceses have rules set up for the resignation for diocesan priests. here is an example taken from the Diocese of San Diego.

The Code of Canon Law (Canon 538 §3) sets the age for retirement of pastors at seventyfive
  (75). When a pastor reaches seventy-five (75) years of age he is asked to submit his
  resignation to the bishop who, after considering all the circumstances of person and place,
  will decide whether to accept or defer the resignation.
All priests who are able to do so are expected to continue in a diocesan assignment until age
  seventy-five (75).
For good reason and with permission of the bishop, a priest may retire earlier.

}

If i inspect the object, it will have a value for it.ceo.name but the rest will be null inside it.ceo. Also will be the it.ceo.person = null. In the DB there are all values for the attributes.
EDIT: If there are no invalid fields inside the excel file, there are no ValidationException. Everything will be imported fine.
EDIT 2: Added the for-loop inside the importExcel() method.

A:

The problem was, that inside the Zoo.withTransaction closure was a for-loop which looped through all the rows inside the excel file. For the solution, we moved the .withTransaction inside the for-loop and the problem was gone. 
Code in ImportService looks now like this: 
  importExcel(){

   String errorMsg="";
   //some operations
   for(int rowNum = excelFile

    return {
        restrict: 'A',
        link: function(scope, element, attrs) {
            var expr = objectParser(attrs.pointer);
            element.mousemove(function(e) {
                var offest = element.offset();
                scope.$apply(function() {
                    expr.assign(scope, {
                        x: e.pageX - offest.left,
                        y: e.pageY - offest.top
                    });
                });
            });
        }
    };

});

Isolate scope
The problem is that ng-show uses the scope of the element it's on. If it's on an element that has a directive with isolate scope, then it will use that isolate scope, and not have access to the outside scope.
In this particular case, I suspect that description-popup has isolate scope, which means ng-show only has access to the scope of that directive, which probably doesn't have the item that you're trying to test against.
What is isolate scope?
Isolate scope means the directive has its own scope that does not inherit from the surrounding scope. Normal scopes inherit from the surrounding scopes, so they have access to the data on that surrounding scope. Isolate scope does not.
Why would anyone ever want to use isolate scope?!
Reuse. If a directive is intended to be reused in lots of places, in lots of different scopes with a variety of properties on them, you don't want properties on the directive's scope to collide with the properties of the surrounding scope. And since the directive is supposed to be totally independent and not use the surrounding scope at all, it's often a good idea to give it an isolate scope. There are very few disadvantages to this. Really, the only thing that's likely to go wrong is when someone wants to put an ng-show or ng-hide on that element.
Solution
Put your ng-show on an extra <div> around the description-popup:
<div ng-show="!!item.description && item.show_description">
    <div class="description-popup"
         style="left: {{item.x}}px; top: {{item.y}}px">
        <h2>{{item.label}}</h2>
        <p>{{item.description}}</p>
        <p>{{

I am trying to implement the function that compares two files. The function should restore the first lines that differ from each other. If the files are the same, NULL will be returned. The function ends as soon as either of the files ends, and then NULL is returned. I think my if functions doesn't work and so on this function don't return the lines.
Here is my code:
char *difference(const char* file1, const char* file2)
{
    char line1[1000];
    char line2[1000];
    char *a = malloc(1000 * sizeof(char));

    FILE *f1 = fopen(file1, "r");
    FILE *f2 = fopen(file2, "r");
    if (!f1 || !f2) // checking if there is any error 
    {
        return -1; 
    }

    while (fgets(line1, sizeof(line1), file1) != NULL && fgets(line2, sizeof(line2), file1) != NULL)
{
    if (strcmp(line1, line2) != 0)
    {
        strcpy(a, line1);
        strcpy(a, line2);

    }
    else
    {
        return NULL;
    }
}

fclose(f1);
fclose(f2);
return a;

int main(void)

    char* diff = difference("testifile.c", "testifile2.c");
    printf("\n--- Difference:\n");
    printf("%s", diff);

    free(diff);

    return 0;
}

A:

Yeah that doesn't work so good. Here are the bugs:
return -1;

Does not compile. Did you mean
return (char*)-1;

Also, leaks memory. Do:
 if (f1) fclose(f1);
 if (f2) fclose(f2);
 return (char*)-1;

Oops you read from file1 twice:
while (fgets(line1, sizeof(line1), file1) != NULL && fgets(line2, sizeof(line2), file1) != NULL)

should be
while (fgets(line1,

group-by :key on a vector of maps
select-keys on remaining maps without the previous key
group-by again (0..n times) and select-keys
count unique key instances at the end.

See also my previous question: Aggregate and Count in Maps
Example:
Given a vector of maps
(def DATA [{:a "X", :b "M", :c "K", :d 10}
           {:a "Y", :b "M", :c "K", :d 20}
           {:a "Y", :b "M", :c "F", :d 30}
           {:a "Y", :b "P", :c "G", :d 40}])

performing group-by
(defn get-tree-level-1 [] (group-by :a DATA))

yields a map grouped by the value of that particular key.
{ X [{:a X, :b M, :c K, :d 10}],
  Y [{:a Y, :b M, :c K, :d 20}
     {:a Y, :b M, :c F, :d 30}
     {:a Y, :b P, :c G, :d 40}]}  

So far, so good. But what if I want to build a tree-like structure out of the data, which means selecting the remaining keys and ignoring some, select :b and :c and ignore :d, which would yield in the next level:
(def DATA2   [{ :X [{:b "M", :c "K"}],
                :Y [{:b "M", :c "K"}
                    {:b "M", :c "F"}
                    {:b "P", :c "G"}]}])

And finally, counting all instances of the remaining keys (e.g. count all unique values of the :b key under the Y-root):
(def DATA3   [{ :X [{:M  1}],
                :Y [{:M  2}
                    {:P  1}])

I tried doing a select-keys after the group-by, but the result was empty after the first step:
(defn get-proc-sums []
  (into {}
    (

Q:

$A(c) \to \forall x A(x) $ not valid even though $A(c)$ can be used to prove $\forall x A(x)$

I would like some advice on a few sentences, although I realize they might be too far removed from their context. This is the statement, from page 11 in Paul Cohen’s book “Set theory and  the continuum Hypothesis”: 
"Assume we know that $A(c)$ is a valid statement. We shall show that $\forall x A(x)$ is a valid statement (This is not the same as saying $A(c) \to \forall x A(x) $ is valid which it is not in general)."
Intuitively I make the mistake he is talking about. What is the explanation?
Let me add that I also appreciate some advice on books in set theory with more examples and extensive comments. I saw that the book was highly recommended, but it is mainly a facsimile of a typewritten historical text, very compact.

A:

What is going on here is that there is some language $L$ which has, among other thing, a constant symbol $c$.  $A(x)$ is a formula with a single free variable $x$ over this language $L$ and $A(c)$ is the same formula with the constant symbol $c$ substituted for $x$.
Now "$A(c)$ is valid" means that for every structure ${\mathfrak A}$ for the language $L$, the interpretation of $A(c)$ in ${\mathfrak A}$ is true, i.e., ${\mathfrak A} \models A(c)$. Note that such a structure ${\mathfrak A}$ includes an interpretation for the constant $c$.
Now look at the language $K$ which is exactly the same as $L$ except it does not have the constant symbol $c$. 
In a structure ${\mathfrak B}$ for $K$, you cannot interpret $A(c)$, but you can interpret $A(x)$ if you're also given a valuation $\eta$ of all free variables of $A(x)$ (i.e., of just $x$) in ${\mathfrak B}$. It is customary to say that $A(x)$ is true in ${\mathfrak B}$ (i.e., $\mathfrak B \models A(x)$) if it is true for every valuation of (i.e., for every

Scala abstract type bounds cross referencing

I have two abstract classes which will hold references to each other.How / can I type bound the type members so as the types of HexT in the SideT members of the derived Hex classes will always be the derived Hex class? so for a derived class HexA it is guaranteed that: HexA#SideT#HexT = HexA
And similarly that the types of SideT in the HexT members of all the  derived Side classes will be the derived Side Class: SideB#HexT#SideT = SideB
I'm using Scala for Eclipse 2.1.0.M1 with Eclipse 3.7.2 All Classes are in separate files. The following compiles OK but doesn't guarantee what I want: 
abstract class Hex { type SideT <: Side {type HexT <= Hex } }
abstract class Side { type HexT <: Hex {type SideT <= side } }
class HexC() extends Hex() { type SideT = SideC }
class SideC extends Side { type HexT = HexC }

But the following won't compile in the derived implementations:
abstract class Hex{type SideT <: Side {type HexT = this.type}}
abstract class Side{type HexT <: Hex {type SideT = this.type}}
class HexC() extends Hex(){
  type SideT = SideC //This won't compile
}
class SideC extends Side {
  type HexT = HexC //this won't compile
}

Is this correct? Should this compile?

A:

How about this?
abstract class Hex {
  type SideT <: Side
}

abstract class Side {
  type HexT <: Hex
}

class HexC extends Hex {
  type SideT = SideC
}

class SideC extends Side {
  type HexT = HexC
}

val evidence1 = implicitly[SideC#HexT =:= HexC]
val evidence2 = implicitly[SideC#HexT#SideT =:= SideC]

Or with an encapsulating trait for the domain:
trait abstractDomain {
  type SideT <: Side
  type HexT <: Hex

  abstract class Hex
  abstract class Side
}

object domain extends abstractDomain {
  type SideT

How can I fix a key broken off in a door lock?

This morning I tried to open the passenger-side door (of my 2001 VW Eurovan) but it appears to be stuck.  The door is unlocked.  I can pull the handle, but apparently not far enough to operate the door mechanism.  Same for both interior and exterior door handles.  The other doors appear to be OK.
Lock/unlock with the remote keyfob appears OK.
I tried lock/unlock with the actual physical key, but it seems that I can only push the key about 2/3rds of the way in.
So it appears that some numskull joker tried to jimmy my door yesterday evening, failed, but left something (part of a key, perhaps) in the lock.
Any tips/advice for removing whatever object is stuck in the lock myself?
Or is this something I'll need a mechanic or a locksmith to fix?

Update:
I thought the door was not openable at all, but I fiddled with it a bit more and it turns out I can open it with the interior door handle.  I'll take the door cover off later to see what I can find - I know how to do this from when I fixed the powerwindows :)

A:

You need to find a way to open the door, slim jim or other tool.
Once the door is open you need to remove the lock cylinder to get the broken key out. Depending on the vehicle how hard or easy this is.
The cylinder may have been damaged and would need replaced and re-pinned to your key, this would require a locksmith.
If you can remove the lock cylinder yourself this will save money when you take it to a locksmith shop for repair or replacement.
Fastest way to repair this is to call a locksmith.

A:

Don't know if this would be the best way to attack the problem, but here's what I would do.
Remove the interior door handle and fiddle with the linkage trying to get the door to open.
If that does not work, remove that passenger's seat so you have room to work.  Remove the door cover.  Hopefully this can be done with the door closed.  Even if you can't get it all the way off, hopefully you can remove it enough to get your hand in there and move the linkage manually.

Given $x^2 + 4x + 6$ as factor of $x^4 + ax^2 + b$, then $a + b$ is

I got this task two days ago, quite difficult for me, since I have not done applications of Vieta's formulas and Bezout's Theorem for a while. If can someone solve this and add exactly how I am supposed to use these two theorem's on this task, I would be thankful.

Given $x^2 + 4x + 6$ as factor of $x^4 + ax^2 + b$, then $a + b$ is equal to?

A:

Since $x^4 + a x^2 + b$ is even (i.e. invariant under $x \to -x$), so is its factorization.  If $x^2 + 4 x + 6$ is one factor, the other must be .... 

A:

There is some quadratic $x^2 + cx + d$ such that:
$$(x^2 + 4x + 6)(x^2 + cx + d) = x^4 + ax^2 + b$$
Multiply it out:
$$x^4 + (c + 4)x^3 + (d + 4c + 6)x^2 + (6c + 4d)x + 6d = x^4 + ax^2 + b$$
Equate coefficients:
$$\begin{cases}
c + 4 = 0 \\
d + 4c + 6 = a \\
4d + 6c = 0 \\
6d = b
\end{cases}$$
Use the first equation to find $c$.  Use the third to find $d$.  Use those to find $a$ and $b$.

A:

Let $r_1,r_2$ be the roots of $x^2+4x+6$. By Vieta's $r_1+r_2 = -4$ and $r_1r_2 = 6$.
Since $x^2+4x+6$ is a factor of $x^4+ax^2+b$, we have that $r_1,r_2$ are also roots of $x^4+ax^2+b$. 
Then, since $x^4+ax^2+b$ is an even polynomial, $-

Determine the acceleration in a double Atwood machine

Trying to solve the following double Atwood machine:  

Suppose there is a mass of 12kg hanging on an ideal rope that wraps around an ideal pulley, and that the other end of the rope is attached to another ideal pulley's axis.  This second pulley has a rope around it which on one side holds a mass of 4kg and on the other a mass of 8kg.  What is the acceleration of the first mass?

So here's what I've done so far:  First I've determined that the tension in the first rope is twice the tension in the rope for the "subsystem", and that the acceleration of the first mass is the average of the accelerations of the two other masses but in the opposite direction.  That is to say
$$T' = T/2$$
$$a_{1}=-\frac{a_{2}+a_{3}}{2}$$
From free-body diagrams we can determine that 
$$-12a = T-12g$$
$$4a_{2} = T/2 - 4g$$
$$-8a_{3} = T/2 - 8g$$
However, when I solve this system I obtain $T=32a$ which seems impossible that the tension would be greater than the greatest force of gravity of any mass.
Part of me wonders if this has anything to do with it:  How do I know which direction the third mass is traveling?  The first mass is causing the subsystem to accelerate upwards but the third mass is accelerating downwards relative to the subsystem.  So how do I know the direction of acceleration relative to the ground?

A:

Let
\begin{align}
  m_1 = 12\,\mathrm{kg}, \qquad m_2 = 4\,\mathrm{kg}, \qquad m_3 = 8\,\mathrm{kg}
\end{align}
If you solve this problem symbolically, then you'll find that the tension $T$ applied to mass $m_1$ satisfies
\begin{align}
  T = \left(\frac{8m_1m_2m_3}{m_1m_2+m_1m_3+4m_2m_3}\right)g.
\end{align}
If you plug in the values given for the various masses, then you obtain

For each positive integer $n$, let
$$S_n= \frac1{n(n+1)} + \frac1{(n+1)(n+2)} +\dots + \frac1{(2n−1)2n}.$$
(a) Calculate
$S_1,S_2,S_3$. Then use this data to guess a simple formula for
$S_n$.
(b) Prove your guess in part (a) by mathematical induction.
(c) Use Result 6.6 on page 136 to give another proof of your guess.
(d) Prove that
$$\frac1{k(k+1)}=\frac1k−\frac1{k+1}$$
for all positive real numbers $k$. Use this to give yet another proof of your guess in part (a). This method of proof is called telescoping.
Result 6.6: For every positive integer $n$:
$$\frac1{(2)(3)} + \frac1{(3)(4)} +\dots + \frac1{(n+1)(n+2)} = \frac{n}{2n+4}.$$
-
I've already given a proof of 2(b) for that $S_{n} = \frac1{2n}$, but I am stuck on (c) and (d).

A:

HINT for (c): No matter what the terms $a_k$ are, $$a_{n+1}+a_{n+2}+\dots+a_{2n} = (a_3+a_4+\dots+a_{2n})-(a_3+a_4+\dots+a_n)\::$$ just look at what cancels out.
For (d), verifying that $$\frac1{k(k+1)}=\frac1k-\frac1{k+1}$$ is just algebra. Once you have that, $$\begin{align*}
S_n &= \frac1{n(n+1)} + \frac1{(n+1)(n+2)} +\dots + \frac1{(2n−1)2n}\\
&= \left(\frac1n-\frac1{n+1}\right)+\left(\frac1{n+1}-\frac1{n+2}\right)+\dots+\left(\frac1{2n-1}-\frac1{2n}\

Q:

Keeping console text with RedirectStandardOutput

I'm creating a windows forms application and I'm trying to get the output from a console application whilst keeping the output printed out on the application aswell.
I tried creating a Process, setting RedirectStandardOutput to true and ExecuteShell to false, then I started an async read operation which worked perfectly, the problem is that my applcation "steals" the output from the application so the output isn't shown in the application anymore.
Is there any way to capture the output whilst keeping the output on the console application? I was thinking of perhaps capturing the output and then sending all of the ouput back to the outputstream of the application, but I have no idea how to accomplish this.
Thanks in advance,
Jamey

A:

Native methods AllocConsole and FreeConsole can be used to create and destroy a console for any running process and child console processes will use their parent's console by default (they won't create additional floating console windows that aren't useful), so you can attach a console to your own process, start the child process, and then write the output to your newly allocated console to do what you're trying to accomplish. If you also need the user to be able to provide input to the console application, the solution will be somewhat hairier, but it should still be possible to put something together that starts a separate thread with the job of passing console input through to the child process. One other nice detail about this implementation is that you can keep the console and its output around past the exit of the child process if you want to.
The form below has two buttons, but to keep the example code compact I don't include the buttons themselves, just their click events.
public partial class RunForm : Form
{
    public RunForm()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
    }

    private void runButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        NativeMethods.AllocConsole();

        using (Process process = new Process())
        {
            process.StartInfo.FileName = "cmd.exe";
            process.StartInfo.Arguments = "/c echo Hello world!";
            process.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false;
            process.StartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput = true;

            process.Start();
            process.OutputDataReceived += process_OutputDataReceived;


//The no. of business days is: (number of weeks between the two dates) * (5 working days) + the remainder
//---->february in none leap years gave a remainder of 0 but still calculated weekends between first and last day, this is one way to fix it
$workingDays = $no_full_weeks * 5;
if ($no_remaining_days > 0 )
{
  $workingDays += $no_remaining_days;
}

//We subtract the holidays
foreach($holidays as $holiday){
    $time_stamp=strtotime($holiday);
    //If the holiday doesn't fall in weekend
    if ($startDate <= $time_stamp && $time_stamp <= $endDate && date("N",$time_stamp) != 6 && date("N",$time_stamp) != 7)
        $workingDays--;
}

return $workingDays;
}

//Example:

$holidays=array("2008-12-25","2008-12-26","2009-01-01");

echo getWorkingDays("$startdate","$enddate",$holidays)
?>

Now I'd like to extend this function a bit. I would like to generate what date it will be if I add X working days from the starting date. Say for example i have a variable that holds the value 20
$workingdays = "20";

And the $startdate is 2012-06-01 i would like to make this function calculate that the startdate + 20 working days will be 2012-06-28. Would this be possible?

A:

I did a similar thing a while back using the below function. the key here is skipping the weekends, you can extend this to skip holidays as well.
Example:
Call the function - > addDays(strtotime($startDate), 20, $skipdays,$skipdates = array())
 <?php
    function addDays($timestamp, $days, $skipdays = array("Saturday", "Sunday"), $skipdates = NULL) {
        // $skipdays: array (Monday-Sunday) eg. array("Saturday","Sunday")
        // $skipdates: array (YYYY-mm-dd) eg. array("2012-05-02","2015-08

My objective is to get all the documents in each 'School' group with the latest  "Date" in each 'School' Group, not the latest "Date' of the whole DB.
Expected Result:
{ "School": "A",
  "Class": "A",
  "Student": "XXX",
  "Date": ISODate("2018-01-31T00:00:00.000Z")
},
{ "School": "A",
  "Class": "C",
  "Student": "ZZZ",
  "Date": ISODate("2018-01-31T00:00:00.000Z")
},
{ "School": "B",
  "Class": "C",
  "Student": "GHI",
  "Date": ISODate("2019-02-03T00:00:00.000Z")
}

I have tried using
db.myDB.aggregate([
  { "$sort": {
               "School":1, 
               "Date":1
             }
  },
  { "$group": {"_id": {School:"$School"},
                    "fullDocument": {
                         $push: 
                           {School: "$School", Class: "$Class", Date: $Date"}
                    }, 
                    "LatestDate": {"$max": "$Date"}
              }
  }
])

What I get in 'fullDocument' still includes all documents not with the latest 'Date'

A:

First, you need to group on the basis of School and get the entire document for a particular school in an array by using $ROOT
Then you just need to get the documents having Date as the max date in that array using filter
db.collection.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$School",
      data: {
        "$push": "$$ROOT"
      }
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
      data: {
        $filter: {
          input: "$data",
          as: "item",
          cond: {
            $eq: [
              "$$item.Date",
              {
                $max: "$data.Date"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }

In Tomb of Annihilation you have the mechanic in the game where you have to drink more water than normal. Since you can't really rely on the rain catcher all the time would a good subsitute be the Ranger/Druid spell Goodberry?
With Goodberry, one “berry provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day.” Would this be enough or would player characters still need more since there is a higher need for resources?

A:

RAI, Goodberry isn't meant to provide water
Jeremy Crawford tweeted the intent behind the Goodberry spell - the "nourishment" provided by it still doesn't save you from thirst:

The nourishment provided by goodberry is meant to be like food, not water

So even if you eat goodberries, you still need water in Chult.
However, a GM has the last word
In the same tweet JC adds, that

a DM can say otherwise

So there are possible situations, where DM should make such a ruling. In Chult PCs need to drink a lot of water to survive, I'd say you shouldn't allow your party to completely neglect this part and just use Goodberry (by using all remaining spell slots before a long rest, for instance). But this depends on the DMing style and is opinion-based.

A:

Probably
Goodberry says "... the berry provides enough nourishment to
sustain a creature for one day."
Nourishment is not a game term so it takes its normal English meaning. The OED defines nourishment as "The food necessary for growth, health, and good condition" and food as "Any nutritious substance that people or animals eat or drink or that plants absorb in order to maintain life and growth." Water is a "nutritious substance that people or animals eat or drink ... in order to maintain life and growth."
In summary, a Goodbery gives you what you need to stay alive for 1 day. Whatever that is. 
As an analogy, in a cold climate you need more kJ per day than in a hot climate to maintain body heat - those kJ are "nutrition" - does this work or is Goodberry only good in temperate climates?
As a game mechanism, Goodberry is serving exactly the same role as the rain catcher - it is draining party resources. For the former that comes in the form of a 1st

how set time for leave page event

i saw a nice mobile app design and really curious how i can run this effect in reality. let me explain with picture...
take look please
so, when page is loading, they close. and when we want to leave and visit the next page, first, they'll hide and then they'll shows again and like this...

Edited!
The question is, how can i set time for leave event, i could show the loading style but when i want to visit the next page, it will be very fast, or if i understood right, the effect doesn't shows..  

my Main.js
$(document).ready(function () {
    $("div.top").addClass(" show");
    $("div.bottom").addClass(" show");
}); 

$(window).bind('beforeunload', function () {

        $("div.bottom").removeClass(" show");
        $("div.top").addClass(" fade");

Thanks

A:

All you have to do is change <Custom Action="RestoreConfigFile" After="InstallInitialize" /> to <Custom Action="RestoreConfigFile" After="RemoveExistingProducts " />
It is simply a timing issue that you are having. You are telling all three actions to take place after InstallInitialize so it is very possible that they are not staying in the order that they are written. It is always a better idea to explicitly list which order you want them in. A better, complete fix, would be:
<Custom Action="BackupConfigFile" After="InstallInitialize" />

the idea was to mimic filmmaking technology available at the dawn of time.  I want to introduce the idea to my son but can't remember where I found it or the name of it.

A:

Generally "Minimalism" is more about shedding content to focus on the essence, "eliminating all non-essential forms, features or concepts." This does not necessarily require the elimination of sound or strict use of b/w.
Another term used for a Minimalist like film back in the 1970s was "lean".
What you are describing is more like emulating a silent film which reached its peak in 1928.
If you only use b/w, 60 seconds, no camera movement (pans, tilts, tracking), no cuts, no edits what you have is one clip from a stationary camera. This in itself does not fulfill what "Minimalism" in cinema is about as the balance of this question rests with whether the content is in fact Minimalism.
Also, specifying certain aspects such as b/w and no sound are somewhat superficial now.
Consider that before 1928 that sound was generally limited to what music or sound effects could be played live with the film. So too, color films were not widely available so only hand tinted films existed. Before 1928 the cinematographer generally did not have the option of synchronized sound and color. To go back to this approach is a conscience artistic choice today where as back then, you did not have this choice cause that's all you had.
I would call the genre you are describing as approaching Neo-Silent but not quite there as these guys use hand-cranked gear etc, as described in their manifesto:
http://www.silentmovies.com/neosilent/neosilent.htm
So perhaps, "Post-Neo-Silent" is a more accurate term?
In any event what you are describing is actually very popular in some cinema circles. Consider director, Blake Whitman's "1 Minute Vimeo Project":

There are 4 values possible for conf from 0 to 3.
My problem is : some subjects do not have any values for conf=3 in certain conditions, which results in a wrong mean.
Is it possible to force data.table to create a row
subject conf state memtype Lconf   conf_tx
  LT005    3    OM      WM     0 0.0000000

even if there is no value ? Something like ,by=list(conf=c(0,1,2,3),state,memtype)
Precisions : I calculate the rate of each confidence response (0, 1, 2, 3) for each subject, so my ratio is the number of each response over the sum of all responses. When a subject never answered "3", I want a row where data.table still calculates length(conf==3)=0.

Q:

Why isn't tension equal throughout?

Before rotation is introduced into the course, Atwood machines were considered to have equal tension throughout. In this particular problem however, the pulley did have a significant body which rotated about an axis. In captions the authors stated that the tensions may not be equal even though it is on the same rope, an indeed the tensions are different numerically.
Why can we assume equal tensions when the pulley is negligible but not when it is significant?

A:

It is all a matter of progression.  
When one starts studying Mechanics it is in terms of point masses, massless and inextensible strings, frictionless and massless pulleys, etc..
This is done to produce some foundations on which to build.
Strings and pulleys are just devices for transferring forces from one place to another and changing the directions of forces.
A step forward is to introduce rotational dynamics where bodies are no longer treated as point masses and pulleys suddenly become nearer to those that can be found in the real world.  
It appears that you have taken such a step.
If you have a pulley of moment of inertia $I_{\rm C}$ about its centre of mass then to produce an angular acceleration $\alpha$ of the pulley requires a torque about the centre of mass of the pulley of $\tau = I_{\rm C} \;\alpha$.
Note that if the pulley is massless then it has no moment of inertia and so requires no torque to accelerate it.  
The torque is applied using a string which can still be assumed massless and inextensible but now communicates with the pulley via a static frictional force.  
This now means that the tension in the string is no longer constant as is shown in the solution to the capstan problem.  (However note that there are no accelerations in the derivation).  
You normally do not worry about the detail of the interaction between the pulley and the string what interests you is the fact that the tensions at either end of the string are difference and it is that difference which enable the string to apply a torque on the pulley.  
In some cases you could assume that the moment of inertia of the pulley is so small as to make the very little difference to the tension in the string which is mirroring the assumption that the pulley is massless.
I wonder what assumptions (simplifications) NASA made when designing their pulley system?

i'm really noob in C. I just need to compile a ANSI C source to get a dll.
During compilation i get this error:

Where SelectML is a public function with this definition:

Q:

"Raw value for enum case is not unique" for Swift enum with Float raw values

According to The Swift Programming Language, I should be able to create a Swift enum with raw values of "strings, characters, or any of the integer or floating-point number types". But when I try:
enum BatteryVoltage: Float {
    case v3v7 = 3.7
    case v5v0 = 5.0
    case v7v4 = 7.4
    case v11v1 = 11.1
    case v12v0 = 12.0
}

... I get a compilation error:
Raw value for enum case is not unique

on the v7v4 line. It compiles fine with that one commented out. But ah, it looks unique to me. If I make the value 7.41, or 7.3 or something else it compiles fine. What's going on? Swift bug?

A:

It definitely says you can, but don't use floating-point values (and especially Float) where you're going to need to compare equality -- the precision just isn't guaranteed to be good enough. And always use Double unless you absolutely need to use a Float for compatibility reasons.
In this case, it seems like it's having trouble because (a) the third case is 2x the first case, and (b) some other factor I don't know. Using 3.3/6.6, 3.4/6.8, and 3.6/7.2 also gave me the issue, but 3.5/7.0 did not. However, I could get it to show up by changing the last case to 22.2 (2x 11.1).
Here's a workaround — use a typical Int-based enumeration, and provide a doubleValue property:
enum BatteryVoltage: Int {
    case v3v7
    case v5v0
    case v7v4
    case v11v1
    case v12v0

    var doubleValue: Double {
        switch self {
        case .v3v7: return 3.7
        case .v5v0: return 5.0
        case .v7v4: return 7.4
        case .v11v1: return 11.1
        case .v12v0

Now, as I understand it, [NSObject new] is practically (if not exactly?) the same as [[NSObject alloc] init]. So we can basically merge those two options as far as I'm concerned. Regarding the [NSDictionary dictionary] method though, the documentation says:

dictionary
Creates and returns an empty dictionary.
+ (id)dictionary
Return Value
A new empty dictionary.
Discussion
This method is declared primarily for use with mutable subclasses of
  NSDictionary.
If you don’t want a temporary object, you can also create an empty
  dictionary using alloc... and init.

I have a couple of questions regarding this documentation to begin with:
Firstly, why is it even declared in NSDictionary instead of NSMutableDictionary if that is where it is intended to be used?
Secondly, what do they mean by "temporary object" in this context?
In summary: Is there a difference between the third alternative above, compared to the first two? Could it have something to do with autoreleasing objects? Does that even matter in an Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) context?
Note that this question applies to other classes as well, for example [NSData data] and [NSArray array].
I am using XCode 4.6.1 and iOS 6.1. Does it matter which one I use these days, using ARC? Perhaps from some perspective on performance?
Thank you for any clear information on this!

A:

Firstly, why is it even declared in NSDictionary instead of NSMutableDictionary if that is where it is intended to be used?

Because it can still be useful to get an empty NSDictionary object. It's expected to be mostly used with NSMutableDictionary, but that doesn't mean it can't ever be used with NSDictionary.

Secondly, what do they mean by "temporary object" in this context?

Seems like bad documentation. They probably meant to say that if you don't want it to enter the autorelease pool then you can use alloc/init.

If you're using ARC, then whichever of these 3 methods you pick is entirely personal preference, as they'll all behave the same.
If you're not using ARC, then you should use +dictionary any time you need an autoreleased dictionary, and +alloc/init any time you need

Let $X$ be a compact Riemann surface of genus $g \geq 0$. Let $\gamma \in H_1(X , \mathbb{Z})$ and $\omega_1,...,\omega_g$ a basis for the space of holomorphic forms. The next result is in general true?
$$ \int_{\gamma} \omega_i = 0 \text{ for all } i \in \{1,...,g \} \text{ if and only if } \gamma = 0 \text{ in homology.} $$
It's trivially that the $\textbf{If}$ part is true, but the converse?
My attempt: If $c_1,...,c_{2g}$ are a basis for $H_1(X, \mathbb{Z})$, then $\gamma = m_1 c_1 + ... + m_{2g}c_g$ for some $m_i \in \mathbb{Z}$. Now
$$\int_{\gamma} \omega_i = m_1\int_{c_1} \omega_i + ... + m_{2g} \int_{c_{2g}} \omega_i = 0 \quad \forall i$$
and we consider by taking conjugates
$$\int_{\gamma} \overline{\omega_i} = m_1\int_{c_1} \overline{\omega_i} + ... + m_{2g} \int_{c_{2g}} \overline{\omega_i} = 0 \quad \forall i$$ 
then the matrix
$$P_{2g\times 2g} = \left(\int_{c_j} \omega_1 ,...,\int_{c_j} \omega_{g},\int_{c_j} \overline{\omega_1} ,...,\int_{c_j} \overline{\omega_{g}}  \right)_{1 \leq j\leq 2g} $$ 
has no null kernel. By Riemann's relations $P$ is non singular, this implies $m_1 = ... =m_{2g} = 0$ and $\gamma = 0$.

A:

Note that there is a well defined Hodge  star $\star$ on $X$ (locally given by $\star d z = - i d z, \star d \bar z = i d \bar z)$, consider:

Harmonic $1$-forms: $\mathscr{H

  setState(state: string) {
    this.sourceState.next(state);
    console.log(this.currentState);
    }
}

My components all subscribe to this observable during the NgOnInit lifecycle.
Nav.component.ts
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { AuthService } from '../../services/auth.service';
import { StateService } from '../../services/state.service';
import { Router } from '@angular/router';
import 'rxjs/add/operator/filter';
import { Location } from '@angular/common';

@Component ({
  selector: 'app-nav',
  templateUrl: './nav.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./nav.component.scss'],
  providers: [StateService]
})
export class NavComponent implements OnInit {
  currentState: string;

  constructor(
    private authService: AuthService,
    private router: Router,
    private stateService: StateService
  ) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.stateService.currentState.subscribe(
      state => (this.currentState = state)
    );
  }

  logout() {
    this.authService.logout();
  }
  
  changeState(state: string) {
    this.stateService.setState(state);
  }
}

Other components in my application will call the setState function in the state.service.ts file. I am binding the state value in my template just to watch the value so I can then use directives to change the experience based on application state.
The Problem
Values in the components are not changing even though when I console.log the observable I can see it is being set correctly.
Note
When I call the setState function within the nav component I do see the value of the string interpolation change but only in the nav.component.ts, other components will not change. It is almost like they are using clones of the observable.

A:

I used the idea of a flag property from @PratikPrajapati answer in conjunction with the first part of my question.
I declared a property and initially set it as var isPaging = false. Then insidecellForItem and sizeForItem I check to see if the bool value is either true or false.
Inside the else clause of handlePagination(), I set the flag to isPaging = true and then call collectionView.reloadData() so that when the cv is reloaded, cellForItem and sizeForItem will now show the spinner inside the loading cell and give it a height of 40.
Last inside the else clause's callback I set the flag back to false and call collectionView.reloadData() again so that all the cells are updated, the spinner is no longer spinning, and the loading cell’s size is .zero:
Database...Ref?.queryOrderedByKey() ....
    // callback
    self?.isPaging = false

But as a result I would have to define two constructors for each subclass. And were I use the class I would have to add a condition every time while the Locale that we use is the same.
Unfortunate result:
open class AmountKeyListener : BaseKeyListener {

    constructor() : super()

    @RequiresApi(Build.VERSION_CODES.O)
    constructor(locale: Locale) : super(locale)
}

// usage of the keyListener
editText.keyListener = if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.O) KeyListenerUtil.AmountKeyListener(
        MY_LOCALE) else KeyListenerUtil.AmountKeyListener()

The ideal solution should be to assign the AmountKeyListener on a single line and the BaseKeyListener should know when to use our custom locale 'MY_LOCALE'
editText.keyListener = KeyListenerUtil.AmountKeyListener()

How to solve this problem?

A:

The Java solution you linked basically is just ignoring the deprecation and exclusively using the deprecated constructor. I think your last solution is the best one. Its usage is no worse than if you were using DigitsKeyListener directly--you'd still have to be checking the SDK version. 
One minor issue I see above is that your first constructor implicitly calls the empty super constructor, and thereby avoids the deprecation warning through what is essentially a language hack. Really, this seems to me to be a bug in the code inspector of Kotlin. I think it would be more appropriate to explicitly call the super constructor and also deprecate this constructor in your own class. So I would make it look like this:
abstract class BaseKeyListener : DigitsKeyListener {

    @Suppress("DEPRECATION")
    @Deprecated("Use the constructor with a locale if on SDK 26+.")
    constructor(): super()

    @RequiresApi(Build.VERSION_CODES.O)
    constructor(locale: Locale) : super(locale)
}

This doesn't functionally change how it works, but without deprecating your bare constructor, it becomes very easy to use the deprecated version of DigitsKeyListener everywhere by accident.
And at the usage site, although painful, it would look like you have it above, except you would also put @Suppress("DE

There should be a function that will have a select statement on that particular table in which  you have just inserted the record..


Q:

CAML query for filtering list view

I have a SharePoint list that I need to filter according to this:
First of all, the items must be Booked by = Travel and Meeting Support and the Category should never be visible if they are Cancelled. Beside of these conditions, I also want the following to apply:
I want to see the items which has Category = New or Category = Pending (as long as they are booked by Travel and Meeting Support). 
I do not want to see items which has Category = Completed AND Application Status = Approved. This means that I want to see Category = Completed as long as they do not have Application Status = Approved and vice versa. Of course only if they are Booked by = Travel and Meeting Support. (When it comes to Application Status = Approved, the items can not be visible if they have Category = Cancelled.)
I have tried to create a filtered view, but since it is difficult to group the conditiona snd there is a limitation of maximum 10 conditions, I can't make it work. I also tried CAML Designer, but it is not flexible enough. I also tried to modify the CAML code from the CAML designer, but still... either I get errors or I don't get the desired result.
Can anyone guide me with what I'm doing wrong?
This is one of the CAML code snippets that I've tried with:

     <Or>
        <Or>

Listing date of whole year by week number

Hi I want to list date by week number for whole year so that output is like 
Date          Week#    
21-03-2015      3
22-03-2015      3
23-03-2015      3
24-03-2015      3
25-03-2015      3
26-03-2015      3
27-03-2015      3
....
....
.....
21-12-2015      53
22-12-2015      53
23-12-2015      53
24-12-2015      53
25-12-2015      53
26-12-2015      53
27-12-2015      53

Following code will only 
   public static DateTime[] WeekDays(int Year, int WeekNumber)
    {
        DateTime start = new DateTime(Year, 1, 1).AddDays(7 * WeekNumber);
        start = start.AddDays(-((int)start.DayOfWeek));
        return Enumerable.Range(0, 7).Select(num => start.AddDays(num)).ToArray();
    }

Please let me know how to add a second range for (0, 54) so it lists date for whole year by there week number. 
Thanks 

A:

Try this, it may help you to get list of date and week number
public class DateAndWeek
{
    public DateTime Date { get; set; }
    public int WeekNumber { get; set; }
}
private List<DateAndWeek> GetListOfDateAndWeek(int startYear, int startMonth, int startDay)
{
    List<DateAndWeek> dateTimes = new List<DateAndWeek>();
    var week = 0;
    var dateTimeStart = new DateTime(startYear, startMonth, startDay);
    for (int i = 0; i < 365; i++)
    {
       var dateTime = dateTimeStart.AddDays(i);
       if (dateTime.DayOfWeek == DayOfWeek.Monday)
       {
          week++;
       }
       dateTimes.Add(new DateAndWeek { Date = dateTime, WeekNumber = week });
    }
    return dateTimes;
}

Use in this way
var list = GetList

Q:

If an Eidolon has the Flight evolution, would the Boots of Striding and Springing increase its fly speed?

A summoner's eidolon can gain the Flight evolution, which says the following:

An eidolon grows large wings, like those of a bat, bird, insect, or dragon, gaining the ability to fly. The eidolon gains a fly speed equal to its base speed. 

There are many ways to increase a creature's base speed. For example, the eidolon could put on a pair of Boots of Striding and Springing, which increases its land movement:

These boots increase the wearer’s base land speed by 10 feet. In addition to this striding ability (considered an enhancement bonus), these boots allow the wearer to make great leaps. She can jump with a +5 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks.

By default, an eidolon's base land speed depends on its base form (biped, quadruped, serpentine, etc.), and so its default fly speed should equal that amount of movement.
If an eidolon has the flight evolution, and gets an enhancement bonus to its base speed (such as using the Boots of Striding and Springing), will its fly speed also increase? Or does the eidolon's fly speed derive from its unmodified land speed?

A:

Strict RAW interpretation: Yes.
Increasing "base land speed" would increase any dependent speeds, unless specified otherwise.
It seems that "base speed", "land speed", and "base land speed" are generally synonymous terms in Pathfinder. The Core Rulebook uses these terms interchangeably. 
For example, dwarves have a "base speed of 20 feet" as a racial feature, but the rules about armored movement refer to it as simply "land speed". And later, the the section about movement in combat suggests that the speed in a creature's race entry is the same as its "base land speed":

Your speed while unarmored is your base land speed.

The Pathfinder SRD contains glossary definitions of these different usages of speeds:

Base Speed
Base speed is your unencumbered speed for a specified type of movement. Your base speed for any movement type is calculated in a similar manner as described in Base Land speed. When a speed

When you create a pivot table in Excel and add fields to Rows and Values, you get an additional field [Symbol Sigma] Values in the GUI, that you can drag and drop to Columns.
I am creating a pivot table using EPPlus. How can I add this [Symbol Sigma] Values field to my column fields?
Edit: Here is some code. I dont' see how this is supposed to help, what it was asked for.
private static ExcelWorksheet CreatePivotWorksheet(ExcelPackage excel, ExcelWorksheet dataWorksheet)
{
    string worksheetName = "Pivot";

    ExcelWorksheet pivotWorksheet = excel.Workbook.Worksheets.Add(worksheetName);

    ExcelRangeBase dataRange = dataWorksheet.Cells[dataWorksheet.Dimension.Address];
    ExcelPivotTable pivotTable = pivotWorksheet.PivotTables.Add(pivotWorksheet.Cells[1,1], dataRange, "pivotTable");

    pivotTable.RowGrandTotals = false;

    pivotTable.RowFields.Add(pivotTable.Fields["BaseValue"]);
    pivotTable.RowFields.Add(pivotTable.Fields["Remaining Runtime"])
        .AddNumericGrouping(0, 500000, 30);
    pivotTable.RowFields.Add(pivotTable.Fields["Emittent"]);
    pivotTable.RowFields.Add(pivotTable.Fields["CountIfs"]);

sqoop import failing with no command found error

I am trying to import SQL Server tables directly to HBase, below is the sqoop import syntax

I just one to fill missing gaps using the already existing columns. This approach creates new columns (f_x, g_x, f_y, g_y).
Append and contact also does not work as they repeats information (repeated rows on "a").
Any advice on how to solve this? Final result after merging df1 with df2, and after with df3 should be:
        a   b   c   d   e   f   g
    0   1   B   C   D   E   F   G
    1   2   B   C   D   E   F   G
    2   3   B   C   D   E   F   G
    3   4   B   C   D   E   NaN NaN
    4   5   B   C   D   E   NaN NaN

Eventually all the columns will be filled during the loop, so the first added (df2) will add new columns, and from df3 onwards just new data to fill all NaN. The loop looks like this:
df1 = pd.DataFrame(np.array([[1, 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'], [2, 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'], [3, 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'], [4, 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'], [5, 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']]), columns=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'])

A:

You have two issues that are causing the issue.

the code is concatenating the paths from the directions requests together, that is an issue because:
a. the directions service is asynchronous, the routes may come back in a different order than you send them (unless you send them one by one).
b. the routes requested are not continuous.

for (z = 0; z < routePath.length - 1; z++) {
  service.route({
      origin: routePath[z],
      destination: routePath[z + 1],
      travelMode: google.maps.DirectionsTravelMode.DRIVING,
      waypoints: waypts
    },
    function(result, status) {
      if (status == google.maps.DirectionsStatus.OK) {
        var snap_path = result.routes[0].overview_path;
        var traceroutePath = new google.maps.Polyline({
          strokeColor: routeColors[routeName],
          strokeOpacity: 1.0,
          strokeWeight: 2,

        traceroutePath.setPath(snap_path);
      } else alert("Directions request failed: " + status);

Q:

How to Combine JSON Objects From Different Arrays With Python

I am trying to loop through different JSON arrays using Python, in order to combine all the objects into a single data structure. The JSON looks like this:
data = {
  "Wednesday, Apr 3, 2019": [
    {
      "id": "000",
      "keyid": "4273666087",
      "name": "Raptor",
      "symbol": "RPT",
    },
    {
      "id": "111",
      "keyid": "1818114564",
      "name": "Duck",
      "symbol": "DUK",
    }
  ],
  "Tuesday, Apr 2, 2019": [
    {
      "id": "222",
      "keyid": "8032408148",
      "name": "Hawk",
      "symbol": "HWK",
    },
    {
      "id": "333",
      "keyid": "0362766431",
      "name": "Goose",
      "symbol": "GOO",
    }
  ]
}

Since it looks like a dictionary, I tried doing:
for item in data.values():
   print(item)
   print("\n")

which combines each array's objects into a separate lists. But I want all objects to be part of the same data structure, in order for the end result to look something like this:
id  | keyid      | name   | symbol
-----------------------------------
000 | 4273666087 | Raptor | RPT
-----------------------------------
111 | 1818114564 | Duck   | DUK
-----------------------------------
222 | 8032408148 | Hawk   | HWK
-----------------------------------
333 | 0362766431 | Goose  | GOO
-----------------------------------

What's the best way of doing this?

A:

Use pandas:
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame([x for k,v in data.items() for x in v])
print(df)

Output:
    id       keyid    name symbol
0  000  4273666087  Raptor    RPT
1  111  1818114564    Duck    DUK
2  222

Also of note is the Listener script at the bottom of each page (not sure if that helps?:

 try{for(a=document.querySelectorAll(".SF_lo"),i=a.length-1;i>=0;i--)a[i].style.display=x?"none":"";}catch(e){}})();
 </script>

A:

This will change the element's text accordingly to that span class containing text or not.
function updateSpan()
{
     var spanElm = document.getElementById('myspan');
        if(spanElm.innerHTML)
        {
              document.getElementsByTagName('user')[0].innerHTML = "Logged in as " + spanElm.innerHTML;
        }
        else
        {

            document.getElementsByTagName('user')[0].innerHTML = "LOGIN";
        }
}

window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function(event) {
        updateSpan();

    });

add an id to your span so we can locate it
<span style="text-transform:uppercase;"class="SFnam" id='myspan'></span>

update your bottom script with this
<script>(function(){var i,j,a,

Q:

Why is glycine considered a nonpolar amino acid but a polar molecule?

Glycine has a dipole moment, so why is it considered a nonpolar amino acid when discussing its occurrence in proteins?
Also, is the backbone of a protein nonpolar?

A:

The first part of your question illustrates a common confusion of beginners between the physiochemical properties of free amino acids in solution, and the properties of that part of an amino acid that remains after it has participated in a condensation reaction to form part of a polypeptide. They are different. (It was for that reason that I modified the question to make it clear that the ‘consideration’ of glycine as nonpolar applies to it in its protein context.)
I have prepared a diagram to clarify.

As can be seen on line 1, all free amino acids at physiological pH are charged because of the pKa of the  α-amino and α-carboxyl groups (proline, as an imino acid is the exception). The chemical features common to all amino acids are shown in blue, for the second amino acid, and the unique feature — wherein amino acids differ — is shown in red.
To show amino acid 2 in the context of a polypeptide chain, I have condensed it with two other amino acids (1 and 3) to produce a tripeptide (line 3). (This is the situation most amino acids in a long polypeptide chain will be in, as there are only two that will be at the ends.)
You can see from the colouring that what is left of the amino acid in the protein — the amino acid residue — has lost the charges of the α-amino and α-carboxyl groups, which have become parts of peptide bonds. (A molecule of water is removed in a condensation.)
The properties that a particular amino acid endows to a protein are those of the ‘R-group’— R2 in the diagram. In the case of glycine, R is H, so that in the context of proteins we regard glycine as a non-polar amino acid (The C-H bond has a negligible dipole.)
Don’t confuse R with residue. It is a side-chain, designated using a common chemical abbreviation.

The second question was “is the backbone of the macromolecule nonpolar?”.
No. The backbone of a protein has partial charges on the oxygen and nitrogen atoms of the peptide bond, as shown below. This is because it has a partial

Q:

How to revoke `requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent(false)` without lifting finger (Action.UP or Cancel)?

I have WebView(s) inside the RecyclerView. In order to get smooth scrolling experience such that when user scrolls, the RecyclerView will be responsible for scrolling (WebView should not scroll) I called getParent().requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent(false); inside webview#onTouchEvent(event) when there is only one touch point and is moving vertcially (scrolling up and down). 
private void handleSingleFingerTouch(MotionEvent ev) {
        switch (ev.getAction()) {
            case MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN:
                x1 = ev.getX();
                y1 = ev.getY();
                break;
            case MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE:
                x2 = ev.getX();
                y2 = ev.getY();
                // -ve param for canScrollHorizontally is to check scroll left. +ve otherwise
                if (Math.abs(x1 - x2) >= Math.abs(y1 - y2)
                        && canScrollHorizontally((int) (x1 - x2))) {
                    // scrolling horizontally. Retain the touch inside the webView.
                    getParent().requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent(true);
                } else {
                    // scrolling vertically. Share the touch event with the parent.
                    getParent().requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent(false);
                }
                x1 = x2;
                y1 = y2;
        }
    }

@Override
public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent ev) {
    boolean multiTouch = ev.getPointerCount() > 1;
    if (multiTouch) {
        getParent().requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent(true);
    } else {
        handleSingleFingerTouch(ev);
    }
    return super.onTouchEvent(ev);
}

It works as expected with just one bug, I found that while RecyclerView(and webview) scrolling and I touch inside the WebView, then RecyclerView stops scrolling as expected, then if I don't lift up my finger but keep finger on the screen and try to zoom, the

Connecting a link to an image

I am using MediaWiki in combination with Joomla. As I want to add icons to some links I need to connect both. I know that this is possible through putting the img tag inside the a tag.
BUT the problem is that some links are generated throgh a function called makeListItem that MediaWiki uses for more than just these links. Now my question is, can I somehow connect the img to the a without putting it inside the a tag?
This calls the function to create the elements:
<?php $this->renderNavigation( 'PERSONAL' ); ?>

The actual function (shortened):
foreach ( $personalTools as $key => $item ) {
    ?>
    <div class="searchbox" style="clear:both;">
    <img src="<?php echo $icon[$key] ?>" alt="p-Icons" class="iconnav"/>
    <?php
    echo $this->makeListItem( $key, $item );
    ?>
    </div>
<?php
}
?>

The src of the image is defined in a array that is declared just above the foreach.
Thanks in advance

A:

You have to modify your makeListItem() function (BaseTemplate class). 
function makeListItem( $key, $item, $options = array() ) {
    if ( isset( $item['links'] ) ) {
        $links = array();
        foreach ( $item['links'] as $linkKey => $link ) {
            $links[] = $this->makeLink( $linkKey, $link, $options );
        }
        $html = implode( ' ', $links );
    } else {
        $link = $item;
        // These keys are used by makeListItem and shouldn't be passed on to the link
        foreach ( array( 'id', 'class', 'active', 'tag', 'itemtitle' ) as $k ) {
            unset( $link[$k] );
        }
        if ( isset( $item['id'] ) && !isset( $item['single-id'] ) ) {
            // The id goes on the <li> not on the <a> for single links
            // but makeSidebarLink still needs to

Python if statement

print("this program will calculate the area")

input("[Press any key to start]")

width = int(input("enter width"))
if width < 0:
    print ("please chose a number between 0-1000")
    width = int(input("enter width"))

if width > 1000000:
    print ("please chose a number between 0-1000")
    width = int(input("enter width"))

height = int(input("Enter Height"))

area = width*height

print("The area is:",area)

Is there a way i can condense the code below for example fit them together so i won't have to write just about the same line of code except the less then and greater then statement twice.
width = int(input("enter width"))
if width < 0:
    print ("please chose a number between 0-1000")
    width = int(input("enter width"))

if width > 1000000:
    print ("please chose a number between 0-1000")
    width = int(input("enter width"))

I have tried 
width = int(input("enter width"))
if width < 0 and > 10000:
    print ("please chose a number between 0-1000")
    width = int(input("enter width"))

But i get no love.
I also don't want to type 
width = int(input("enter width"))

statement twice if it can be helped.
Thanks
Ben

A:

There are a few ways to do it. The most explicit is this:
if width < 0 or width > 10000:

but my favourite is this:
if not 0 <= width <= 10000:

A:

You need a loop.  Otherwise, the user can still enter an invalid value if they are persistent.  The while statement combines a loop with a conditional - it keeps looping until the condition is broken.
width = -1
while width < 0 or width > 10000:
    width = int(input("enter width as a positive integer < 10000"))

Your use of the if statement in the original question is syntactically incorrect:
if width < 0 and > 10000:

You want:
if not (0 < width < 1000):
    ask_for_new_input()

or

This is where my issue comes in. I found a script that prints out all your instances on the server, too. Like this:

Subquery returned more than 1 value. This is not permitted when the
  subquery follows =, !=, <, <= , >, >= or when the subquery is used as

Q:

Not Equals In Where Clause Uses Filesort, But Equals Doesn't. Why?

I'm revamping my site's inner-mail system, and I came across something I don't understand. Here are the tables:
CREATE TABLE `mails` (
    `id` bigint(12) unsigned not null auto_increment,
    `recipient_id` mediumint(8) unsigned not null,
    `date_sent` datetime not null,
    `status` enum('unread', 'read', 'deleted') default 'unread',
    PRIMARY KEY(`id`),
    INDEX(`recipient_id`, `status`, `date_sent`),
    CONSTRAINT FOREIGN KEY (`recipient_id`) REFERENCES `members` (`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE
) ENGINE=InnoDB;

CREATE TABLE `mail_contents` (
    `mail_id` bigint(12) unsigned not null,
    `sender_id` mediumint(8) unsigned not null,
    `subject` varchar(150) default '',
    `content` text not null,
    CONSTRAINT FOREIGN KEY (`sender_id`) REFERENCES `members` (`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    CONSTRAINT FOREIGN KEY (`mail_id`) REFERENCES `mails` (`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE
) ENGINE=InnoDB;

And here's the query:
SELECT *
FROM mails AS m
LEFT JOIN mail_contents AS mc ON mc.mail_id = m.id
WHERE recipient_id = 66
AND status != 'deleted'
ORDER BY date_sent DESC
LIMIT 40\G

An EXPLAIN on the query shows "Using where; Using index; Using filesort". However if I change the query to this:
SELECT *
FROM mails AS m
LEFT JOIN mail_contents AS mc ON mc.mail_id = m.id
WHERE recipient_id = 66
AND status = 'sent'
ORDER BY date_sent DESC
LIMIT 40\G

The EXPLAIN shows "Using where; Using index". For some reason using != in the first query causes a filesort, but using = in the

Как определить временную зону зашедшего на сайт?

На сайте есть новости с указанием времени, когда они были опубликованы. Время указывается по Москве, например 12:00. Если человек зайдет допустим из Лондона, то он увидит, что новость опубликована в полдень, хотя у него еще только 8 утра(если не ошибаюсь). 

У меня два вопроса.

Как определить часовой пояс.

Как лучше в таком случае отображать время, если человек зашел из другой временной зоны? Может добавлять приписку "время по Москве"?

A:

Лучше всего, не нагружать свой сервер лишними вычислениями, а просто отдавать время в unixtime, и силами браузера, на js уже преобразовывать его в понятное человеку время, а js тем самым уже сам подгонит его под часовой пояс пользователя.

A:

Вот варианты решения:

Ну например: smart-ip.net - там есть сервис по определению часового пояса по IP, ограничения 5000 запросов с одного айпи в сутки. Запросы через http/https, возвращает XML или JSON. (Я думаю не стоит так возиться с часовыми поясами...)

Grails spring Security UI

I’m new to Grails and I’m trying to build a simple help desk application. I want to be able to register a new user, log in, post a request/incident, save it to a database and from administrator side I want to be able to see all requests/incidents in a table, and change permissions of users. 
For the security part (and security management) I was thinking of using Spring security & Spring security UI plugins. 
For now I’ve created application, installed both spring security and its UI extension, added the realname, email and company properties. When  I run the application,  I manage to successfully register and when I confirm registration from email i’m automatically logged in, but when I try to log in with different browser I get the following error :
“Sorry, we were not able to find a user with that username and password”
But there is one in the database.
Also, I want to have, lets say Incident domain class where I will persist all incidents/request data. The relationship between the User and Incident domain classes will be one to many. Do I just implement that like any other relationship or do I have to do something special because User is implemented by Spring Security?
I’m open for any suggestions.

A:

There's an incompatibility between the latest spring-security-core and spring-security-ui 0.1.2.  In particular, spring-security-core moved password encoding into beforeInsert/beforeUpdate event handlers in the User class.  RegisterController.register controller in spring-security-ui doesn't know about this yet, and tries to encode it again, resulting in a doubly encoded password.  To fix, override the RegisterController and change the register action to:
def register = { RegisterCommand command ->

    if (command.hasErrors()) {
        render view: 'index', model: [command: command]
        return
    }

    def user = lookupUserClass().newInstance(email: command.email, username: command.username,
                                             password: command.password, accountLocked: true, enabled: true)
    if (!user.validate() || !user.save()) {
        // TODO
    }

    def registrationCode = new RegistrationCode(username: user.username).save()
    String url = generateLink('

Querying is now very easy:
graphClient.Cypher
    .Match("(c:Category)")
    .Where((Category c) => c.UniqueId == someGuidVariable)
    .Return(c => c.As<Category>())
    .Results
    .Single();

Rather than looking up a category node, to then do another query, just do it all in one go:
var productsInCategory = graphClient.Cypher
    .Match("(c:Category)<-[:IN_CATEGORY]-(p:Product)")
    .Where((Category c) => c.UniqueId == someGuidVariable)
    .Return(p => p.As<Product>())
    .Results;

If you want to update a category, do that in one go as well:
graphClient.Cypher
    .Match("(c:Category)")
    .Where((Category c) => c.UniqueId == someGuidVariable)
    .Update("c = {category}")
    .WithParams(new { category })
    .ExecuteWithoutResults();

Finally, your CategoryAdd method currently 1) does one DB hit to find an existing node, 2) a second DB hit to create a new one, 3) a third DB hit to update the ID on it. Instead, you can compress all of this to a single call too using the MERGE keyword:
public Category GetOrCreateCategoryByName(string name)
{
    return graphClient.Cypher
        .WithParams(new {
            name,
            newIdIfRequired = Guid.NewGuid()
        })
        .Merge("(c:Category { Name = {name})")
        .OnCreate("c")
        .Set("c.UniqueId = {newIdIfRequired}")
        .Return(c => c.As<Category>())
        .Results
        .Single();
}

Basically,

Don't use Neo4j's internal ids as a way to hack around managing your own identities. (But they may release some form of autonumbering in the future. Even if they do, domain identities like email addresses or SKUs or airport codes or ... are preferred. You don't even always need an id: you can often infer a node based on its position in the

I'm writing a simple jquery animation to show/hide a block of stuff when the title is clicked. 
The markup looks like this:
<section class="infoblock off">
<h2><span class="sectiontitle rounded-right">TITLE (click to show/hide)</span></h2>
<div class="info"></div><!--info-->
</section>

My javascript looks like this:
        $(".infoblock h2").click( function(event) {
        //console.log('show info');

        if ( $(this).parent( $('.infoblock') ).hasClass('off') ) {          
            $(this).parent( $('.infoblock') ).removeClass('off');
            $(this).parent( $('.infoblock') ).addClass('on').children( $('.info') ).show(300);
            console.log( 'On function. Parent class= '+$(this).parent( $('.infoblock') ).attr('class') );

        } else if ( $(this).parent( $('.infoblock') ).hasClass('on') ) {
            $(this).parent( $('.infoblock') ).removeClass('on');
            $(this).parent( $('.infoblock') ).addClass('off');
            $(this).parent( $('.infoblock') ).children( $('.info') ).hide(300);
            console.log( 'Off function. Parent class= '+$(this).parent( $('.infoblock') ).attr('class') );
        }

    });

This works BUT when I click the title the second time to hide the .info <div> the  title gets hidden as well. WHY?!

A:

demo : http://jsfiddle.net/RQ2Cw/1/
instead of parent use closest, and instead ofchildren use find
$(".infoblock h2").click(function(event) {
    //console.log('show info');
    if ($(this).closest('.infoblock').hasClass('off')) {
        $(this).closest('.infoblock').removeClass('off');

Policy on recycling example questions from Area 51

I've not followed a proposal all the way though beta before.  We have example questions that are submitted in the definition phase.
http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/43283/space-exploration?phase=definition&tab=votes#tab-top
These did not get automatically posted to this beta (or at least not all).  So would it be valid to copy one of those?  Have other people already done this?  Is it impolite to copy someone else's question?

A:

Are any of them a question you actual have? Then go ahead an ask it.
But "recycling example questions" isn't exactly the goal of a private beta. You're not supposed to be asking questions simply for the sake of filling the site with stuff. Please at least read:
Your New Site: Asking the First Questions
The biggest challenge facing this particular site will be gaining some semblance of expertise. I live on the Space Coast of Florida, and these don't sound like the  day-to-day problems folks in the aerospace industry would ask. 
The problem is, if this site takes on the tone of a middle school science club, we're not building a site for experts. It's really too early to judge, but this site has the early earmarks of our failed Artificial Intelligence site, with a conspicuous lack of expert-level questions (and answers) posted mostly by the merely curious. I hope we can overcome that hurdle because I like this subject, but I don't find the questions (or answers) all that intriguing or insightful.

A:

In my experience with other sites, it is perfectly acceptable to post questions from the definition period on the beta site. Most of the questions voted up there will also be good, on-topic questions here.
However, sometimes these questions are not perfectly ready for the site as is. Sometimes these questions do need a bit of refinement, or a bit of background research before they get posted. Some of them might need split into multiple questions, etc. Feel free to post them, but make sure to clean them up and support the question when you do.

A:

I think it would be courteous to give the individual who originally posted the question some time to post it themselves. Not that it actually matters, but it just seems kinda like

Can I flatten (maybe not the right term) so the groupings are in a single document. I would like the result to look like:
{
    "id": "xyz-800", 
    "site": "xyz", 
    "user": 800, 
    "mnoGroup": "<10%", 
    "mnoRaw": "1", 
    "ijkGroup": "Moderate", 
    "ijkRaw": "23"
}

In reality I would like the mnoGroup and mnoRaw attributes to be created no matter if the attribute groupings.type = "MNO" exists or not.  Same with the ijk attributes.

A:

You can use $arrayElemAt to read the groupings array by index in the first project stage and $ifNull to project optional values in the final project stage. Litte verbose, but'll see what I can do.
db.groupmore.aggregate({
    "$project": {
        _id: 1,
        site: 1,
        user: 1,
        mnoGroup: {
            $arrayElemAt: ["$groupings", 0]
        },
        ijkGroup: {
            $arrayElemAt: ["$groupings", -1]
        }
    }
}, {
    "$project": {
        _id: 1,
        site: 1,
        user: 1,
        mnoGroup: {
            $ifNull: ["$mnoGroup.group", "Unspecified"]
        },
        mnoRaw: {
            $ifNull: ["$mnoGroup.raw", "Unspecified"]
        },
        ijkGroup: {
            $ifNull: ["$ijkGroup.group", "Unspecified"]
        },
        ijkRaw: {
            $ifNull: ["$ijkGroup.raw", "Unspecified"]
        }
    }
})

Sample Output
{ "_id" : "xyz-800", "site" : "xyz", "user" : 800, "mnoGroup" : "<10%", "mnoRaw" : "1", "ijkGroup" : "Moderate", "ijkRaw" : "23" }

Google+ button iframe error

I am working on a generator which helps in creating social buttons all under one roof. I was able to create generator for Facebook & Twitter but there is an issue with Google+ button at the very beginning.
I searched a lot but could not find a proper answer to "refused to display.... 'X-Frame-Options' to 'SAMEORIGIN'".

Once this problem solved I will be dynamically changing the button and its parameters based on user input and then will be re-intializing the button so that changes can be seen live.
Is there any other approach that I can follow like directly adding the iframe?

A:

in your code, you save data into firebase before the data (date, time, timereserved) change, so nothing saved in firebase.
you can setValue whenever the data/time value changed like this (I edit directly from the code in your post):
public class Room1 extends AppCompatActivity {

@RequiresApi(api = Build.VERSION_CODES.N)
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.room1);

    final Calendar c = Calendar.getInstance();
    final int year = c.get(Calendar.YEAR);
    final int month = c.get(Calendar.MONTH);
    final int day = c.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH);
    final int hour = c.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY);
    final int minute1 = c.get(Calendar.MINUTE);
    final Calendar v = Calendar.getInstance();
    final int hour2 = v.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY);
    final int minute2 = v.get(Calendar.MINUTE);

A:

We write loops like:
 for(x = 0; x < 10; x++)

The language could have been defined so that loops looked like:
 for(x = 0, x < 10, x++)

However, think of the same loop implemented using a while loop:
 x = 0;
 while(x < 10)
 {
     x++;
 }

Notice that the x=0 and x++ are statements, ended by semicolons. They aren't expressions like you would have in a function call. Semicolons are used to separate statements, and since two of the three elements in a for loop are statements, that's what is used there. A for loop is just a shortcut for such a while loop.
Additionally, the arguments don't really act like arguments to a function. The second and third are repeatedly evaluated. It's true they aren't a sequence, but they also aren't function arguments. 
Also, the fact that you can use commas to have multiple statements in the for loop is actually something you can do outside the for loop. 
x = 0, y= 3;

is a perfectly valid statement even outside of a for loop. I don't know of any practical use outside the for loop though. But the point is that commas always subdivide statements; it's not a special feature of the for loop.

A:

So why in the same languages such mapping is reversed for for loops.

Technically, the mapping is not "reversed".

The things separated by commas are not parameters.  In (at least) C++ and Java, they can be declarations, so they are not even expressions.
The things separated by semicolons are not (single) statements either.

In reality what we have here is a different syntactic context where the same symbols are being used differently.  We are not comparing like with like, so there is no mapping, and no strong argument for a consistent mapping based on semantic consistency.
So why not do it the other way around?
Well I think the reasons come from the "natural" meaning of , and ;.  In English written language, a semicolon is "stronger" break than a comma, and the glyph for semicolon is more visible than a comma.  Those two things combine to make current arrangement seem (to me!) to be more natural.
But

Every year or 2, I buy a bulk quantity of water softener salt. I always get 25kg bags and I buy 20-40 bags in order to get them at the best price.
I'm then left with a problem. I have space to store them in my attic room (where they need to be, alongside the water softener), but that means I have to transport all of the bags up a flight of stairs (just one, thankfully), to the attic room.
Carrying just one of them by hand is just about doable; doing it 20-40 times is impossible.
I've considered some form of winch, but any permanent/expensive equipment is overkill given the fact that it will only be used every year or 2.
Any ideas for how to move them without back-breaking effort?
Yes, smaller bags would work, yes a smaller quantity would work but both would cost more money. Opening the bags and dividing them is impractical because I would have to reseal them all afterwards. Leaving them downstairs and spreading the work is also a non-starter due to space constraints.
EDIT: although a diagram is overkill, here is a description of the "landscape" within which this needs to take place: 1) the stairs are a straight, single flight of 13 steps, 2) there is a large area of clear floor-space at the bottom of the stairs within which to work, 3) there is a doorway about 1 metre opposite the top of the stairs i.e. useful for bracing a pulley mechanism against, 4) this gives about 5 metres of working space at the top of the stairs, 5) the ceiling above the stairs follows the slope of the stairs from bottom to top, 6) the stairs are carpeted but 7) I wouldn't want to damage it.

A:

Consider using the laws of physics as your ally.
If you don't lift the sacks but pull them up a slope, you need a lot less strength and eliminate the risk of stumbling on the stairs.
So you need first a slope:
A few sheets of thin plywood will do. You need enough to cover the length of your stairs plus a few strips of duct tape or similar. If you are really crafty, you can even create something that can be folded accordion-style and stored for future use. (Or go all the way and do something with hinges?) But make it narrow enough so that you can

    def __refresh(self):
        self.cleanView()
        for row in self.__recordset:

    def filter_records(self, column, value):
        print("Filter Log Recordset by {column} and {value}".format(**locals()))
        # Filter functionality works as expected

    def cell_context(self, event):
        __cMenu=tk.Menu(self, tearoff=0)

        if self.__recordset_filtered:
            __cMenu.add_command(label="Show all", command=lambda: filter_records(0, ""))

        else:
            column=2
            options=["INFO", "WARNING", "DEBUG"]

            for i in range(len(options)):
                option=options[i]
                __cMenu.add_command(label="{}".format(option), command=lambda: self.filter_records(column, option))
            # Also tried using for option in options here with same result as now
        __cMenu.post(event.x_root, event.y_root)

if __name__=="__main__":
    root=tk.Tk()
    app=SomeClass(root)
    root.mainloop()

The current output i get is:

Filter Log Recordset by 2 and DEBUG

No matter which of the three options i choose. I assume it has sth to do with the garbage collection that only the last option remains but i cannot figure out how to avoid this.
Any help is recommended.

A:

Please read about minimal examples. Without reading your code, I believe you have run into a well known issue addressed in previous questions and answers that needs 2 lines to illustrate.  Names in function bodies are evaluated when the function is executed.
funcs = [lambda: i for i in range(3)]
for f in funcs: print(f())

prints '2' 3 times because the 3 functions are identical and the 'i' in each is not evaluated until the call, when i == 2.  However,
funcs = [lambda i=i:i for i in range(3)]
for f in funcs: print(f())

makes three different functions

Q:

is it wrong to call a method outside main()

I was wondering if someone could explain the meaning of the following error:
CODE
    #include "sstream"

    std::stringstream h;

    h.str(""); //clearing the stringstream object

    int main()

ERROR

kial.cpp:5:1: error: ‘h’ does not name a type  h.str("");

Also why is it wrong to try to access the method ouside of the main()?

A:

OK, so everyone landed here with a simple statement saying that you cannot do it. Trust no one. In fact, you can. But not like you have tried to do it. Generally, you cannot have statements like function calls outside other functions. And the first function to get called is always main. However, C++ has RAII and global objects. Therefore, there is only one exception to the above rule - construction and destruction of global objects. By employing RAII and declaring some object global, you can have its constructor called, and do the rest from there. So for example, you could solve you problem like this:
#include <sstream>
#include <iostream> // just for std::cout and std::endl.

std::stringstream h;

struct MyStruct {
    MyStruct() {
        h.str(""); //clearing the stringstream object
        std::cout << "`h` string stream is cleared now!" << std::endl;
    }
};

MyStruct mystruct;

int main()
{
    std::cout << "I am called AFTER MyStruct's constructor" << std::endl;
}

Compile and run:
$ g++ -Wall -pedantic -std=c++98 ./test.cc  && ./test
`h` string stream is cleared now!
I am called AFTER MyStruct's constructor

Hope it helps. Good Luck!

A:

The compiler is assuming you tried to make a declaration (or a definition), since general statements are not allowed at global scope.
The short answer to why this is not allowed is that the standard says so.
To think through why that is the answer, consider when you would expect the code to execute. What does it mean to call a function at global (or namespace) scope

Q:

Do the constructors of React Components need the props argument?

Should I include the props argument in the constructor and call to super if I am not using props at all for a component?
For example, if I write:
class NotePage extends React.Component<void, State> {
    constructor(){
        super();
        this.state = {
            filterStr: "string"
        };
    }
    ...
}

Will this cause any issues?
I'm asking because if I include props then flow complains about a missing annotation and one way to solve the problem is to remove the props argument.

A:

From official docs React Constructor

you should call super(props) before any other statement. Otherwise, this.props will be undefined in the constructor, which can lead to bugs

constructor(props) {

  // no super call
}

If you don't call it, the data passed from parent as properties is not available inside child component's constructor with props. Props will, however, still be available in the rest of the component, such as the render function.
e.g.
class Parent extends React.Component{

    render(){

        return (<Child  mydata = {'some data here'}/>)
    }
}

class Child extends React.Component{

   constructor(){
    super(); //no props
    this.props.mydata //will be undefined
   }

  render(){
    this.props.mydata //defined
  }
}

A:

First of all you don't need constructor function at all, when you are not accessing props in initialization of component. You can write your state this way:
class NotePage extends React.Component<void, State> {
   state = {
      filterStr: "string"
   }
    ...
}

Only when you are using props for initialization you need to , make use of constructor and call this way:
class NotePage extends React.Component<void, State> {
    constructor(props){
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            filterStr: "string"
        };
    }
    ...
}

Hope this helps !!
I found a great link written by @dan Abramov (react core team). this also might help

Is it possible to have facet to return as an object instead of an array? It seems a bit counter intuitive to need to access result[0].total instead of just result.total
code (using mongoose):
        Model
            .aggregate()
            .match({
                "name": { "$regex": name },
                "user_id": ObjectId(req.session.user.id),
                "_id": { "$nin": except }
            })
            .facet({
                "results": [
                    { "$skip": start },
                    { "$limit": finish },
                    {
                        "$project": {
                            "map_levels": 0,
                            "template": 0
                        }
                    }
                ],
                "total": [
                    { "$count": "total" },
                ]
            })
            .exec() 

A:

Each field you get using $facet represents separate aggregation pipeline and that's why you always get an array. You can use $addFields to overwrite existing total with single element. To get that first item you can use $arrayElemAt
Model
    .aggregate()
    .match({
        "name": { "$regex": name },
        "user_id": ObjectId(req.session.user.id),
        "_id": { "$nin": except }
    })
    .facet({
        "results": [
            { "$skip": start },
            { "$limit": finish },
            {
                "$project": {
                    "map_levels": 0,
                    "template": 0
                }
            }
        ],
        "total": [
            { "$count": "total" },
        ]
    })
    .addFields({
        "total": {
            $arrayElemAt: [ "$total", 0 ]
        }
    })
    .exec()

A:

You can try this as well
Model
.aggregate()
.match({
  "name": { "$regex": name },
  "user_id": ObjectId(req.session.user.id),
  "_id": { "$nin": except }
})
.facet({
  "results": [
    { "$skip": start },
    

namespace detail {

    template <class T> char test(int T::*)
    {
       std::cout << "Came to one\n";
       return 0;
    }

    template <class T> int test(...)
    {
       std::cout << "Came to two\n";
       return 0;
    }
}

struct A {};

int main()
{
   detail::test<A>(0);
   detail::test<int>(0);
}

When tested with g++ 4.8.2, it produces the following output:

Came to one
Came to two

My question: why is the first version of detail::test unambiguously chosen for the first call?
Update
In the absence of the first version of details::test, the code from main compiles fine. When it is there, the compiler thinks it's a better match for detail::test<A>() than the second one.
Update 2
After reading about a pointer to member is well-formed even for incomplete types or without members of the designated type., I tried the following and it works.
struct A;

int main()
{
   detail::test<A>(0);
   detail::test<int>(0);
}

The C++11 standard has quite a few places to uncover concepts that I wouldn't have thought of.

A:

The compiler goes through the Holy Trinity of Name Lookup, Argument Deduction and Overload Resolution. Name lookup finds two overloads for test, and the argument deduction of a pointer to member will fail for a non-class type, but not for incomplete types or missing members. Finally, out of the viable candidates, overload resolution picks the best match (the ellipsis conversion being the lowest rank).

There are three relevant Standard quotes here:
According to the Example in 8.3.3 Pointers to members [dcl.mptr]/2 a pointer to member is well-formed even for incomplete types or without members of the designated type. 
According to 14.8.2 Template argument deduction [temp.deduct]/8: 

If a substitution results in an invalid type or expression, type
  deduction fails.

One of the many examples listed is: 

Attempting to create “pointer to member of T” when T is

 result = Join[ConstantArray["A", {3, n}], ConstantArray["T", {3, n}]];

 Last[Dimensions[result]]
 columnlabels = Range[Last[Dimensions[result]]];
 newcolumnlabels = 
 Rotate[StringTake["00000" <> ToString[#], -5], \[Pi]/2] & /@ columnlabels;
 Grid[Join[{newcolumnlabels}, 
 Map[Column[#, Alignment -> Center] & /@ Transpose[{#}] &]@result], 
 Frame -> All]

However, if one sets n=100 and runs the remaining commands again, one gets each column label and subsequent columns as before, but with more (undesired) space added on either side.  If one sets
n = 200 then runs the remaining commands again the labels are no longer properly rotated 90 degrees, but rather 180 degrees and not in a simple linear fashion that suggests some spacing issue or some long line issue in the notebook front end is involved.
How can one force the labels in the output to remain properly rotated 90 degrees in a single column one character wide (as when n=50) even for a matrix with very many columns?  As I may have as many as 20,000 columns, but more typically 2000-3000 columns, each requiring a suitably formatted label, it is important that each column be as narrow as possible (a single character wide with a minimum of spacing for readability).  Currently I do not understand why, with respect to label formatting, the results for larger values of n are different than those for n=50.
I've played with options Alignment and Spacings, but to no practical avail, but perhaps I've missed something subtle.
Creation of a large grid takes quite a while and I wonder if exporting the resultant graph to a .PDF file might not be faster than the time it takes to reformat the notebook given the very long lines in the output.

A:

You can wrap Grid with Style with the option LineBreakWithin -> False :
n = 100;
result = Join[ConstantArray["A", {3, n}], ConstantArray["T", {3, n}]];
columnlabels = Range[Last[Dimensions[result]]];
newcolumnlabels = Rotate[StringTake["00000" <> ToString[#], -5], \[Pi]/2] & /@ 
   columnlabels

How to Highlighting Search Results Using Apache SOLR with PHP code

Any one guide me the way to highlighting Solr search results. I am using DomDocument for to parse the xml results.
Here, I have the sample document like below.
<add><doc>
<field name="id">1</field><field name="title">Leason1</field>
<field name="description">XYZ</field>
</doc></add>

I am getting the search results by using below function,
 function solrQuery($q){

 $query = "?q=".trim(urlencode($q)).
"&version=2.2&start=0&rows=10&indent=on&hl=true&hl.fl=title";

 if($q != '')
   return $results = request("", "select".$query);
   return 0;
 }

....
In my result page I ve display the data like below,
$results = solrQuery($query);
if($results != ''){
$results = explode('<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>', $results);
$results = $results[1];
$dom = new DomDocument;
$dom->loadXML($results);
$docs = $dom->getElementsByTagName('doc');
foreach ($docs as $doc) {
 $strings = $doc->getElementsByTagName('str');
 foreach($strings as $str){
   $attr = $str->getAttribute('name');
   $data = $str->textContent;
   switch($attr){
   case 'id':
    $id = $data;
    break;
   case 'title':
    $title = $data;
    break;
   case 'description':
    $description = $data;
    break;
    } 
 }

Here is the code I get confusion how to Highlight search results. Can you help me for this?

A:

You don't have to manually highlight your documents from Solr in PHP. Solr already provides highlighting functionality.
Executing a Solr query like http://path/to/solr:8983/?q=keyword&hl=true&hl.fl=title,text will return something like:
<result name="response" numFound

The answer to your first question, per the Runtime Configuration File Documentation:
And the answer to your second question, is to remove remove preserveCompilationContext in your project.json file (and rebuild).

MyApp.deps.json is a list of dependencies, as well as compilation context data and compilation dependencies. Not technically required, but required to use the servicing or package cache/shared package install features.

Per your comment to Dimitry, I couldn't tell if you have .net core installed in your target machine and therefore infer the kind of deployment you are trying to do. But assuming it is installed, you should be able to tune your myproject.runtime.json to fix your problems. In case you don't, I highly recommend reading about the two different types of .NET Core Application Deployment:

You can create two types of deployments for .NET Core applications:
Framework-dependent deployment. As the name implies,
  framework-dependent deployment (FDD) relies on a shared system-wide
  version of .NET Core to be present on the target system. Because .NET
  Core is already present, your app is also portable between
  installations of .NET Core. Your app contains only its own code and
  any third-party dependencies that are outside of the .NET Core
  libraries. FDDs contain .dll files that can be launched by using the
  dotnet utility from the command line. For example, dotnet app.dll runs
  an application named app.
Self-contained deployment. Unlike FDD, a self-contained deployment
  (SCD) does not rely on any shared components to be present on the
  target system. All components, including both .NET Core libraries and
  the .NET Core runtime, are included with the application and are
  isolated from other .NET Core applications. SCDs include an executable
  (such as app.exe on Windows platforms for an application named app),
  which is a renamed version of the platform-specific .NET Core host,
  and a .dll file (such as app.dll), which is the actual application.

A:

*.deps.json comes from preserveCompilationContext. 
Preserving the compilation context is useful for runtime compilation (i.e. just-in-time compilation) and especially for compiling views. It is not usually useful for

Q:

User Defined Function returning same results on different tabs

I have this code that analyzes stock returns, I'm planning on having 10-20 tabs with a different stock on each tab:
Function myStrategyReturn(sell As Double, buy As Double) As Double

Dim x As Double

Application.Volatile

changes = Range("H2:H263")

PreviousFlag = "Buy"

startingBalance = Range("P5").Value

newBal = Range("P5").Value

For i = UBound(changes) To 1 Step -1

x = changes(i, 1)
If PreviousFlag = "Sell" Then

    If x <= buy Then

        PreviousFlag = "Buy"

    Else

        newBal = newBal

    End If

ElseIf x <= buy Or i = UBound(changes) Then

    newBal = (newBal * (1 + x))
    PreviousFlag = "Buy"

ElseIf x < sell And x > buy Then 'our return is below the sell threshold, but above the buy

    newBal = (newBal * (1 + x))
    PreviousFlag = "Buy"

ElseIf x >= sell Then

    newBal = (newBal * (1 + x))
    PreviousFlag = "Sell"

End If

Next i

myStrategyReturn = ((newBal - startingBalance) / startingBalance)

End Function

The problem I'm having is each tab is currently returning the same result. The formula inputs are always the same, but range H2:H263 is different. For some reason the formula keeps returning the returns of the tab where I last did a full calculation. 

A:

Gary's solution would work, here's an alternative that captures your inputs in the formula which is better than trying to have it coded in VBA.
Function myStrategyReturn(sell As Double, buy As Double, Changes As Range, startingBalance As Range) As Double

Dim x As Double, i As Long, previousFlag As String

'may not need this.
Application.Volatile

previousFlag = "Buy"

Dim Newbal As Double

Newbal = startingBalance.Value

For i = UBound(Changes) To 1 Step -1

A:

You aren't setting the mail header there, you are setting the http header. This function header is sending a raw HTTP header, it isn't doing anything for the email you are sending
   header('Content-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8');

You need to add the header "Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8" (for HTML Email bodies)  or "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8" (for Plain Text Email bodies)  to your mail function. Like this.
$headers = array("Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8");
mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers)

Additionally, for email, each lines should be separated

I try delete excluded types from my object. And think in should work, but I don't understand, why 'company_accountant' still in the array.
And mayby you can help me and advice more elegant way to search and delete excluded types?
var data = [
    {id: 1, type: "exempt_dealer"},
    {id: 2, type: "licensed_dealer"},
    {id: 3, type: "partnership"},
    {id: 4, type: "company"},
    {id: 5, type: "licensed_dealer_accountant"},
    {id: 6, type: "company_accountant"},
    {id: 7, type: "partnership_accountant"}
];

var exclude_types = [
    'company_accountant',
    'licensed_dealer_accountant',
    'partnership_accountant'
];

angular.forEach(data, function (value, key) {
    if(exclude_types.includes(value.type)){
        data.splice(key, 1);
    }
});

data should be: 
data = [
    {id: 1, type: "exempt_dealer"},
    {id: 2, type: "licensed_dealer"},
    {id: 3, type: "partnership"},
    {id: 4, type: "company"}
];

but for some reason:
{id: 1, type: "exempt_dealer"},
{id: 2, type: "licensed_dealer"},
{id: 3, type: "partnership"},
{id: 4, type: "company"},
{id: 6, type: "company_accountant"}

A:

splice mutates the array during iteration. You should use Array.filter

var data = [{id: 1, type: "exempt_dealer"},{id: 2, type: "licensed_dealer"},{id: 3, type: "partnership"},{id: 4, type: "company"},{id: 5, type: "licensed_dealer_accountant"},{id: 6, type: "company_accountant"},{id: 7, type: "partnership_account

Show that $g\circ f\equiv 0$ implies $\det Df\equiv 0$, where $g(x_1,...,x_n)=x_1^5+...+x_n^5$

Let $f:\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ be a smooth function and let $g:\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be defined by $g(x_1,...,x_n)=x_1^5+...+x_n^5$. Suppose $g\circ f\equiv 0$. Show that $\det Df\equiv 0$.
I was going to start the solution from $n=2$ and then use induction on $n$.
So, for $n=2$, $f:\mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ is a smooth function and $g:\mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ where $g(x_1,x_2)=x_1^5+x_2^5$. Then $Df=\begin{pmatrix}
  f_{x_1x_1} & f_{x_1x_2}  \\
  f_{x_2x_1} & f_{x_2x_2} 
 \end{pmatrix}$
But now I am stuck in proving the result. Am I in the correct track? Can anyone plese give me a hint to continue?
Ok so since $g\circ f$ is $0$, the image of $f$ is the line $x_1+x_2=0$ which has no min, max or saddle. 
If det$Df(x_0)>0$ and $f_{x_1x_1}(x_0)>0$ OR det$Df(x_0)>0$ and $f_{x_1x_1}(x_0)<0$, we have contradiction. 
But if det$Df(x_0)>0$ and $f_{x_1x_1}(x_0)=0$, then det$Df(x_0)=0$ or, det$Df(x_0)<0$(Since $f_{x_1x_2}=f_{x_2x_1}$). So this is impossible.
If det$Df(x

Q:

Can't write to console in async C# code when called from powershell ISE

I have a PowerShell script that needs to call C# to do work, some of it asynchronously.  While debugging some errors that only occur when the C# code is called from PowerShell, I noticed something I wasn't expecting.  In the C# code, if I made a call to Console.WriteLine it wrote to the PowerShell console as expected unless I was using PowerShell ISE and it was called after I did an await in an async function.
Here's a sample script that shows the issue:
$source = @"
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class TestClass
{   
    public static int TestWrapper()
    {
        var task = TestAsync();
        task.Wait();
        return task.Result;
    }

    private static async Task<int> TestAsync()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Before await");
        await Task.Run(() => { Thread.Sleep(2000); return; });
        Console.WriteLine("After await");
        return 2;
    }
}

"@

Add-Type -TypeDefinition $source
[TestClass]::TestWrapper()

In here, I'm just calling an asynchronous function, waiting for it to complete, and returning the result.  Inside the function, I just try to log before and after putting a thread to sleep for a few seconds before returning a value so that I know that the function fully executed.
I would expect to see:
Before await
After await
2

And that's what I see when running as a C# console application or in basic PowerShell, but when running through PowerShell ISE, I see:
Before await
2

Can anyone explain why that would be?

A:

PowerShell ISE use Console.SetOut with HostTextWriter to capture and print Console.WriteLine output on PowerShell ISE host window. And HostTextWriter redirect Console.WriteLine to PowerShell host only if host registered (HostTextWriter.RegisterHost) for current thread.
In absence of SynchronizationContext continuation caused by await keyword will be executed in arbitrary thread pool thread, which likely does not

t must be the time of your system/simulation. This will change everytime you call it.
b should be 0, the starting value.
c should be 10, the final value,
d should be 40000 (assuming your time is in milliseconds). This is essentially the duration. Each four second you want to advance by one unit which will take a total of 40 seconds.
You can test/play with it with a sample program:
float easeInOutSine(float t, float b, float c, float d)
{
    return -c/2 * (cos(M_PI*t/d) - 1) + b;
}

int main() {
    for (unsigned t = 0; t <= 40*1000; t += 1000) {
        cout << "t= " << t << " y=" << easeInOutSine(t, 0, 10, 40000) << std::endl;
    }
}

Output:
t= 0 y=0

Q:

LED mixing: 2 off-line drivers vs 1 powersupply + 2 buck converters

I want to drive two sets of 3 LEDs. They are all 35V but the two sets differ in color spectra and current: the first set needs 900mA the other 500mA.
I want to freely mix the two sets using PWM, so that the total power consumption always stays between 72W and 100W.
One easy way  to do this would be to connect each set in series and use two dimmable drivers (e.g. ELG-100-C).
But this seems to be quite a waste in terms of cost and size; and probably also efficiency considering one of the drivers might be much less utilized at any given time.
It seems to me a cleaner way is to use a 100W power supply and 2 buck converters.
But I have trouble finding an off the shelf constant current buck converter that supports PWM dimming and the 105V needed. Nor any reference design for such a thing.
Using boost converters seems to be more common - but this is likely to be less efficient. Another possibility around this would be to drive the sets in parallel and use a current mirror (or a more fancy LED balancer) - not sure how this fares efficiency wise.
My main questions are:

Is using 2 buck converters a good idea worth investigating further? (Any pointers would be nice!)
Is there another easy solution I'm missing?
Am I in way over my head? I had some EE classes during my Computer Engineering Bachelor, and now again skimmed Chapter 9 of the Art of Electronics. 

I am willing to dive into the material but want to avoid to find out I spent months working on an idea that was doomed from the start - because I won't be able to match (or exceed) the efficiency of two professional 100W LED drivers.

A:

The easy way is to use an HLG-40H-36B (750mA) and HLG-60H-36B (1.7A) at about $30 each.
Powering 2 buck drivers with a single supply is a very valid method.
I use a TI LM3414HV which is a simple inexpensive circuit.
But that's too much like work for a one shot deal.
You can use an eval board, from Infineon Technologies Part Number VALLEDILD6150TO

Let $F$ be the subset of $[0,1]$ constructed in the same manner as the Cantor set except that each of the intervals removed at $n$th iteration has a length $\frac{\alpha}{3^{n}}$ with $0<\alpha<1$ rather than $\frac{1}{3^{n}}$.
I've been told that on each iteration, each of the intervals removed has length $\frac{\alpha}{3^{n}}$, but that the total length of $F$ is $1-\alpha$. 
I'm trying to show this by taking the limit as $n \to \infty$ of the length of the intervals left behind at each iteration. For example, on the second iteration, the way I see it, two intervals of length $\frac{\alpha}{3^{2}}$ should be removed, so the length left behind would be $1-\frac{\alpha}{3} - \frac{2\alpha}{9} = 1-\frac{5\alpha}{3^{2}} = 1-\left(\alpha-\frac{2\alpha}{3}\right)$.
So, my question is, a I correct in assuming that after the $n$th iteration, what is left behind will be $1-\left(\alpha - \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{n}\right)$, which, as $n \to \infty$, converges to $1-\alpha$?

A:

At the first step, as you say, we are removing an interval of length $\frac{\alpha}{3}$. At the second step we are going to remove two intervals of length $\frac{\alpha}{3^2}$, for a total length of $\frac{2\alpha}{3^2}$.
In the same way, at the $n$-th step we will remove $2^{n-1}$ intervals of length $\frac{\alpha}{3^n}$, for a total length of $\frac{2^{n-1}\alpha}{3^n}$.
Now, to compute the total length of what's left behind, we can just compute the amount of length we removed and then subtract it from $1$.
To do so, we need to sum all the lengths of those intervals we have removed:
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2^{n-1}\alpha}{3^n}=\frac{\alpha}{3}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(\frac23

.
mylist[[4]]
mylist[[5]]

(* 31 *)
(* 31.5 *)

As expected 31 and 31.5 were found.
Let's do it for all the points, and have the result in a friendly and useful way : 
closePointsPositions = Table[i -> 
Flatten[Position[mylist, x_?(9 < # - mylist[[i]] < 11 & )]],
{i, Length[mylist]}] // DeleteCases[#, _ -> {}] &

(*{1 -> {4, 5}, 2 -> {6}, 4 -> {8, 9}, 5 -> {10}, 6 -> {10}, 10 -> {11}}*)

This is actually the solution of the problem but in a condensed form. It shows all the connections found, from which you can build the corresponding paths.
For example here : point 1 (21) of the list is within the required distance from point 4 (31.) and  from point 5 (31.5). Next, you see that point 4 (31.) is "connected" to the points 8 (40.1) and 9 (40.4). And so on.
How to extract from this result, the corresponding subsets of "connected" points ?
2. Graph approach
The problem really looks like a network problem so it is suitable to be examined with Graph-tools that Mathematica actually has built-in.
(Actually I am very bad at graph theory but this was time to explore) 
Let's slightly modify the previous result so it is compatible with graph tools : 
edges = Flatten[Thread /@ closePointsPositions]
{1 -> 4, 1 -> 5, 2 -> 6, 4 -> 8, 4 -> 9, 5 -> 10, 6 -> 10, 10 -> 11}

Let's visualize this as a graph :
mygraph = Graph[edges, VertexLabels -> "Name"]

For the labels, if instead of the positions of the points you want the positions values then :
vertexlist = Union[Flatten[edges /. Rule -> List]]
(*{1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11}*)

.
mygraph = Graph[edges,
VertexLabels -> (# -> NumberForm[mylist[[#]], {20, 1}] & )

Q:

Using APIs within Django and how to display the data

I am trying to test how to display API information within a view on my Django project. I know you may have to add some installed APIs into the settings INSTALLED APPS block. 
This api is a simple geo one. 
I am new to Django and new to using APIs within it. I have managed to get my app the way I need it using Youtube videos. But now I am on my own. I have many different view classes to display differents of my app. 
The view below is the view Id like to place the data on. 
is this how I would potentially do it? Then call {{ base }} within the HTHL to display it?
class PostDetailView(DetailView):
    model = Post
    template_name = 'clients/post_detail.html'

    def api_test(request):
        #  This is where the APIs are going to go.
        requests.get('https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json')
        data = response.json()
        return render(request, 'clients/post_detail.html', {
            'base': data['disclaimer']
        })

I am currently getting no errors within my app, but the country element isnt displaying.
I have tested the following in just a simple python file
import requests
import json

response = requests.get('https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json')
data = response.json()

print(data['disclaimer'])

which gets the desired result. So I guess now my issue is...how do i get this into the HTML? So i can display the results from the API

A:

You can write like this:
class PostDetailView(DetailView):
    model = Post
    template_name = 'clients/post_detail.html'

    def call_geo_api(self):
        #  This is where the APIs are going to go.
        response = requests.get('https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json')
        data = response.json()

A:

This is certainly possible.
To change the strategy for a single type (MyClass):
fixture.Customize<MyClass>(c => c.FromFactory(
    new MethodInvoker(
        new GreedyConstructorQuery())));

To change the strategy across the board:
fixture.Customizations.Add(
    new MethodInvoker(
        new GreedyConstructorQuery()));

As it turns out, however, using GreedyConstructorQuery across the board is most likely problematic, as the following code snippet demonstrates. Imagine a class with this constructor:
public Foo(string name)
{
    this.name = name;
}

This test will throw an exception:
[Test]
public void GreedyConstructor()
{
    Fixture fixture = new Fixture();
    fixture.Customizations.Add(new MethodInvoker(new GreedyConstructorQuery()));

    Foo foo = fixture.CreateAnonymous<Foo>();
}

The exception thrown is:

Ploeh.AutoFixture.ObjectCreationException : AutoFixture was unable to create an instance from System.SByte*, most likely because it has no public constructor, is an abstract or non-public type.

So what's that about the SByte*? There's no SByte* in Foo...
Well, yes there is. By placing the MethodInvoker in Customization, it overrides all default creation strategies, including the one for strings. Instead, it goes looking for the greediest constructor for string and that is:
public String(sbyte* value, int startIndex, int length, Encoding enc);

And there's the sbyte*...

It's still possible to replace the modest constructor selection algorithm with a greedy algorithm, it's just a tad more involved than I first realized.
What you can do is this:
Write a small class like this one:
public class GreedyEngineParts : DefaultEngineParts
{
    public override IEnumerator<ISpecimenBuilder> GetEnumerator()
    {
        var iter = base.GetEnumerator();
        while (iter.MoveNext())
        {
            if (iter.Current is MethodInvoker)
                yield return new MethodInvoker(
                    new CompositeMethodQuery(
                        new GreedyConstructorQuery(),
                        new FactoryMethodQuery

I see that clip is now depreciated, so I am attempting to use clip-path. What is clip-path's equivalent?
Is it:
clip-path: inset(0 0 0 0);

A:

No, it is not inset(0 0 0 0). The old clip property's parameters specify the distance at which the clipped rect's corners should be located from (0,0) of the box whereas in new clip-path: inset() they are points from the top, from right, from bottom and from left. 
So, rect(0 0 0 0) means all four corners of the clipped rect are at (0,0). Whereas inset(0 0 0 0) would mean the clipped rect's four corners are at (0,0) (100,0) (100,100) (0,100) for a 100px x 100px box. To put simply, clip: rect(0 0 0 0) is clip everything while clip-path: inset(0 0 0 0) is clip nothing.
Similarly, clip: rect(0 10px 10px 0) would produce a 10px x 10px box and its equivalent in the new syntax would be clip: inset(0 90px 90px 0) (if the un-clipped box is 100px by 100px).
(Note: Just for clarification, non Webkit/Blink browsers do not support CSS clip-path fully as yet and so the snippet will not work as expected in those browsers.)

div {
  position: absolute;
  height: 100px;
  width: 100px;
  background: yellowgreen;

Q:

Disconnect circuit after primary circuit detects high volume

I would like to build a circuit that detects high volume (through a microphone or something) and when it does, it would disconnect another circuit from its power source.
I don't know exactly how high the volume threshold should be yet.
It's a small project I'm working on and I don't have much experience using electronics.
How might I go about doing this?
EDIT: I want the sound that my circuit to detect an instantaneously high volume of a song that is emitted from a stereo. The circuit it shuts down is an electrical device that uses 220 volts, it will be connected to its power cord. 

A:

Volume, or in this case, audio amplitude or sound pressure, is a dynamic/variable thing. In other words, it will vary based on location and position of microphone, frequency and duration of the source audio, etc.
A little something to think about: When you watch a documentary video with a narrator and background music, there is often an audio effect called ducking going on. The narrator speaks, and the amplitude of the music  goes down. When the narrator stops, the music becomes gradually louder again. In the small quiet gaps between words, however, the music doesn't become loud, so how does it know when the narrator is done?
When you apply a ducking effect, you set a few parameters to avoid having the background music try to be loud during every possible quiet gap. One of these is a delay: "Wait 1500 ms after detecting x amplitude to return to normal music volume."
When you think about having a circuit detect sound pressure, you have to ask whether you are interested in an average or an instantaneous measurement. A sound pressure meter, like this one you can get from Radio Shack, has both of these modes. You might want to experiment to see what you need for your application. If you use an instantaneous measurement, or a max threshold, you might set off your detection circuit by clapping your hands, when in fact you'd prefer it only be triggered by more continuous loud noise.
Your circuit would need to take multiple readings from the microphone input (analog to digital conversion (ADC)) and determine whether they constitute a trigger event or not. For example, you might read the value ten times per second, and average them. You might take readings for a few seconds instead; it depends on how long you require the sound pressure to be

I'm trying to compare two strings (one from my database and another supplied by the user) and see if they match! The problem I'm having is that they don't seem to match - even though the strings seems to be exactly identical?
My PHP code is below:
public function Verify($pdo, $id, $token) {
    $prepsql = $pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM Profiles WHERE id = '$id' LIMIT 1");
    $prepsql->execute();
    $currentrow = $prepsql->fetch();
    $current = preg_replace("/[^a-zA-Z0-9]+/", "", $currentrow["token"]);
    echo '<p>'.var_dump($current).'</p>';
    echo '<p>'.var_dump($token).'</p>';
    $token = preg_replace("/[^a-zA-Z0-9]+/", "", $token);
    if ($current == null || $current = "") {
        return false;
    } else {
        if (strcmp($token, $current) == 0) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }

Okay, viewing affine spaces (in the manner of (2)) as sets equipped with affine combination functions, we get a forgetful functor $U_\mathbf{Aff} : \mathbf{Vect} \rightarrow \mathbf{Aff}$ that forgets the non-affine combinations, which is faithful but not full. And viewing affine spaces (in the manner of (1)) as sets equipped with the regular action of a vector space, we get a forgetful functor $U_\mathbf{Vect} : \mathbf{Aff} \rightarrow \mathbf{Vect}$ that forgets everything but the vector space, which is full but not faithful.
There's something bugging me about this situation. I think that $U_\mathrm{Vect} \circ U_\mathrm{Aff}$ is isomorphic to $\mathrm{id}_\mathbf{Vect}$. However, this would imply that $U_\mathrm{Aff} \circ U_\mathrm{Vect}$ is not isomorphic to $\mathrm{id}_\mathbf{Aff}.$ Okay, so what on earth does $U_\mathrm{Aff} \circ U_\mathrm{Vect}$ look like? Clearly both $U_\mathrm{Aff}$ and $U_\mathrm{Vect}$ are essentially bijective on objects. So $U_\mathrm{Aff} \circ U_\mathrm{Vect} : \mathbf{Aff} \rightarrow \mathbf{Aff}$ is either non-full, or non-faithful.
I think that it is neither full nor faithful. Is this correct? If so, I find the non-fullness difficult to stomach and/or comprehend. It means that for no apparent reason, certain affine transforms arbitrarily fail to be obtainable from linear transforms under this functor. Well, which ones are they?
Guys, help me out here. What's up with the endofunctor $U_\mathrm{Aff} \circ U_\mathrm{Vect} : \mathbf{Aff} \rightarrow \mathbf{Aff}$?

A:

I work with definition (1) only. The "forgetful" functor $\mathbf{Vect} \to \mathbf{Aff}$ is the one sending a vector space $V$ to $(V, V)$, where $V$ acts on itself by translation. Thus the composite $\mathbf{Vect} \to \mathbf{Aff} \to \mathbf{Vect}$ is indeed the identity.

Android won't save data entered to the SQLite database

I am creating an app which manages ingredients. I want to create an SQLite database which will save all the ingredients which a user enters when they click the save button. However, for some reason my data won't save to the SQLite database. I cannot see what is wrong with the code at all.
DatabaseHelper.java
public class DatabaseHelper extends SQLiteOpenHelper
{
    private static final String tag = "Database Helper";
    private static final String TABLE_NAME = "products_registered";
    private static final String col1 = "Name";

Javascript: Making a textbox display if a dropdown option is selected

Here's a screenshot of what I'm trying to accomplish:

Basically, if the user chooses "SFTP", a textbox should be displayed.
Here's the code I have:
<strong class="heading">Image Hosting</strong>
<div id="imagehosting">
    <form name="test">
        Does the client require our company to host their images? <br />
        <em>If you select this option, you'll have to specify what they will be using</em>
        <input type="checkbox" name="category_level" onchange="categorychanged(this.checked)" />

        <select name="category_parent" style="display:none" onchange="if(this.selectedIndex==SFTP){this.form['box'].style.visibility='visible'}else {this.form['box'].style.visibility='hidden'};">
            <option value="1">Library</option>
            <option value="2">SFTP</option>
        </select>
        <input style="visibility:hidden;" type="text" name="box">
    </form>
<br />
</div>

The function, "categorychanged", is handled by the following Javascript code:
<script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">
<!--
function categorychanged(enable) 
{
    if (enable) 
    {
        document.test.category_parent.style.display="block";
    }
    else 
    {
        document.test.category_parent.style.display="none";
    }
}
//-->
</script>

Right now, if I choose "SFTP", nothing happens. The first part works fine, i.e. dropdown displayed when the checkbox is selected.
What am I doing wrong here?
Thanks

A:

So, here's a fiddle with working code. The issue is the value you are checking against.
this.selectedIndex

can be just
this.value

But your code could also use some clean up. First off, unless you have some reason you are not doing so, I'd recommend a library like Prototype.js or jQuery. That's going to make your job a lot easier. I would also

I am building a Video service using Azure Media Services and Node.js
Everything went semi-fine till now, however when I tried to deploy the app to Azure Web Apps for hosting, any large files fail with 404.13 error. 
Yes I know about maxAllowedContentLength and not, that is NOT a solution. It only goes up to 4GB, which is pathetic - even HDR environment maps can easily exceed that amount these days. I need to enable users to upload files up to 150GB in size. However when azure web apps recieves a multipart request it appears to buffer it into memory until a certain threshold of either bytes or just seconds (upon hitting which, it returns me a 404.13 or a 502 if my connection is slow) BEFORE running any of my server logic. 
I tried Transfer-Encoding: chunked header in the server code, but even if that would help, since Web Apps doesn't let the code run, that doesn't actually matter.
For the record: I am using Sails.js at backend and Skipper is handling the stream piping to Azure Blob Service. Localhost obviously works just fine regardless of file size. I made a duplicate of this question on MSDN forums, but those are as slow as always. You can go there to see what I have found so far: enter link description here
Clientside I am using Ajax FormData to serialize the fields (one text field and one file) and send them, using the progress even to track upload progress.
Is there ANY way to make this work? I just want it to let my serverside logic handle the data stream, without buffering the bloody thing.

A:

Rather than running all this data through your web application, you would be better off having your clients upload directly to a container in your Azure blob storage account.
You will need to enable CORS on your Azure Storage account to support this.  Then, in your web application, when a user needs to upload data you would instead generate a SAS token for the storage account container you want the client to upload to and return that to the client.  The client would then use the SAS token to upload the file into your storage account.
On the back-end, you could fire off a web job to do whatever processing you need to do on the file after it's been uploaded.
Further details and sample ajax code to do this is available in this blog post from

Dim con As New SqlConnection(ConStr)

con.Open()

'Retrieve the FilePath() of the image file

Dim sqlCommand As New SqlCommand()

sqlCommand.Connection = con

sqlCommand.CommandText = "SELECT ItemImage.PathName() AS PathName " + _

                     "FROM items WHERE ItemNumber = 'MS1001'"

Dim filePath As String = sqlCommand.ExecuteScalar()

'Obtain a Transaction Context

Dim transaction As SqlTransaction = con.BeginTransaction("ItemTran")

sqlCommand.Transaction = transaction

sqlCommand.CommandText = "SELECT GET_FILESTREAM_TRANSACTION_CONTEXT()"

Dim txContext As Byte() = sqlCommand.ExecuteScalar()

' Open and read file using SqlFileStream Class

Dim sqlFileStream As New SqlFileStream(filePath, txContext, FileAccess.Read)

Dim buffer As Byte() = New Byte(sqlFileStream.Length) {}

sqlFileStream.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length)

'Bind the image data to an image control

Dim ms As MemoryStream = New MemoryStream(buffer)

Dim bmp As Bitmap = New Bitmap(ms)

ItemImage.Image = bmp

'Cleanup

sqlFileStream.Close()

sqlCommand.Transaction.Commit()

I was not able to transform this in classic asp but in the same article I have read something more frustrating:

When accessing FILESTREAM data using TSQL, SQL Server reads the content of the >FILESTREAM data file and serves it to the client. SQL Server memory is used for reading >the content of the data file. Accessing FILESTREAM data using Win32 Streaming does not >use SQL Server memory. In addition it allows the application to take advantage of the >Streaming capabilities of the NT File System. 

So what is my real problem?
Can be the vb.net code transform and used in a classic asp?And if it can, does that mean that when I am using the "file-stream" enable futures and want to display data in the web it will be more slow then using desktop application?
I am pretty confused and will appreciate any answer or link with article to read.

A little confused on

I am trying to make underscores (_) appear in my output while using ODS Tagsets but for some unknown reasons it's not appearing as expected. I'm using SAS 9.4.
It appears with Bodytitle and Bodytitle_aux but the pagebreaking is much better with Tagsets.
Unfortunately using unicode doesn't work either. 
Here is a sample code:

options nonumber; 
%let path=;
ods path(prepend) work.templat(update);
proc template ;
define style newstyle ;
  parent = styles.journal ;
  class Parskip /
      font = fonts("headingFont")
      cellpadding = 0 cellspacing = 0  /* Only for Measured */
      frame= void
      Rules = NONE
      BorderWidth = 0
      Color = _undef_
      BackGroundColor = _undef_;
  style byline                          / font_face="Courier New"  font_style=Roman background = white;
  style Body from Document              / font_face="Courier New" font_style=Roman background = white;
 style data                            / font_face="Courier New" font_style=Roman  ;
  style table                           / font_face="Courier New" font_style=Roman 
                                      bordercolor=black background = white borderwidth=1 ;
 style cellcontents                    / font_face="Courier New" font_style=Roman  ;
  style TitleAndNoteContainer           / font_face="Courier New" font_style=Roman  background = white;
  style ProcTitle                       / font_face="Courier New" font_style=Roman  ;
  style systemtitle                      / font_face="Courier New" font_style=Roman  ;
  style rowheader from headersandfooters / font_face="Courier New" font_style=Roman  ;
  style BodyDate                         / font_face="Courier New" font_style=Roman  ;
  style PageNo                           / font_face="Courier New" font_style=Roman ;

So I have a page that upon an action needs multiple ajax calls. The angular dataService.getData is called which uses $q/deferred like so:
return {
    getData: function(obj) {
        var def = $q.defer();

        $http({
            url: obj.url,
            method: "GET",
            headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }
        }).then(function(data) {
              if (data.data) {
                  def.resolve({
                     response: data 
                  })
              }
        })
        return def.promise;
    }
}

at one point I need to call a few individual requests on a group of items from the controller:
$scope.goGetEmBoys = function(group) {
    config.group.forEach(function(d) {
         if(d.name == group) {
             dataService.getData({url: d.urlToCall})
                 .then(function(data){
                       // use each with its own registered callback
                       d.callback(data);
                 })
         }
    })
}

What I want to do is have a bitValue to toggle when requests are working and when completed, even if I have to store something like $scope.somethingIsHappening = 0, etc
I think wrapping it in the $.when deferred reads like a reasonable approach but I have been unable to get that working, also is there a better approach to this versus trying to fit the call (goGetEmBoys function and ultimately the loop) inside a deferred like this?
tried the call to the scope function, as well as the block within it inside a jquery when....I must be using it wrong. Any advice is welcome.

A:

I don't know I fully understood what do you want to achieve - you want to know when all request are completed? If length of group does not change, you may try the following:
$scope.areReqestsFinished = false;
$scope.goGetEmBoys = function(group) {
    var counter = 0;
    config.group.forEach(function(d) {
         if(d.name == group) {
             dataService.getData({url: d.urlToCall})
                 

You can use Zend_Config_Ini
$config = new Zend_Config_Ini('my/ini/file.ini');
echo $config->conditions->time; // 50

A:

The Application's Bootstrap.php has access to the application.ini using $this->getOptions(), you could store the value you want in your registry something like this:
  public function _initConditions()
  {
    $config = $this->getOptions();

    if (isset($config['conditions']))
    {

      $registry = Zend_Registry::getInstance();

      $registry->conditions = $config['conditions'];

    }
  }

You could then access your conditions using the registry, in much the same way that you set them here.

A:

Here is my approach, which you can use anywhere in the application:
class My_Controller_Action_Helper_Options extends Zend_Controller_Action_Helper_Abstract
{
    /**
     * Options separator delimiterm e.g.
     * option.subkey or
     * option/subkey

    const DELIMITER = '.';

    /**
     * Retrieve application options from bootstrap
     * 
     * @return array
     */
    public function getOptions()
    {
        $front = $this->getFrontController();
        $bootstrap = $front->getParam('bootstrap');
        if (null === $bootstrap) {
            throw new Exception('Unable to find bootstrap');
        }

        return $bootstrap->getOptions();
    }

    /**
     * Get array key if exists, otherwise returns null
     * 
     * @param array $values
     * @param string $key
     * @return mixed

    private static function _getValue($values, $key) 
    {   
        if (is_array($values) && isset($values[$key])) {

            return $values[$key];  
        } 

        return null;
    }

    /**

On functors which are generically representable

Let $F$ be a set-valued (contravariant) functor on the category of schemes. Let $F_{\mathbb Q}$ be the associated functor on the category of schemes over $\mathbb Q$.
Suppose that $F_{\mathbb Q}$ is representable by a scheme (over $\mathbb Q$). Does it follow that $F_{\mathbb Z[1/n]}$ is representable for some large integer $n$? (No.)
I can easily imagine cases this could fail to be the case.
I'm actually wondering what the minimal hypothesis is on $F$ for the answer to be positive. For instance, what if we assume $F$ is a sheaf in the etale topology? 

A:

Being a sheaf in the étale topology is insufficient.  Begin with the locally ringed space $(\text{Spec}\mathbb{Z},\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}\mathbb{Z}})$.  Let $$i:X\hookrightarrow \text{Spec}\mathbb{Z}$$ 
be the complement of the generic point $\langle 0 \rangle$.  Give $X$ the sheaf of rings $\mathcal{O}_X := i^{-1}\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}\mathbb{Z}}$.  Let $$i^\#:\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}\mathbb{Z}} \to i_*\mathcal{O}_X,$$
be the natural map defined by adjunction of $i^{-1}$ and $i_*$.  Then $(i,i^\#)$ is a morphism of locally ringed spaces.  Moreover, $(i,i^\#)$ has the following universal property: for every locally ringed space $(T,\mathcal{O}_T)$ and for every morphism of locally ringed spaces
$$ (f,f^\#):(T,\mathcal{O}_T) \to (\text{Spec}\mathbb{Z},\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}\mathbb{Z}}),$$
(of course there is a unique such morphism!), there exists a morphism of locally ringed spaces
$$ (g,g^\#):(T,\mathcal{O}_T) \to (X,\mathcal{O}_X),$$
with $(i,i^\#)\circ(g,g^\#) = (f,f^\#)$ if and only if $g(T)$ is contained in $i(X)$, in which case the morphism

In view I just try to show the content from devices (<%- devices -%>), which I know it'll be something like this:
[ [ [Object],
      [Object],
      [Object],
      ........

but it says "devices is not defined".. and I don't know why. 
Also if there is a solution on how to do that without breaking the code in multiple functions that'll be cool.

Let's forget about the ap_p promise for now.
This are the promises functions:
       const switch_p = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
            conn.query('SELECT * FROM switch', (err, switch_data) => {
                if (err) reject(err)
                else resolve(switch_data);
            });
        });

       const server_p = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
            conn.query('SELECT * FROM server', (err, server_data) => {
                if (err) reject(err)
                else resolve(server_data);
            });
        });

      const router_p = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
            conn.query('SELECT * FROM router', (err, router_data) => {
                if (err) reject(err)
                else resolve(router_data);

And the promise all function, although I don't know if I handled the error in a good way..
Promise.all([switch_p, server_p, router_p]).then(responses => {
            console.log(responses);
            res.render('admin-panel', {
                'layout': 'layoutAdmin',
                'locals': {'_id': sess_id, 'uname': sess_uname, 'rol': sess_rol, 'devices': responses}

        })
            .catch(function (error) {
                console.log(error);
                throw (error);
            });

Q:

nested select in mysqlite

I am learning sqlite using the example from sqldf, I have come across example 3 about nested select and I don't quite understand the code:
sqldf("select iris.Species '[Species]',
              avg(Sepal_Length) '[Avg of SLs > avg SL]'
       from iris,
         (select Species, avg(Sepal_Length) SLavg
          from iris group by Species) SLavg
       where iris.Species = SLavg.Species
          and Sepal_Length > SLavg
       group by iris.Species")

I think the code above is trying to:

create a table with [Species] and [Avg of SLs > avg SL] using data from iris (from line 1-3)
create a table named SLavg with Species and average Sepal_Length for each Species from iris (from line 4-6)

I wonder why SLavg is present in line 4-5 for 2 times, I tried removing SLavg and sqldf gives me statement: no such column: SLavg and statement: no such column: SLavg.Species.

A:

The code queries two columns from cross-join of two tables:
select c1,c2 from iris,T2 where .... group by ....

Where T2 is a subquery which is given shorthand 'SLavg':
select d1, d2 from iris group by ...... // subquery

SLavg is used for both subquery name and column name, and that's confusing. Let's give them different names:
select 
    iris.Species '[Species]', avg(Sepal_Length) '[Avg of SLs > avg SL]'
from 
    iris, 
    (select Species, avg(Sepal_Length) AVGcol from iris group by Species) AVGtbl
where 
    iris.Species = AVGtbl.Species and Sepal_Length > AVGcol
group by 
    iris.Species

Now it should be more understandable: 

the subquery AVGtbl produces two columns (Species, AVGcol)
the cross-join of iris and AVGtbl produces four columns (

A:

Yes.  You do need to change swappiness to increase SSD life.
Swappiness lets you control how much swap file is being used. Swappiness values can be changed from 0 to 100. The higher swappiness values the more the kernel will try to use swap space, the lower swappiness values means the kernel will use less or no swap space depending on our setting. 
The default swappiness value from is 60, if you have plenty have RAM, you should avoid using swap space which writes and reads to your SSD, but to an HDD. For system with 4 GB or more RAM, try to reduce the usage of swap by changing swappiness settings to between 10 even 0, with the swap file being on an HDD.
Running a swap space is very disk I/O intensive, and that’s actually bad for an SSD. An SSD can only handle so many writes before it goes bad and you’re forced to buy another drive. So, if at all possible, move your swap space to a secondary, spinning drive…away from the SSD. 
A Solid State Drive is worn down relatively quickly by write actions. Especially the oldest generations of SSD's were vulnerable in that aspect, but to a lesser degree that's still the case for the newer generations.
You can either make a new partition on a new disk, or just make a swap file instead; making a new partition will almost always result in much better performance.
If you don’t have an alternate drive to move to, you can alter a setting that will only enable swap when your physical RAM is 100% full, which will decrease the load on your swapfile, and help your SSD. Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:
echo 0 > /proc/sys/vm/swappiness

SSD wear and tear has to do with write cycles
A Solid State Drive is worn down relatively quickly by write actions. Especially the oldest generations of SSD's were vulnerable in that aspect, but to a lesser degree that's still the case for the newer generations.
Use Trim
TRIM is an advantage that you use with SSDs. It runs in software and communicates with the SSD controller, telling it which ‘blocks’ are no longer needed by the filesystem and can be safely cleaned and overwritten. This won’t really result in an improvement of performance

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Working on my router, so only 60mb free ram.
I welcome answers in bash, but sh would make my day.
If there is a binary that does this, i don't mind compiling it to run on my router.  
TL;DR
I have a directory with text files.
How can i make sure that, between all files, i do not have repeated lines?
For example, if a.txt, b.txt and c.txt contains the line apple, it should remain only in one of them (doesn't matter which one).
IF YOU WANT DETAILS
I have a script downloading multiple hosts files in the same directory, used by dnsmasq.
I do not want to merge all files into one, but keep them all deleting the repeated hostnames.
For example, in
y.txt

127.0.0.1    google.com
127.0.0.1    yahoo.com

and
z.txt

0.0.0.0    apple.com
0.0.0.0    yahoo.com

the line containing the domain yahoo.com should be deleted from one of them.
if this line also exists in another file, should be deleted from it as well.
WHAT I HAVE TRIED
1- concatenating all files into one, sorting and keeping only unique lines.
having only one big file is not the ideal solution here.
2- iterating over the files, comparing each one with the remaining.
saving the result in a temporary file, sorting, removing duplicated lines and finally renaming the temp file to replace the original.
seems like i'm wasting resources here.

A:

You can do what you are attempting to do fairly easily using sed and a temporary file. Simply copy one of the file (e.g z.txt) to a temp file. Then read each line in the other file (e.g. y.txt) and separate into ip and host. Then call sed -i to edit the temp file in place deleting any line with a matching $host name. When you are done, replace z.txt with the temp file. 
For example:
cp -a z.txt z.tmp                   ## copy z.txt to temp file
while read -r ip host; do           ## read each line in y.txt
    sed -

Say I have a rewrite that needs to pass the url to a PHP function and retrieve a value in order to tell what the new destination should be?  is there a way to do that?
Thanks.
UPDATE:
Thanks so far guys..I am still having trouble but i'll show you my code:
.htaccess
#I got the file path by echoing DOCUMENT_ROOT and added the rest.
RewriteMap fixurl prg:/var/www/vhosts/mydomain.com/httpsdocs/domain_prototype/code_base/url_handler.php

RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule (.*) ${fixurl:$1} [PT]

PHP:
set_time_limit(0); # forever program!
$keyboard = fopen("php://stdin","r");
while (1) {
        $line = trim(fgets($keyboard));
        print "www.google.com\n";  # <-- just test to see if working.
}

However I am getting a 500 Internal Server Error I am not sure if there is an error in my .htaccess or in my PHP?

A:

There is something called a RewriteMap.
You can call an executable script that will return the URL to rewrite to.
Check this article for more information and examples (in Perl, but are totally applicable to any other language):
http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/apache/2005/04/28/apacheckbk.html
Summary of caveats:

Must run a read STDIN loop (ie, don't exit after receiving an URL)
Must print the URL to rewrite to WITH a trailing newline
Must be readable and executable by the user Apache runs as

This is the way to create the map
RewriteMap fixurl prg:/usr/local/scripts/fixit.php

And now we can use it in a RewriteRule:
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule (.*) ${fixurl:$1} 

EDIT: About the Internal Server Error. The most probable cause is what Gumbo mentions, RewriteMap cannot be used in .htaccess, sadly. You can use it in a RewriteRule in .htaccess, but can only create it in server config or virtual host config. To be certain, check the error log.

I am trying to understand variable_get(). I read so far that you can set variables in the settings.php using the $conf array and retrieve them later in code by using variable_get(). I have read that you can also use variable_get() to retrieve values from the database. 
How does this work?
Is there a table that is automatically built?
How would you set variables if this feature is possible?  

A:

Maybe you hope to learn that variable_set is the magical way to store all kinds of structured data in your database, and that variable_get is the way to get it out again. Unfortunately, it is not.
The "persistent variables", as they are often called, are meant for relatively simple key-value pairs that should persist across requests, users and sessions, often until a site admin changes the value. A good example is the site name.
So how does it work?
When Drupal is bootstrapped, all variables are read from the cache (if available) or from the variables table. (See variable_initialize for the exact code.) The variables and stored in the global $conf variable, a huge array. Drupal does this because it's more efficient than doing a database query every time a variable is needed. (It's also the reason why variable_set is not suitable for large blobs of data: they would be loaded on every request!)
Whenever you use variable_get('variable_name', 'default_value'), the variable name is looked up in the $conf array. If it exists, the value is returned; else, the default value is returned.
Finally, there is a third member of the family: variable_del. As the name implies, this deletes a variable from the variables table. This function is often used in hook_uninstall implementations, deleting variables when a module is uninstalled.
If you are looking for ways to store more complex custom data structures in the database, check out hook_schema and drupal_write_record, or use the Drupal entity system and Entity API.

A:

If you are using Drush (strongly recommended), you can issue drush vget > variables.txt from the command line to create a text file with a list of all current variables and their values.  Similarly, you can use drush vset to change set any variable to a different value. 
See GitHub for more details about variable

Negative numbers not indexed numbers without negative symbol in full text catalog

I store a docx file in sql server database that contains negative number like -56653. 
I installed Microsoft Filter Pack 2.0 and execute this code:
EXEC sp_fulltext_service 'update_languages'; 
EXEC sp_fulltext_service 'load_os_resources', 1;
EXEC sp_fulltext_service 'restart_all_fdhosts'; 

Then rebuild the Full Text Catalog multiple time, When search 56653, the query not found any things, but when search -56653 the query work fine.
SELECT *
FROM Files
WHERE
   (CONTAINS([Files].[Content], '"56653"'))

As far as I know, this can only be solved if you nest the two <div class="box2"> inside of a <div class="box"> wrapper

.container {

.box {

  <div class="box"></div>
  <div class="box">

Another solution (but more a hack for this case than a generic solution) is to keep all what you have and adjust margin of last element.
Of course the margin-top value will depend on ther other values

.container {

  flex-flow: row wrap;
}
.box {
  width: 50%;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: lightgreen;
}

  height: 25px;
  background-color: red;
}
.box2:last-child {
  margin-left:auto;
  margin-top:-

However, the solution returned only has 1 integration constant, c_1, rather than the 2 I expected (i.e., an initial condition and a boundary condition). Thus, when I attempt the next step to apply the conditions I can only apply one, leading to an erroneous/incomplete solution.
Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. Using v11.2.
Update
Apparently c_1 is really a function and not a constant. In that case I am still left wondering how to proceed. There is a soluction when solving for IC OR BC but not both. Ideas/tricks on how to proceed?

A:

With the exception of the main function, any function that is defined to return a value must do so.  If it does not, and the calling function attempts to use the returned value, you invoked undefined behavior.  
This is specified in section 6.9.1p12 of the C standard:

If the } that terminates a function is reached, and the value of the
  function call is used by the caller, the behavior is undefined.

In this case, you got "lucky" that the program happened to work, but there's no guarantee that will always be the case.  A seemingly unrelated change to your program can change how undefined behavior will manifest itself.

A:

Technically undefined behavior.
If this is x86 Intel, what is likely happening is that the math operations performed prior to returning from the function are just happening to be leaving the intended return value in the EAX register.  And for functions that return integers, the EAX register is also how the return value gets passed back to the caller.
Tail end of your calc function has generated assembly that looks like this:
    int res = 0;
 mov         dword ptr [res],0  
    if (operation[op_index] == '+')
 mov         eax,dword ptr [operation]  
 add         eax,dword ptr [op_index]    // MATH OPERATION WINDS UP IN EAX REGISTER
 movsx       ecx,byte ptr [eax]  
 cmp         ecx,2Bh  
 jne         calc+149h (05719F9h)  

And invoking code like this:
int x;
x = calc((char*)"4+5");
printf("%d\n", x);

Generated assembly is this
    x = calc((char*)"4+5");
 push        offset string "4+5" (0E87B30h)  
 call        _calc (0E8128Ah)  
 add         esp,4  
 mov         dword ptr [x],eax   // TAKE EAX AS RESULT OF FUNCTION AND ASSIGN TO X

But the moment I switch the project settings from debug build to optimized retail, all bets are off.  The compiler and linker will start inlining assembly, making crazy optimizations, etc... and it will even

how can I get on('click') to reset to the onload state after the click without a page refresh?

I have a textbox where the user inputs a location name then click a button to check availability. On the on('click') event handler the script uses post() to verify the availability then show if it is available or not to the user and then fades out.
Everything works fine. However, if the user attempts to make a change for whatever reason like a typo, nothing happens. How can I get on('click') to reset to the onload state after the click without a page refresh?
I have tried several different things but can't seem to get it. Being new to jquery I am not sure what I am leaving out.
Here is my code:
 $('#ckAval').on('click', function() {
        var locName = $('#locName').val();
        var url = $('#locNameVal').val();
        var postit = $.post( url, { locName:locName } );        
        postit.done(function( data ) {$( "#ckLocName" ).html( data ).delay( 300  ).fadeOut( "slow");})          
    });

HTML:
<div class="small-9 columns">
    <input type="text"  id="locName" name="location_name" placeholder="Enter Unique Location Name here..." value="'.$location_name.'" />
    <input type="hidden" id="locNameVal" value="'.$p_queries.'unique-location-name-query.php">
</div>

<div id="ckAval" class="small-3 columns">
    <span class="postfix">Check Availability</span>
</div>

<div id="ckLocName" class="text-center"></div>

Thank you in advance for your assistance:

A:

The issue is that fadeOut has the effect of hiding the element, so the second time you try to put content in that element its invisible. 
I have reproduced the issue below (click the button and a message is shown, click it again and it looks like the message is not working anymore - but the problem is the element is hidden)
Try it: http://jsfiddle.net/ezxmnb6e/
This can be fixed

Q:

How to get the expired candidates in MySQL

I am having a table with the columns for expired_date and registered_date. 
Expired date have set for 2 days to registered date. 
Its look like this: 
+--------------+--------------+---------------------+
| candidate_id | date_expires | date_added          |
+--------------+--------------+---------------------+
|            1 | 2016-03-26   | 2016-03-24 14:42:18 |
|            2 | 2016-03-23   | 2016-03-21 15:43:40 |
|            3 | 2016-02-15   | 2016-02-13 14:53:30 |
|            4 | 2016-02-22   | 2016-02-20 14:54:19 |
+--------------+--------------+---------------------+ 

My question is, I want to select expired profile to current date and time. 
This is how I tried it, but it doesn't work. 
SELECT * FROM candidates WHERE date_added = DATE_ADD(date_added, INTERVAL 2 DAY); 

Hope somebody may help me out. 
Thank you. 

A:

You may try any of the following query which meets your need.
SELECT 
*
FROM candidates
WHERE date_expires < CURDATE();

Or if you want to get the expired accounts with respect to date_added field then follow the query given below:
SELECT 
*
FROM candidates
WHERE DATE_ADD(date_added, INTERVAL 2 DAY) < CURDATE();

EDIT:
For fine-grained comparison you may use the following query:
SELECT 
*
FROM candidates
WHERE TIMESTAMPADD(DAY,2,date_added) < NOW();

Note: Actually you don't need to store the expired dates in database. Rather you can store the profile life time (in this case it is 2 Days) in database if this profile life time varies across different accounts. You don't need to store this in database if it's constant in nature (i.e. Always 2 DAYS).
So if you want to bring this change in your table structure then it would look like below:
+--------------+--------------+---------------------+
| candidate_id | days         | date_added          |
+--------------+--------------+---------------------+

Is this doable / feasible? Is it possible for the framework to create the necessary auth cookie without the plaintext password? And how would I do this?
SOLUTION:
This ended being the correct solution:
    public ActionResult ActiveDirectoryLogin(LoginModel model, string returnUrl)
    {
        if (ModelState.IsValid)
        {
            try
            {
                DirectoryEntry entry = new DirectoryEntry("LDAP://DC=MyIntranet,DC=MyCompany,DC=com", model.UserName, model.Password);
                object NativeObject = entry.NativeObject;

                var internalUser = db.UserProfiles.Where(x => x.ActiveDirectoryID == model.UserName).SingleOrDefault();

                if (internalUser != null)
                {
                    FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookie(internalUser.UserName, model.RememberMe);
                    return RedirectToLocal(returnUrl);
                }
            }
            catch (DirectoryServicesCOMException)
            {
                // No user existed with the given credentials
            }
            catch (InvalidOperationException)
            {
                // Multiple users existed with the same ActiveDirectoryID in the database. This should never happen!
            }
        }

        return RedirectToAction("Login");
    }

A:

This is all that the Websecurity.Login method does:
public static bool Login(string userName, string password, bool persistCookie = false)
{
    WebSecurity.VerifyProvider();
    bool flag = Membership.ValidateUser(userName, password);
    if (flag)
    {
        FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookie(userName, persistCookie);
    }
    return flag;
}

You can write your own method that authenticates against AD and then looks up the user name and the does sets the auth cookie something like:
public static bool MyLogin(string userName, string password, bool persistCookie = false)
{
    bool flag = CheckADUser(userName, password);

    if (flag)
    {
        string mappedUsername = GetMappedUser(userName);
        if(mappedUsername != "")
        {
            FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookie(userName, persistCookie);
        }
        else
        {

i have a very simple app that sends Absent/Present to Firestore and the label changes to what is sent to the server.
the UILabel is inside a UIView and i would like to change the color of the view to red when the label displays absent, green when present is displayed. 
How can i do this ?
@IBOutlet weak var p1ViewColor: UIView!
@IBOutlet weak var p1Label: UILabel!
@IBOutlet weak var p1ABTF: UITextField!
@IBOutlet weak var p1PRTF: UITextField!

// fetch data and display it
override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
    super.viewWillAppear(animated)
    pListener = docRef.addSnapshotListener { (docSnapshot, error ) in
        guard let docSnapshot = docSnapshot, docSnapshot.exists else { return }
        let myData = docSnapshot.data()
        let absent1 = myData?["Absent"] as? String ?? ""
        let present1 = myData?["Present"] as? String ?? ""
        self.p1Label.text = "\(absent1) \(present1)"

    }
}

A:

You could simply set p1ViewColor.backgroundColor = UIColor.red for instance 
But first of all you should re-design your data structure, that is why you are struggling.
As far as I understand, there can be two states Present and Absent, and this can be achieve with a simple Bool in your docSnapshot. Imagine there were a simple variable, called "Present" which is true if present and false if absent, your code could look like this : 
override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
    super.viewWillAppear(animated)
    pListener = docRef.addSnapshotListener { (docSnapshot, error ) in
        guard let docSnapshot = docSnapshot, docSnapshot.exists else { return }
        guard let myData = docSnapshot.data() else { return }

        let present: Bool = myData["Present"] // "Present" is now a Boolean

        self.p1Label.text = present ? "Present" : "Absent"
        p1ViewColor.backgroundColor = present ? .green

Your fiddle doesn't work as you've configured the JS to be placed in a window.load handler. Given the outdated use of the on* event attibute the functions needs to be at global scope, so change the settings to place the JS just before : jsfiddle.net/qxcwo51n/28. This is also why the snippet I added in to your question works. I would suggest you get rid of the onclick attribute and use proper unobtrusive event handlers, suich as

I am currently trying to now utilize an if statement that checks the score values set in a file that was read earlier as a par value. I am currently unsure of how to have the data be read as specific integers as those values were previously converted to string values in an earlier portion of the assignment. Where would I want to initially start?
I have currently managed to have the program read the .txt files made initially in the beginning part, however, I currently am unsure of how to handle this initial program in regards to converting the final numerical values back to normal, nor am I sure how to get it to properly cycle to check each specific record's final data piece.
This is the data the program pulls from:

Silverlight: bind command of a generic component

I have a problem.
I created a generic container that I use in my application.
This container exports two properties (for now): its content and a button action.
The problem is that I can't bind the action.
The generic container has a button:
<HyperlinkButton x:Name="expandButton" Width="16">

In the code behind I export a ICommand property:
public ICommand ExpandCommand 
        {
            get { return Click.GetCommand(expandButton); }
            set { Click.SetCommand(expandButton, value); }
        }

And, when I trie to use it:
<abo:DashBoardPanel Margin="10" Grid.Row="1" Title="Command Panel"
                                    DataContext="{Binding Commands}"
                                    ExpandCommand="{Binding test}"
                                    >

When the component (the one which uses the generic container) is allocated the following exception fires:

how would you go about overlaying a mask image of sorts on top of a UIScrollView?
For example, I have an image with black on the left and right fading to white in the center. I'd like to use this so that the items in my scroll view gradually fade out to the sides and the center item is completely opaque.
Also, the background of the view the scrollview is placed on is an image (not a solid color) which is dynamic and can change.
Any ideas?

A:

Your question wound up being the best source I could find on the basic problem, so I decided to post my solution here.
If you add the mask directly to the scroll view, you wind up applying the mask to the content itself for some reason -- i. e. the transparency doesn't shift as you scroll.  As per the suggestions of other posts, I put the gradient in a view over (or rather, containing) the scroll view.  As a result, scrollContainer is a UIViewObject whose sole subview is the scroll view in question.
This mask is configured for left-to-right scrolling.  You could change it to top to bottom by manipulating the start and end point properties of the gradient.
The one down side is that this also clips the scroll position bar indicator of the scroll view.  Since my scenario doesn't need one, that's acceptable, but your mileage may vary.
CAGradientLayer *gradient = [CAGradientLayer layer];
gradient.frame = scrollView.bounds;
gradient.colors = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:
                   (id)[[UIColor colorWithWhite:0 alpha:0] CGColor],
                   (id)[[UIColor colorWithWhite:0 alpha:1] CGColor],
                   (id)[[UIColor colorWithWhite:0 alpha:1] CGColor],
                   (id)[[UIColor colorWithWhite:0 alpha:0] CGColor], nil];
gradient.locations=[NSArray arrayWithObjects:
                    [NSNumber numberWithFloat:0],
                    [NSNumber numberWithFloat:.1],
                    [NSNumber numberWithFloat:.9],
                    [NSNumber numberWithFloat:1], nil];
gradient.startPoint=CGPointMake(0, .5);
gradient.endPoint=CGPointMake(1, .5);

Q:

How do I escape/use single quotes in os.system command with python 2?

i have built a small script that runs a simple shell utility called imapsync, with a bunch of variables taken from a dictionary, the command is as follows:
os.system("imapsync --host1 %s --user1 %s --password1 '%s' --host2 %s --user2 %s --password2 '%s' --ssl1 --no-modulesversion --ssl2" % (fromHost, emails, passwords, toHost, emails, passwords))

the deal is that passwords often contain special characters, example: djDJS*^%%%^&)
this imapsync tool allows such characters if enclosed in single quotes: 'djDJS*^%%%^&)'
what I am trying to achieve is post the single quotes in the command, itself.. I tried "'", backquotes - ``, escaped quotes - \'\', enclosing the command in single quotes, nothing worked thus far

A:

After looking through the documentation of imapsync, I found the recommendation to enclose passwords in double quotes within single quotes to avoid common problems.
Since you already start the string with double quotes, you have to escape the double quotes around your password with a backslash \".
There are also two things you could do to make your code even better.
First, you can use .format syntax for string formatting instead of the old % syntax.
Second replace os.system with  subprocess.Popen. This allows you to split your command string into a list of all arguments, which looks more clear.
Your new code would look like
import subprocess

args = [
  "imapsync",
  "--host1",
  fromHost,
  "--user1",
  emails,
  "--password1",
  "'\"{}\"'".format(passwords),
  "--host2",
  toHost,
  "--user2",
  emails,
  "--password2",
  "'\"{}\"'".format(passwords),
  "--ssl1",
  "--no-modulesversion",
  "--ssl2"
]

p = subprocess.Popen(args, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)

output = p.communicate()[0]

These are all simple steps on their own and really only take a few moment. With the exception of the last few steps, it could be possibly automated. However, due to the nature of Illustrator's 3D effect,  it often takes a minor adjustment to get all faces of an object to appear properly, and the manual positioning needed of any duplicates (it varies) actions and scripts tend to fail. Or would just require a stop after every step, which seems ludicrous to me.
The real important aspect is that the same timeline or order of steps is followed correctly as any variation in them can, and often will, result in a slightly different final image. So, it's not enough to remember the steps, I need to remember the order in which the steps are taken.
So.... Thus far I've simply added a typed note of the basic steps within the file itself. Basically what I've listed above would be included within the file. Often set as a non-printing object. This has allowed me to keep a record of the steps needed if I return to the file months or years later and need to remember the correct procedure.
All the styles and colors remain as part of the file so there's no need to document those specifically.
Is there a better method to keeping track of specific procedural steps needed to gain a formatted appearance?

A:

You could record an action regardless and save it next to your file. This would have the benefit of easy repeatability. You could then check the dialog buttons that you wanted to manually tweak.
Now even if you dont want to use the action you can still read

how do I fit a grid of points on a random point cloud

I have a binary image with dots, which I obtained using OpenCV's  goodFeaturesToTrack, as shown on Image1.
Image1 : Cloud of points
I would like to fit a grid of 4*25 dots on it, such as the on shown on Image2 (Not all points are visible on the image, but it is a regular 4*25 points rectangle).
Image2 : Model grid of points
My model grid of 4*25 dots is parametrized by :
    1 - The position of the top left corner
    2 - The inclination of the rectangle with the horizon
The code below shows a function that builds such a model.
This problem seems to be close to a chessboard corner problem. 
I would like to know how to fit my model cloud of points to the input image and get the position and angle of the cloud.
I can easily measure a distance in between the two images (the input one and the on with the model grid) but I would like to avoid having to check every pixel and angle on the image for finding the minimum of this distance.
def ModelGrid(pos, angle, shape):

    # Initialization of output image of size shape
    table = np.zeros(shape)

    # Parameters 
    size_pan = [32, 20]# Pixels
    nb_corners= [4, 25]
    index = np.ndarray([nb_corners[0], nb_corners[1], 2],dtype=np.dtype('int16'))
    angle = angle*np.pi/180

    # Creation of the table
    for i in range(nb_corners[0]):
        for j in range(nb_corners[1]):
            index[i,j,0] = pos[0] + j*int(size_pan[1]*np.sin(angle)) + i*int(size_pan[0]*np.cos(angle))
            index[i,j,1] = pos[1] + j*int(size_pan[1]*np.cos(angle)) - i*int(size_pan[0]*np.sin(angle))

            if 0 < index[i,j,0] < table.shape[0]:
                if 0 <

My team at work is trying to develop a website for both desktop and mobile and we want certain function to only be available for mobile users .We have been brainstorming of different methods to detect mobile and desktop users and have brainstorm the following ideas
1) Check for screensize , if its less than certain size , we can safely assume 
   it is desktop

2) Check user browser user agent string

3) Capability testing

Are there any other methods to detect between Desktop and Mobile , if its possible please list the pros and cons of the method also .
Thanks

Android - junit - unit test - SimpleDateFormat with Timezone

I'm using Android, JUnit and SimpleDateFormat.
I like to do some conversions between String and Date in rfc3339 format with timezone.
Eg: 2017-12-31T23:59:59+02:00 but not 2017-12-31T23:59:59+0200.
Android SimpleDateFormat uses Z pattern but not X pattern (see RFC3339_REGEX_1 below).
But in my JUnit test (jdk1.8), RFC3339_REGEX_1 does not give me the right format (+02:00), but +0200. JUnit test runs well with RFC3339_REGEX_2.
So how can I do something clean which runs well both on Android device and JUnit test?
public static final String RFC3339_REGEX_1 = "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ"; //android
public static final String RFC3339_REGEX_2 = "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssXXX"; //java

A:

The old classes (Date, Calendar and SimpleDateFormat) have lots of problems and design issues, and they're being replaced by the new APIs. And if I'm not wrong, the X pattern doesn't work in all versions (I know that in JDK 6 it wasn't supported, it was introduced only in JDK 7; not sure how this affects different Android versions).
As an alternative, in Android you can use ThreeTen Backport. To make it work, you'll also need ThreeTenABP (see how to use it here).
If you still need to work with java.util.Date, though, this API can make things easier to you. If you want a format like 2017-12-31T23:59:59+02:00, you can convert your java.util.Date to org.threeten.bp.OffsetDateTime (using the org.threeten.bp.DateTimeUtils class to convert the values, and a org.threeten.bp.ZoneOffset to set the offset to +02:00):
// assuming that java.util.Date has value equivalent to 2017-12-31T23:59:59+02:00
Date date = ...
// convert to OffsetDateTime (

Q:

Rust mut borrow fail in closure

Here is my code
struct test_loop {
    is_break: bool,
}
impl test_loop {
    fn run_forever<F>(&mut self, mut f: F)
    where
        F: FnMut() -> (),
    {
        self.is_break = false;
        loop {
            f();
            if self.is_break {
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    fn breakit(&mut self) {
        self.is_break = true;
    }
}
fn main() {
    let mut l = test_loop { is_break: false };
    let f = || {
        l.breakit();
    };
    l.run_forever(f);
}

The code is simple, and I don't want to skip calling l.breakit() in the closure. Now the compiler tells me there is a second mutable borrow problem:
error[E0499]: cannot borrow `l` as mutable more than once at a time
  --> src/main.rs:26:5
   |
23 |     let f = || {
   |             -- first mutable borrow occurs here
24 |         l.breakit();
   |         - first borrow occurs due to use of `l` in closure
25 |     };
26 |     l.run_forever(f);
   |     ^             - first borrow later used here
   |     |
   |     second mutable borrow occurs here

I used a RefCell to fix the compilation problem, but the thread still panics during run-time. Should I remove the l.xxx in the closure? Or there's some way to make the code act like it is running in C++ or another language?

A:

if f() can change test_loop state, then it's natural to add this reference to its signature. This solves the second borrow problem.      
fn run_forever<F>(&mut self, mut f: F)
where
    F: FnMut(&mut Self) -> (), 
{ 
    // call f(self) instead of f()
}

// main
let f = |l: &mut test_

That's called a mouse-slip, and it's part of playing online. Watch some of Carlsen's online play (e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJlOlufG-JM) and you'll see even he mouse-slips on occasion. Common etiquette seems to be to continue playing out the game and try to be more precise next time.

A:

The most standard response you'll see is what Michael said. However, for what it's worth, I've had that happen to me as well and if you ask, occasionally the other player will scoot a piece around until you fix your move. 
It doesn't take too much effort to plan it out so their piece is in its original spot once you've finished your "castle" (for example, they could move a bishop 2 squares over, you move your king off the back row, they move their bishop one square back, you move your rook over, they move their bishop back to its original spot, you move your king to it's standard castle position, then play continues). 
It messes up the time a little and potentially impacts a draw, but that's seldom been relevant in my cases. Having said that, you're also asking your opponent to deliberately make a sub-par move and trust you won't exploit it, not to mention pass on a winning opportunity. Lots of players won't do that for you, but it shouldn't hurt to ask. 
I've also had a few opponents slip up before and offered to let them fix it a few times now. In the dozen or so times I've offered that to my opponent, they've never taken advantage of me for it; they've always just made the move they promised. Likewise, in the dozen or so times someone's offered that to me, they've always operated in good faith as well. 
Again, this isn't the most common response, but there are some players out there who'd much rather play a good game than an easy one. For what it's worth all these matches were Elo ~1600; I don't know how that affects the competitiveness of the matches.

On lichess.org you can ask for takeback even in rated games.
Your case is very reasonable for such request.
In my experience the option is usually available, but here is an explanation of when it is and not available.

After a person has toured my website for N pages, I would like to raise a popup window asking them if they would like to subscribe to my newsletter.
I've found sample code to raise a popup after a delay of some seconds, I've found samples for asking only once, but not one that can track the number of pages traversed.
Where can I find sample JS code to raise a window after a certain number of pages have been traversed?
My simple minded analysis is that normally each invocation of the script on N pages would be a different invocation, and hence would not have any record of the previous page's invocation.  So each copy would have to read a cookie set by the previous copy, increment it, and store back.  Then, when N=3 and whatever other conditions I think are appropriate are satisified, the popup is triggered.

A:

Your analysis is correct! You'll need cookies of some sort, whether tracked server side or just good old fashioned javascript cookies.
Here's the best rundown I've seen of how to implement them: Quirksmode Cookies
function createCookie(name,value,days) {
    if (days) {
        var date = new Date();
        date.setTime(date.getTime()+(days*24*60*60*1000));
        var expires = "; expires="+date.toGMTString();
    }
    else var expires = "";
    document.cookie = name+"="+value+expires+"; path=/";
}

function readCookie(name) {
    var nameEQ = name + "=";
    var ca = document.cookie.split(';');
    for(var i=0;i < ca.length;i++) {
        var c = ca[i];
        while (c.charAt(0)==' ') c = c.substring(1,c.length);
        if (c.indexOf(nameEQ) == 0) return c.substring(nameEQ.length,c.length);
    }
    return null;
}

function eraseCookie(name) {
    createCookie(name,"",-1);
}

To update the value of the cookie to track page count - again assuming you aren't doing this server-side - you'll need to reset the cookie and set a new one with the new

Recently I went to Korea for holiday. I don't want to carry my 580EXII due to the weight so I was looking for a cheap, good and small flash.
The flash that I got was the 270EXII. It costs about HK$980 ( US$125 )
You did not mention you are planning to use the flash in a studio or outdoor or travel, so I am going to share my experience using it as a travel flash in a simple walk-around setup.
Canon EOS 60D, EF-S 15-85mm, 270EXII
Some criticism that I read online about the 270EXII:

28mm or 50mm only, no 24mm (notice my lens wide end is 24mm equiv.)
under powered
pricy compared to 320EX, which is also pricy, and 430EXII (best bet of money)

I tested it in shop, firstly the underpowered statement. It's twice as powerful as the internal flash, which is GN13 on a 60D. As far as I know, most DSLR have internal flash that has a GN rating around that range, which is considerably more powerful than the tiny flash you find on point-and-shoot. When I was in Korea, in bright daylight, I can use it as fill-flash without problem at f/8.0 and ISO 100. If I need extra reach, bumping the ISO to 400 is usually enough to fill in some light on subjects that is more than 20 meters away.
As far as travel/holiday photography goes, 270EXII is powerful enough as long as you are not doing something like trying to overpower the sun.
As a fill, the 28mm didn't really bother me much. Sure a 14mm wide panel diffuser would be helpful, but I don't miss it a whole lot.
At $125 it is pricy compared to many other non-canon flashes. But you get a few things in return:

Good build quality, dropped my camera with the 270EXII attatched at knee height TWICE during the trip, not even a scratch.
Near silent recycling (on website it says its silent, but its not, you can hear it if you are in a quiet room)
Relatively fast recycling, MUCH faster than the internal flash. If I need to shoot in burst, I bump the ISO to 400 or 800 and the flash can handle it quite well. It

Почему я не могу присвоить значение переменной showModal , внутри ajax функции ? this.showModal = true; - показывает popup окно. Как сделать правильно ? Пример кода:

    } else {
        console.log("Error");
        console.log(response);
    }
  }

I've got a following class
public class Animal {

    private int hash;

    public Animal(int hash) {
        this.hash = hash;
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        System.out.println(hash);
        return hash;
    }
}

And this code
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<Animal, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            map.put(new Animal(16 * i), i);
        }

        Animal an = new Animal(16*4);
        map.put(an, 1);

        for (int i = 5; i < 9; i++) {
            map.put(new Animal(16 * i), i);
        }
        Integer value = map.get(an);
    }

As I understand, all this values should be in one single bucket (due to their hashcodes). At the last call map.get(an), hashCode() is called only once (according to console), but should not it be called several times while iteration through bucket and finding an entry with the right hashCode() ?
EDIT1: If I implement equals (with console logging), it is not called either (according to console again), it is only called when there are two objects with the same hashcode (if for example I add this to my code map.put(new Animal(16*3), 4);, and in this case hashCode() is called twice when getting an object from map).

A:

A single bucket may contain keys having different hashCode, and the hashCode of the keys of the relevant bucket is compared to the key you are adding/searching for. However, the hashCode is cached in the Map.Entry, so there's no need to call the key's hashCode method for Entrys that are already in the Map:
static class Node<K,V> implements Map.Entry<K,V> {
    final int hash;
    final K key;
    V value;
    Node<K,V> next;

    Node(int hash, K key, V value, Node<K,V> next) {
        this.hash = hash; // here the hash code is cached
        this

And I'm inserting values via this code (simplified for question): 
SimpleDateFormat dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy/MM/dd");
Date tmpDate = dateFormat.parse("2014/01/12");
values.put(columnKey, tmpDate.toString());
db.insert("table_name", null, values);

and after getting again value of row 'date' from database I'm getting this error:
java.text.ParseException: Unparseable date: "Sun Jan 12 00:00:00 EST 2014" (at offset 0)

If I save date with format yyyy/MM/dd shouldn't it be stored with the same format?
Thanks from advice.
Edit:
I have no idea why but after this: 
DatePicker tmpDatePicker = (DatePicker) dateDialog.findViewById(R.id.date_picker);
SimpleDateFormat dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd");
Date tmpDate = dateForma.parse("2014-01.12");
tmpDate.toString();

Output is Sun Jan 12 00:00:00 EST 2014.
How can I change it? 

A:

Your own answer is correct.
But I must say that the java.util.Date, .Calendar, and java.text.SimpleDateFormat classes are notoriously troublesome. Most folks are glad to avoid them and instead use Joda-Time (or the new java.time package in Java 8 but not Android).
Joda-Time 2.3 offers a LocalDate class for working with date only, without a time portion or time zone.
Joda-Time by default uses the ISO 8601 standard way to format string representations of date-time values, apparently what you seek. If needed Joda-Time can use localized or custom formats as well.
String input = "2014-01-12";
LocalDate localDate = new LocalDate( input );
String output = localDate.toString();

You can convert to and from a java.util.Date as needed for other classes/frameworks.
java.util.Date date = localDate.toDate();
String dateAsString = date.toString();

When run…
input: 2014-01-12
output: 2014-01-12
dateAsString: Sun Jan 12 00:00:00 PST

Q:

Source Control Server on Windows With Custom Highlighting Support

We have an old language we use to write scripts on our optimization software at work (Called MoDL if anybody is familiar w/ it). At the moment we're trying to have some kind of source control set up between couple of the engineers that work on this topic. What we want is to have a central repository of common applications. This would help the team maintain and improve these tools in a controlled environment while giving the more senior members of the team to check merges. 
We have couple constraints to adhere for company regulations and I couldn't find any tool that fits our requirements yet.

We cannot use hosted solutions, anything we do has to be on company's network
If there's a web component to the source control server that we can keep markdown documentation, that'd make our life much better. We really don't want to keep documentation in random Excel, Word or text files.
We'd very much like custom syntax highlighting support for MoDL. We have a base package we developed to use in Sublime Text and would like to transform it to be used w/ our browser viewers as well
It'd be much preferred if this was on a Windows machine. We can do Linux but it would require much more resources (again, because of IT policies of our company)
We'd like to use git, but we're also open to other version control systems

If anybody can help us with finding a tool or pointing us in the right direction, that'd be much appreciated!

A:

There are several options if you want to self-host 

You could take a look at Stash (from Atlassian). You can integrate Jira (bug/feature tracker), Confluence (a wiki) and a few other things with it too. Seems like you can install it on Windows as well. I've used Stash before and while its quite good I prefer GitHub Enterprise. Jira is great however
If you can relax your Windows only constraint then I'd much rather go with Github Enterprise. Its the same clean UI as GitHub. Their server comes pre-packaged in a Linux VM so all you need to do is run it on VMWare and its very easy to do. Their support is great as well. It is slightly expensive however but definitely worth it. You can also integrate Jira (although their inbuilt issue tracker is quite good too)

#Data Cleaning
levels(power$City) <- c(levels(power$City), "Auckland")
power$City[power$City == "Ackland"] <- "Auckland"

#Removing irrelevant data (only houses in Auckland and Wellington are considered)
power$City <- power$City[-c(496,499), ]

After I run this code, the misspelled words ("Ackland") does not change to Auckland as I expected.
This highlighted row as shown in this image is supposed to change to Auckland: 

A:

To address your issue collapsing factor levels 'Ackland' and 'Auckland' (and also assuming you want power$City to be/remain a factor):
One method is to pass the levels() function a named list, each name being the correct labels of the desired levels (in your case the correct names of the cities in your data set) see:
Cleaning up factor levels (collapsing multiple levels/labels) for a general example.
However, just as a heads up, watch for the extra space behind the Ackland and Auckland character strings in your data set:
    # first view classes to confirm power$City is a factor
     > apply(power, class)     # --> or is.factor(power$City) will work to
        Area      City  P.Winter  P.Summer 
    "numeric"  "factor" "numeric" "numeric" 

    # Notice spaces behind "Ackland " and "Auckland "
     > levels(power$City)
    [1] "Ackland "   "Auckland "  "Sydney"     "Wellington"

Passing a named list to levels() works once you account for the spaces: 
    levels(power$City) <-  list(Auckland = c("Ackland ", "Auckland "), Sydney = c("Sydney"), Wellington = c("Wellington"))

    # Now only three factor levels (notice this also took care of the extra spaces)
      > levels(power$City)
     [1] "Auckland"   "Sydney"     "Wellington"

You now have 3 levels instead of 4, notice this also took care of the spaces in the level labels 
Subset to include only relevant cities
       subpower <- power[which(

tenho o seguinte código rodando em NodeJS

/*jshint esversion: 6 */
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const app = express();
const port = 8080;
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false}));
app.post("/home", (req, res)=>{
    res.set("Content-Type", "text/plain");
    res.set("Accept-Charset", "utf-8");
    const msg = req.body.phrase;
    console.log("RECEIVED: "+msg);
    res.send("frase : "+msg);
});
app.listen(port, (err)=>{
    if (err){
        throw err;
    }
    console.log("Server started on http://localhost:"+port);
});

quando faço uma requisição via post contendo os caracteres + e &, esses caracteres são substituídos ou o resultado retorna errado, exemplo da requisição:

fetch("http://localhost:8080/home", {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {'Content-Type':'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'}, 
    body: 'phrase=eu+ela&voce'
}).then(function(response){
    return response.text();
  }).then(function(text){
   console.log(text); 
  });

eu+voce&ela

retorna
 eu voce

A:

Basicamente basta você substituir o caractere de + por %2B e o caractere & por %26.
Mas você pode utilizar a biblioteca urlencode para ajudar nesse processo, para instalar basta executar o comando:
npm install urlencode

Para usa-lá, você deve importar:
const urlencode = require('urlencode');

E alterar o parâmetro body do método fetch:
body: `phrase=${urlencode('eu+ela&voce')}`

Caso haja a necessidade de decodificar:

Using strongswan, what's the difference between auto=add, and auto=start?

The docs on this are pretty vague,

what operation, if any, should be done automatically at IPsec startup. add loads a connection without starting it. route loads a connection and installs kernel traps. If traffic is detected between leftsubnet and rightsubnet, a connection is established. start loads a connection and brings it up immediately. ignore ignores the connection. This is equal to deleting a connection from the config file. Relevant only locally, other end need not agree on it.

What does it mean to load a connection without starting it vs bringing it up immediately? Can anyone provide a simple example?

A:

The introduction document on the strongSwan wiki has some more information about this. The three options to start connections are as follows:

Manually (or by remote peers): Connections with auto=add are loaded but nothing happens automatically afterwards. They can then be initiated manually using ipsec up <name> (provided a single hostname/IP is configured in right).
Such connections also allow remote peers to initiate a connection, given their IP matches whatever is configured in right (so you'll often see connections with right=%any in remote access scenarios, where the clients' IP addresses are generally unknown).
Automatically: With auto=start a connection is loaded and the IKE daemon will immediately start to connect to the remote host configured in right. This is basically like manually calling ipsec up for these connections directly after the IKE daemon got started.
On demand: The IKE daemon will load connections with auto=route and install trap policies, based on the traffic selectors configured with left|rightsubnet, in the underlying IPsec implementation, for instance, the Linux kernel. When the kernel later encounters traffic that matches these policies it will request the IKE daemon to initiate the connection.
Such connections can also be initiated manually using ipsec up.
Furthermore it is possible to remove the policies installed in the kernel later on using ipsec unroute. The connection then has the same status as one that got added with auto=add. Likewise, connections that were loaded with auto=add (or auto=start) can be routed using ipsec route.

A:

It's worth noting that auto=start will not re-establish the tunnel if it is shut down. This can cause issues where the tunnel will

Maybe I'm doing something wrong and forgot to call some close or release method? I think using the retained fragment with the loader is a common pattern and should not be memory leaks here.

A:

Your call to getLoaderManager() in ModelFragment ends up creating a new LoaderManagerImpl instance, which contains a reference to FragmentActivity. See below

I have a data frame in R where I want to sum values from rows that share a name and record the fake name for each of those rows. Can anyone think of an efficient way to do this? I wrote a for-loop (copied below), but it is extremely inefficient on the large dataset. 
Thanks in advance!
A few things are given in this dataset: (1) no more than 2 sites will share a name and (2) the two sites will always be next in consecutive rows. I'm also open to non-R solutions, although I'm not as familiar with other frameworks. 
Example initial data:
name, fake_name, value1, value2, value3
siteX, siteX, 4, 2, 0.5
siteX, siteX2, 1, 4, 0.2
siteY, siteY, 2, 1, 0.4
siteZ, siteZ, 8, 3, 0.2

Transformed to: 
name, value1, value2, value3, fake_name, dup_fake_name
siteX, 5, 6, 0.7, siteX, siteX2
siteY, 2, 1, 0.4, siteY, NA
siteZ, 8, 3, 0.2, siteZ, NA

A:

Provided you don't care about the last two columns in your transformed data, you can aggregate entries
 df <- structure(list(
     name = c("siteX", "siteX", "siteY", "siteZ"),
     fake_name = c("siteX", "siteX2", "siteY", "siteZ"), 
     value1 = c(4L, 1L, 2L, 8L), 
     value2 = c(2L, 4L, 1L

Q:

BIRT - using multiple webservices to get the data

I am trying to generate a report using Eclipse BIRT report designer. 
The scenario is this: 
There are 2 web service data sources. There are 2 datasets for webservices 'WS1' and 'WS2' respectively. 
The output element 'COUNTRYID' of one webservice 'WS1' would go as input for another webservice 'WS2'.
What I did: 

Created a parameter COUNTRYID. 
Created a dummy Computed Column in the dataset of the web service 'WS1' with the expression:
    params["COUNTRYID"].value=row["COUNTRYID"]

Now the input parameters for the 'WS2' dataset is related to the global paramter 'COUNTRYID'. 
When I run the report, I see that the global parameter contains the value from the 'WS1' output. 

But the report does not display the values from the response of the web service 'WS2'
My questions: 

How can I see, if the webservice got fired or not? 
How can I see, if the webservice got fired with correct values ? 

A:

WS1 is not fired unless it is explicitely bound to a report element. Typically, to achieve this we apply following steps:

insert a data element at the beginning of the report body
turn the property visibility of this new element to false (or let it visible during testing)
bind it to the first dataset WS1

It will force a silent execution of WS1, and therefore this will populate your parameter COUNTRYID before WS2 runs.
However this approach would not work if:

WS2 dataset has to be used to populate selection items of a report parameter (which does not seem to be the case here)
If COUNTRYID parameter is used at render time. This point is much more annoying, if you need this parameter in chart expressions for example. If so, i would recommend to store WS1 in a report variable instead of (or why not in addition to) a report parameter. See this topic to see how to create a report variable. 

You can initialize it at the same place you did for the report parameter with:
vars["COUNTRYID"]=row["COUNTRYID"];

and use it anywhere with 
vars

I have a function to log php vaiables to the file. There is a section which handles objects elseif(is_object($var))... and it works well with any application objects. BUT it does not work if the variable is objects of StdClass. I dont understand where is the difference between other objects and StdClass object. Here is the code of the function: 
function varLog( $var, $log = 'info', $depth = 2, $round = 0)
{
    $logFile = __DIR__ . '/../log/' . $log . '.log';
    file_put_contents( $logFile, '(' . gettype( $var ) . ') ', FILE_APPEND );

    if( in_array( gettype($var), ['integer', 'double', 'string'] ) )
    {
        file_put_contents( $logFile, $var . PHP_EOL, FILE_APPEND );
    }
    elseif( in_array( gettype($var), ['boolean', 'NULL'] ) )
    {
        $var = is_null( $var ) ? 'NULL' : ($var ? 'TRUE' : 'FALSE');
        file_put_contents( $logFile, $var . PHP_EOL, FILE_APPEND );
    }
    elseif ( is_array( $var ) )
    {
        file_put_contents( $logFile, 'length ' . count($var) . PHP_EOL, FILE_APPEND );

        foreach ( $var as $key => $val )
        {
            file_put_contents( $logFile, str_repeat('    ', $round + 1) . $key . ' => ', FILE_APPEND );
            if ( $round + 1 <= $depth )
            {
                varLog( $val, $log, $depth, $round + 1 );
            }
            else
            {
                file_put_contents( $logFile, '(' . gettype( $val ) . ')' . PHP_EOL, FILE_APPEND );

Q:

Storyboard and customs cells I dont want to be reused

In my app I have a table view with 12 types of custom cells.
I designed each within the storyboard.
In general everything works fine - thanks to your tutorials :)
My problem is, that I have individual styles an additional data in each cell - therefore I don't want them to be reused.
How can I generate a individual custom cell from storyboard to provide it in the - 
tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:indexPath?
Any suggestions? 
Thanks
Dominic
Added:
    newCell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:cellType]; 
    cell = newCell;
    [cell styleWithElement:element andResubItem:resubItem];

my problem is, I need another way to create a custom-styled cell from the storyboard than the quouted above - I have no XIB and the above way is the only way I know to create my cell.
Could it be a solution to create a celltype once the above way and then copy the cell? Is there a way to copy a cell-object?

A:

You can generate a random cell ID each time so it won't be reused.
However, that would not be very good for scroll performance and memory consumption, so consider actually reusing the cells (i.e. come up with a way to replace data in them).
Edit: 
you can always just copy the views from one to another, something along these lines:
UITableViewCell* myCell = [UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyle:YOUR_CELL_STYLE reuseIdentifier:YOUR_RANDOM_ID];
for (UIView *view in newCell.subviews) {
    [view removeFromSuperview];
    [myCell addSubview: view];
}

You may also need to adjust the frame of myCell to be the same as that of newCell, and if newCell is an action target for any events (e.g. clicking a control element within the cell triggers some action defined in the cell class) you'll need to reassign those to the myCell, too.
Edit2:
To move actions you could do something like this:
NSSet* targets = [control allTargets];
for(id

[EDITED 2015-07-23 to fix a small error pointed out in comments. EDITED 2015-11-07 to fix a mathematical typo.]
It seem that this can fail even when $x$ and $y$ are 2-by-2 matrices. We'll choose them such that $xy\neq yx$, choose $f$ such that $f(x)=x$ and $g$ such that $g(x+y)=x+y$.
Fix $a>0$ to be determined later. Let
$\newcommand{\twomat}[4]{\begin{bmatrix} #1 & #2 \cr #3 & #4 \end{bmatrix}}$
$$x_0= \twomat{2a}{0}{0}{0} \quad,\quad y_0=\twomat{1}{1}{1}{1} $$
which are both positive semi-definite.
Since $x_0+y_0$ is hermitian with trace $2a+2$ and determinant $2a$, it has eigenvalues
$$ r = (1+a)-\sqrt{1+a^2}\quad,\quad R= (1+a)+\sqrt{1+a^2} $$
both of which are strictly positive. Furthermore, one checks that $r< 2a<R$.
Now let $x=R^{-1}x_0$, $y=R^{-1}y_0$, so that $\sigma(x)=\{0, 2a/R\}$ and $\sigma(x+y)=\{r/R, 1\}$. Pick $t_0$ such that
$$ 0 < r/R < t_0 < 2a/R < 1. $$

Define $f$ to take the value $0$ on the interval $[0,t_0]$ and $2a/R$ on the interval $[2a/R,\infty)$ with the obvious linear interpolation on the interval $[t_0,2a/R]$.
Define $g(t)=t$ on the interval $[0,r/R]$ and $g(t)=1$ on the interval $[t_0,\infty)$ with the obvious linear interpolation on the interval $[r/R, t_0]$.

Then both $f$ and $g$ are continuous increasing functions $[0,\infty)\to [0,1]$ and by construction $fg=f$. Since


Onclick for imageview created in java, not xml

Question
I have created some ImageViews by code in android by in the onCreate() class
The class implements the view.onclick()..
The ImageView doesn't register that it has been clicked. That's the problem
should I use setTag(1) instead, how can I use tag in the onClick() ? :
a1 = new ImageView(this);
a1.setImageResource(R.drawable.examplepicture);
a1.setId(1);

public void onClick(View v) {   

    switch (v.getId()) {

    case (1):
        Toast.makeText(ScrollView1.this, "id200", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
        break;
    }
}`

A:

You need to something like this
a1.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener({
    public void onClick(View v) {   

        switch (v.getId()) {

        case (1):
            Toast.makeText(ScrollView1.this, "id200", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
            break;
        }
     }
}));

Update from comment
You should store all your image views in a list (or array), implement the onClickListener (rather than using it as an anonymous inner class) and add them in a for loop, something like this.
class MyOnClickListener implements View.OnClickListener{

    public void onClick(View v) {   

        // do something with your View v for example ((ImageView)v.setImageBitmap(yourImage)
        switch (v.getId()) {

        case (1):
            Toast.makeText(ScrollView1.this, "id200", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
            break;
        }
     } 
 }

MyOnClickListener listener = new MyOnClickListener();

// cycle through adding listener to yuor view
for(ImageView view : imageViews) {
    view.setOnClickListener(listener)
}

If you wanted to perform a specific function on the view you are getting passed it as an argument and so can perform whatever operation on it.
// do something with your View v passed as onClick param, for example ((ImageView)v.setImageBitmap(yourImage)

I have written the following function.
function obj()
{
     this.a;
}
obj.prototype.catch = function()
{
    alert('Catched')
}
obj.prototype.do = function()
{
    alert('called');
}

What i need is, to call  obj::catch()   after obj::do() is called and the call must be performed from inside obj::do() 
So how to pass the local function of obj to setTimeout
i have tried
obj.prototype.do = function()
 { 
     window.setTimeout('"'+this.catch+'()"',1000);
     alert('called');
 }

It does not worked
Then i tried
 obj.prototype.do = function()
 { 
     window.setTimeout('"'+this+'.catch()"',1000);
     alert('called');
 }

which gave me the following error on Chrome console
Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL

So i tried the following dirty method(is it really dirty ?)
 obj.prototype.do = function()
 { 
     this.pid = randomVal(100);
     window['temp'+this.pid] = this;
     window.setTimeout("temp"+this.pid+".catch();",1000);
     alert('called');
 }
 function randomVal(bound)//returns a random number between 0 and <bound>
 {
       return (Math.floor(Math.random()*(bound)));
 }

That worked.
so why the first two methods not worked.Is there any other way to do the same thing without global variables..
The second method and last method are almost similar .But why am i gettng the error in second method..?
The worked code can be found here
http://jsfiddle.net/jXhAs/

A:

Don't pass strings to setTimeout … ever.
var self = this; // Because the scope will change
setTimeout(function () { self.catch() },1000);

Or if you are using JS 1.8.5:
setTimeout(this.catch.bind(this),1000);

You can read more about bind

A:

You should pass a function to setTimeout (not a string):
Example:
var self

I am writing a utility, C#, to import a large CSV with about 80 columns into a SQL Server 2008 table.  
The CSV needs manipulation before import e.g. merging some columns, converting dates etc.  I am therefore constructing an INSERT INTO statement like so:
INSERT INTO table VALUES ('abc','blah',...)

My problem is that the table contains a column of type UNIQUEINDENTIFIER.  It's a problem because I would like to re-use an existing method which takes a collection of values and returns the string of values to pop directly into my INSERT INTO statement with apostrophes dealt with, injection attacks munged out etc.
Is there a way of generating a valid literal for a UNIQUEIDENTIFIER that I can pass to this method?  I tried Guid.NewGuid.ToString(), which gives me a literal like so 'bfdb0297-2018-4555-ac12-88064944a671', but my query then errors with a data truncation exception.  I also tried with the hyphens removed.  I expected 32 hex characters to work.
I know that a parameterised query is the correct way to go but that would mean a significant re-work of existing code.
I'm pretty good with C# and bluff-worthy with SQL Server.
[EDIT]
I've done several things.  First, wrote a query which updates that column with Guid.NewGuid at it works.  Therefore, the truncation error is not from there.  Checking the SQL Server reference leads me to believe that a truncation error is not returned from a bad value in an id column, rather it's an invalid value error.  I've also taken into account Aaron's comment that significant work is not an excuse for not doing it right and have created a method to generate a parameterised query which is now working fine.  
Many thanks to all responders.

A:

A literal UNIQUEIDENTIFIER in SQL Server looks like this:
SELECT {guid'8DEC377B-6D75-424B-AE01-D3727993C7F6'}

As seen in the documentation:

It is a sequence formed by the keyword GUID followed by hexadecimal
  digits in the form known as registry format: 8-4-4-4-12 enclosed in
  single quotes.

Why do some reflex actions involve interneurons, but some don't?

According to what I know, the reflex arc of knee jerk reflex doesn't involve interneuron, but other reflex action (e.g. removing your hand when touching hot things) do involve interneurons. Why is that the case?

A:

The "knee jerk" reflex is a stretch reflex, as @John's answer indicates. It is unfortunately named the "knee jerk" for the response observed in the corner case where rapid, short extension of the leg at the knee is elicited by tapping the patellar tendon with a percussion hammer during a physical exam. Despite being named for this specific phenomenon, this reflex contributes to setting resting muscle tone, controlling the response to a load, and coordinating synergist and antagonist actions. You can read about this in some detail in Kandel's Principles of Neural Science, Chapter 36.
The sensory portion of this reflex involves a proprioceptive sensory organ called a muscle spindle that detects the stretch of a skeletal muscle.  All human (and most mammalian) skeletal muscles have these sensory organs, so this is not specific to the quadriceps at the knee. Several are tested in a similar way to the quadriceps as part of a neurological exam (see Brust, Practice of Neural Science, Chapter 6), but, as is the case with most reflexes, they are more complex than is taught in introductory biology. This sensory organ is continuously active, sending information to the cortex, the cerebellum, synergist and antagonist muscles, as well as back to the muscle in which the organ itself is found (again, see Kandel).
Answers about "why" a physiologic system is set up in a particular way are generally speculative, but stretch reflexes in muscle are definitely different from other reflexes. Unlike, for example, the withdrawal reflex, the sensory organ (the muscle spindle) is actually part of the effector (the muscle), and provides continuous feedback to the effector, controlling its primary function (contraction/production of tension). Additionally, the processing and sensitization/desensitization that an interneuron might provide in a different reflex arc are provided by innervation and control of the spindle itself by $\gamma$-motonuerones, among others.

$\gamma$-motoneurone function is essential for controlling the sensitivity of muscle spindle afferents as length detectors

There are additional reflex arcs with the same sensory part that involve processing and inhibition/excitation

Convergence of ratios of successive terms in Newton's method

I was experimenting with ratios of success iterations of Newton's method for a class assignment, and I noticed that for $x_n$ near a root $x^*$ of $f$, for which $f(x^*)\neq 0$, then
$$
\left(\frac{f_{n+1}}{f_n}\right)^2\approx\left|\frac{f_n}{f_{n-1}}\right|
$$
or alternatively
$$
\frac{\ln\left|f_{n+1}/f_n\right|}{\ln\left|f_n/f_{n-1}\right|}\approx 2
$$
Where $f_n = f(x_n)$ and $x_n = x_{n-1} - \frac{f(x_{n-1})}{f'(x_{n-1})}$ as usual.
I attempted to prove this as follows:
$$
\begin{aligned}
f\left(x_{n+1}\right) = f\left(x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}\right)&\approx f(x_n) - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}f'(x_n) + \frac12\left(\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}\right)^2f''(x_n) + \cdots \\
& = \frac12\left(\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}\right)^2f''(x_n)
\end{aligned}
$$
and so
$$
\frac{f(x_{n+1})}{f(x_n)}\approx\frac12\frac{f(x_n)f''(x_n)}{(f'(x_n))^2}
$$
and then plugging this into the original approximation yields
$$
\frac{f^2(x_n)}4\left(\frac{f''(x_n)}{(f'(x_n))^2}\right)^2\approx\frac12\frac{f(x_{n-1})f''(x_{n-1})}{(f'(x_{n-1}))^2}
$$
and I can't see how this is useful, or where

Correction: MIDI was never designed initially to transmit sample data, but it was added later as an SDS standard. [This is something I've never worked with, but apparently the SY99 can sample dump over MIDI.]
http://www.4front-tech.com/pguide/midi/midi8.html
If you go that route, maybe something like this SY manager would be useful - http://www.fm-alive.com/pages/SYM.aspx
Otherwise, if you go with the USB kit, I'd ask the kit maker for their instruction sheet/pdf to see what kind of a task it would be.
Note: I've never taken this precise model apart, so this is a generic answer.
Most Yamaha keyboards, certainly of that age, are pretty simple to strip, so long as you've got long screwdrivers [they do tend to put screws in long barrels] I'd recommend an electric driver with long bits, as they never were tempted to put too few screws in anything ;) The casing is unlikely to also be clipped together, it will probably be screws only.
Generally, you're unlikely to find odd springs that suddenly leap out at you, everything will be set pretty tidily within the case.
I'd imagine, if the kit makers did their job right, that the drive swap will be relatively simple, once you've got the 473 screws out.
Edit:
I found a service manual at https://www.manualslib.com/manual/998630/Yamaha-Sy99.html?page=15#manual - you're lucky, a mere 24 screws holding the bottom casing on ;-)

BTW, a quick Google shows lots of these things on Amazon for $150 or so, but according to https://yamahamusicians.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=7440 there's one you can get for about 35.

Is there a workaround, such as connecting the synth to a PC (e.g. via MIDI cables) with some software that can bridge the gap and let me save/load data?

Yes. You can save your patches and settings by a mid

Create a basic auto-complete suggestion list

How can I create an auto-complete suggestion list below the search box that:

Users can use keyboard Down & Up key to navigate between them?
Users can use Esc button to close the suggestion list?
When users press keyboard Down or Up key, the suggestion that is selected will be filled inside the search box?

I'm writing a function to add some extra rows to a data frame i am building.
I've read many questions and answer's from previous OPs. But all answers, tips and tricks i found there do not work for me.
For this question i have the following test data frame:
tst <- data.frame("col 1" = c("a","a", "c"), "keyword test" = c("What", "Why", "how"), check.names = F)
> tst
  col 1 keyword test
1     a         What
2     a          Why
3     c          how

As you can see i have spaces in the data frame which i cannot remove, since the next tool is expecting spaces in the column names (DON'T ask me why!).
Now i want for example to filter all rows starting with "how" and replace "how" with "no_idea". This happens inside a temp DF. So that later on i can add the row "c"  "no_idea" to the original data frame.
The function i wrote for this looks like this:
add_keyword <- function(df, filterColumn, filterValue,replacement){
  library(plyr)
  library(dplyr)
  temp_df <- dplyr::filter_(df, filterColumn == filterValue)
  temp_df$`Target keyword` <- gsub(as.character(filterValue), as.character(replacement), temp_df$`Target keyword`)
  df_out <- rbind(df, temp_df)
  return(df_out)
}

tst2 <- add_keyword(tst, "keyword test", "how", "no_idea")
Of course if I run the lines inside the function outside the function it works perfect.
The result i would like to have inside tst2
> tst2
  col 1 keyword test
1     a         What
2     a         Why
3     c         how
4     c         no_idea 

A:

We can do this with interp from lazyeval:
library(dplyr)
library(lazyeval)

add_keyword <- function(df, filterColumn, filterValue,replacement){
    temp_df <- df %>%
        filter_(interp(~ var == fval,

Q:

Looping over Complex JSON Object

I have created an application that accepts faxes in xml format and converts them to json objects so that I can take what I need from the fax which is the base64 string located in the "file contents" variable within the document.
This is the code that I have to do that.
exports.receiveFax = function(req, res){
       var form = new formidable.IncomingForm();
           form.keepExtensions = true;
           form.parse(req, function(err, fields, files) { 
           parseString(fields.xml, function (err, result) {
              base64 = result['InboundPostRequest']['FaxControl'][0]['FileContents'];
              ....
              ....
              //then we decode 'base64 and save it to the database

This is good if there is only one field labeled file contents. Now I am trying to alter my code to check for a variable amount of base64 strings and return them all for storing them in the file system. The xml documents always look the same but I can't seem to figure out how to make a loop that will check for variable amounts of base64 strings. This is what the document looks like.

k = 1

deltats = np.linspace(0.01,0.1,5)

A = [[0,1],[-k,0]]
I = [[1,0],[0,1]]

A = np.array(A)
I = np.array(I)

X0 = [0,np.sqrt(k)]

X0 = np.array(X0)

for deltat in deltats:
        x1 = []
        x2 = []
        B = I + deltat * A
        ts = np.linspace(0,100,int(100/deltat))
        for i,t in enumerate(ts):
                C = np.linalg.matrix_power(B,i)
                x1.append(np.matmul(C,X0)[0])
                x2.append(np.matmul(C,X0)[1])

        plt.plot(ts,x1,label=r'$x_{1}$, $\Delta t$ = '+str(deltat))
        #plt.plot(ts,x2,label=r'$x_{2}$, $\Delta t$ = '+str(deltat))

plt.xlabel('t')
plt.ylabel('X')
plt.legend(loc='best')
plt.show()

And you see, when we expect the solution of this system of ODEs with initial condition of $X_{0} = \begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
\sqrt{k}
\end{bmatrix}$ to be $X(t) = \begin{bmatrix}
\sin(\sqrt{k}t) \\
\sqrt{k}\cos(\sqrt{k}t)
\end{bmatrix}$ and clearly the solution should be bounded smaller than 1, but you see it's not bounded when you continue the integration long enough:

I'm going to implements password recovery in my authentication. I haven't put this together in a while and wondering if there is anything I ought to be aware of.
My idea at the moment is:

User clicks "Forgot my password" to go the password recover page: a
form with an email field
They enter their email, and an email is sent to that address with a
link and password recover token/key (MD5 string - it just needs to
be somewhat random and long right?). An entry is also made in the
password_recovery database table which ties that token to their
account, and an expire date (1 hour?)
They retrieve the email and click the link to take them to a
password set page: two fields to enter their password, and confirm
their password again.
Done, please login again with new password

Does that seem OK? Anything changed over the years where this approach is no longer recommended?
UPDATE
Additions that I opted for:

I store the token in the database hashed. If a hacker we to be able to access the database table somehow, they wouldn't be able to use the stored tokens .. hopefully (hashed with sha256)

A:

Does that seem OK?

Yes, assuming emails are the primary form of authentication of your site.

Anything changed over the years where this approach is no longer recommended?

Not that I know of.
Here are some points that you need to take into consideration.
What type of feedback you will give the user
When the email does not exist, what will you say and do?

If you display a message like "Sorry, this email doesn't exist", you are effectively leaking information about who is or isn't in your database.
So instead, you can display a message along the lines of "If this email corresponds to a user account, you will get further instructions". This is more secure, but it might confuse your users ("why didn't I get the email?").
A third option is to always send an email, only with a different content if the email wasn't in your database. This opens up your form for abuse though, as anybody could type anybody else's email, and your emails would eventually be spammed.

If your system uses username, it might be better to ask for the username, not the email address. You send the recovery email to email address associated with the account,

Q:

Can a key manger reference a credential store in WildFly?

I created a credential store and saved the application keystore password in it.
Plan is to use the password alias in TLS keymanager and keystore.
So, here is what I tried.
/subsystem=elytron/key-store=LocalhostKeyStore:add(path=server.keystore,relative-to=jboss.server.config.dir,credential-reference={clear-text="keystore_password"},type=JKS)

/subsystem=elytron/key-manager=LocalhostKeyManager:add(key-store=LocalhostKeyStore,alias-filter=server,credential-reference={clear-text="key_password"})

/subsystem=elytron/server-ssl-context=LocalhostSslContext:add(key-manager=LocalhostKeyManager)

/subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/https-listener=https:undefine-attribute(name=security-realm)

/subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/https-listener=https:write-attribute(name=ssl-context,value=LocalhostSslContext)

Above one with clear text works flawlessly but when tried to substitute credential store it does not work.
Create a store and store the password.
/subsystem=elytron/credential-store=LocalhostKeyStore:add(relative-to=jboss.server.data.dir, location=appks.jceks,create=true,credential-reference={clear-text=kspass, type=JKS})

/subsystem=elytron/credential-store=LocalhostKeyStore:add-alias(alias=kspass,secret-value=secret)

/subsystem=elytron/key-store=LocalhostKeyStore:add(path=server.keystore,relative-to=jboss.server.config.dir,credential-reference={store=LocalhostKeyStore, alias=kspass})

Getting error in the below script.
/subsystem=elytron/key-manager=LocalhostKeyManager:add(key-store=LocalhostKeyStore,alias-filter=server,credential-reference={store="LocalhostKeyStore

pwnat is an open-source tool that supposedly addresses this problem. It says :

pwnat is a tool that allows any number of
  clients behind NATs to communicate with a server behind a separate NAT
  with no port forwarding and no DMZ setup on any routers in order
  to directly communicate with each other. The server does not need to
  know anything about the clients trying to connect.
There is no middle man, no proxy, no 3rd party, no UPnP/STUN/ICE required, no spoofing, and no DNS tricks.
More importantly, the client can then connect to any host or port on
  any remote host or to a fixed host and port decided by the server.

pwnat establishes this kind of connection :

Machine A (IP: 192.168.1.3) -> NAT A (IP: 122.x.x.x) -> Internet ->
  NAT B (IP: 59.x.x.x) -> Machine B (192.168.2.10)

pwnat is distributed only for Linux, but the article
PWNAT: Windows Complied Version contains the Windows version.
See also, by the same author PWNAT : Example.
The method used by pwnat is unbelievably clever, but there is no guarantee that
it will work with your environment.

A:

I personally think that tunnelling is your best option, even though you don't already own a third server.
Amazon EC2 offers a Free Tier pricing option allowing new customers to run a micro instance of Linux/Windows for up to 750 hours / month, free, for one year.  I haven't used the service myself but assume that if you only run the virtual server when needed, you get an SSH tunnel up and running for free.  You might even find the service cheap enough to warrant paying for?
Hak5 produced a good introduction to tunnelling (with persistence).  You could also setup a CRON triggered script to attempt connections to the virtual server so that you have access to the laptop within minutes of starting the EC2 instance...

The best option would be set up port forwarding if you can, but if your campus does the firewalling and you can not do any port forwarding yourself then use this suggestion.

If user explicitly denied authorization for your app only you can check it like this,

       [CLLocationManager authorizationStatus] == kCLAuthorizationStatusDenied)
    {

    }

    return NO;
}

If location services are disabled in Settings,
+ (BOOL) userLocationAvailable {
    return [CLLocationManager locationServicesEnabled];
}

And I'm using it like this,
if([UserLocation userLocationAvailable]) {
    //.... Get location.
}
else
{
    if([UserLocation isLocationDisableForMyAppOnly]) {
        //... Location not available. Denied accessing location.
    }
    else{
        //... Location not available. Enable location services from settings.
    }
}

P.S. UserLocation is a custom class to get user location.

A:

Swift
Use:
CLLocationManager.authorizationStatus()

To get the authorization status. It's a CLAuthorizationStatus, you can switch on the different status' like this:
let status = CLLocationManager.authorizationStatus()
switch status {
    case .authorizedAlways:
        <#code#>
    case .authorizedWhenInUse:
        <#code#>
    case .denied:

    case .restricted:
        <#code#>
}

If this looks like a lot of work, that's because it is. But the dividends you will eventually collect are more than ample compensation.

A:

I get the impression that because my coworkers have more experience
  than me, they are getting all the good jobs, and I am left with crap
  to do - stuff which is not even vaguely programming. Meaning they are
  learning/creating more, and I am learning/creating near nothing.

How certain are you about this?  I ask as someone that generally when you are starting something new there are all kinds of learning being done that you may not realize.  How well have you gotten used to Visual Studio?  I can remember it being rather scary to learn the IDE from scratch when I first started working back in 1998 but it was an interesting time in some ways.  How well do you know the bug tracking software?  How well are you getting an idea of all the different people on the team?  There are probably more than a few things you are learning though you may not see them as big things to learn.
My advice would be to consider talking to some co-workers or your boss about seeing how well or not so well are you doing.  They may say, "Yeah, you're doing fine," or "You are awesome!" which is something you may have to accept though some may just be saying that as they are afraid to say the truth.  At the same time, recognize that this is where you find out where you stand and then do something about it.  In being there for a couple of months, you should know a few things and thus be able to do better than you did on your first week.

Its like, "fix this bug, should only take a line", and then I take
  ages just finding out where I THINK that line should go.

I've heard and said that kind of line dozens of times in my career, really.  There are a couple of different points I'd make about such a line:

It may be an estimate and so the person may have forgotten some quirky case that makes the fix be a handful of lines.  I know I've had times where I thought, "That should be done in one line of code somehow," only to later discover what I missed.
Some lines of code can be ridiculously complicated.  Ever see an if where there are dozens of brackets in it to enforce some

Q:

Golf the Lucas Lehmer Primality Test

your task is to write a program that uses the Lucas-Lehmer primality test to check whether an input number is prime or not. This prime number candidate has the form 2p-1 with p being prime. (Mersenne prime number)
The Lucas-Lehmer-test
The n-th Mersenne number is prime if it is a divisor of the (n-1)-th Lucas-Lehmer number (LLN).
You can calculate the LLN, similiar to the Fibonacci numbers, based on a recursive algorithm:
L<n> = (L<n-1>)^2 - 2

The LLN for 2 is 14. So, for p=3, LLN<3-1>=14
Evaluation

You have to submit a function that takes p as input (Remember: 2^p-1)
The shortest solution will win.
Your solution has to use the Lucas-Lehmer test
The code must be executable.
Output: boolean value or 1=prime/0=not prime

Tests:
p --> 2^p-1  --> LLN<n-1> --> ?
3 --> 7      --> 14  --> prime
5 --> 31     --> 37634 > prime (1214*31)

I want to create a chat app which would use php/codeigniter to do the views and user interface.  I've been reading lots of posts on stackoverflow which recommended node.js or socket.io.  Yet I've also run across APE(Ajax Push Engine).  I don't really know much about either and was wondering which to use.
I read up on node.js and saw lots of good things about it, but the major thing about it that worries me is that it's relatively new and doesn't have lots of real world websites testing/using it.
On the other hand, APE does.  And it looks similar to node.js.  But like I said, I don't know enough about either to know which one to choose.
Which one is better at creating a chat app?
Thanks!

A:

I played a little bit with node.js, tried out socket.io - but in the end did a big project with APE.
I think, as always, there is the question of what you want to achieve. Only comparing the server parts: With node.js you get a machine that won't do anything on it's own, you need to write it yourself (or use libraries) With APE, the handling of channels and connections is already built in (compiled C). Still you need to build parts of your own logic on top with JS - or use the examples.
On the client side, socket.io provides a client framework with three commands - and APE has it's APE_JSF that handles the connections (which brings more functionality than socket.io regarding channels)
Personally, I prefer APE, even though there is a lack of documentation for beginners. However, keep in mind that APE won't deliver files/images, it's not a full Web-Server but optimized for real time push where it can handle ~10K concurrent users

A:

Like you, I'm not familiar with APE, however socket.io on node.js comes with a chat app as it's main example app.
True, there aren't a lot of sites using Node.js right now. Socket.io, however, is probably considered Node's 'Killer App', and thus has relatively a lot of talk/work done with it.
I'm presuming APE has stable APIs, though, which socket.io might not necessarily have - The 0

Why not use GT2 en lieu of a Z-axis threaded rod or leadscrew?

Having just re-read Tom's excellent answer to my question Advantages of GT2 over a rack, as my comment ponders1:
Why is a threaded rod, or lead screw, used for the Z-axis movement in a Prusa (and its derivatives) given the inherent problems relating to backlash?
Indeed the majority of, if not all, delta printers generally use GT2 for the three vertical movements, presumably for this reason (of reduced backlash). Maybe cost and simplicity also play a part? I am purely speculating on these three reasons. The mass of the three vertical carriages and the associated carbon rods, would certainly seem to be a lot less than the mass of a cartesian X-axis gantry. 
Is it purely for reason of the mass of the X-axis gantry (especially if the extruder is mounted upon it - in a non-Bowden solution) that mechanical rods are used, as GT2 would not be able to lift the weight, without stretching (both over time and flexing slight upon each movement)? If so, then surely wire reinforced GT2 could be used?
As a potential aside, would another consideration be to compare the inertia of a GT2 solution to that of a threaded rod, leadscrew solution2?

1 I have a nagging worry that I have already asked this somewhere else, but after having spent the best part of a day looking for it and failing, I am asking here.
2 Although I am not entirely sure how that would be measured/compared, as one solution (leadscrew) is rotational, with a translation to linearal via the screw thread, and the other (GT2) is (effectively) fully rotational? I am going to ask about this particular point on SE.Mechanical Engineering, and will update this question as necessary.

A:

A lead screw can be fitted with a anti-backlash nut to get past your concern about backlash. Generally, backlash is not that of a problem considering the weight of the carriage (e.g. Prusa), or whole bed (e.g. CoreXY or Ultimaker). Certainly if you're not using Z-hop, the Z screw will only advance in a single direction!
GT2 belts are always reinforced with fibres either glass, steel or some other fibre, all with their own (dis)

mysql database are to be found in /var/lib/mysql/ManagersDatabase.
and my php pages are to be found in /var/www/html/.
It dosen't print anything. What is the wrong in my code?

A:

This is how you should be connecting, by using PDO: and utilizing prepared query's when querying.
<?php 
try{
    $con = new PDO('mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=your_database','root','password');
    $con->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
    $con->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES, false);
    $con->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_DEFAULT_FETCH_MODE,PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
}catch (Exception $e){
    die('Cannot connect to database. Details:'.$e->getMessage());
}
?>

Or mysqli and utilizing prepared query's when querying.
<?php
$con = new mysqli("127.0.0.1", "user", "password", "your_database");
if ($con->connect_errno) {
    die("Failed to connect to MySQL: (".$con->connect_errno.") ".$con->connect_error);
}
print_r($con);
?>

Edit (Reply to comment):
If you add print_r($con); you should see the mysqli connection object like:

Using Jquery to toggle the css animation

I am using sql server management studio 2012 and have to make a query to show  which subject a student has failed(condition for failing is point<5.0) the most for the first time from this table 
StudentID | SubjectID | First/Second_Time | Point.
 1        |   02      |         1         |   5.0 
 2        |   04      |         2         |   7.0
 3        |   03      |         2         |   9      
... etc

Here are my teacher's query:
SELECT SubjectID
FROM Result(NAME OF the TABLE)
WHERE [First/Second_Time] = 1 AND Point < 5
GROUP BY SubjectID
HAVING count(point) >= ALL 
(
    SELECT count(point)
    FROM Result
    WHERE [First/Second_Time] = 1 AND point < 5
    GROUP BY SubjectID
) 

I don't understand the reason for making the having query. Because Count(point) is always >=all(select count(point)
from Result
where First/Second_Time=1 and point<5
group by SubjectID), isnt it ?
and it doesn't show that the subject has most student fail for the first time. Thanks in advance and sorry for my bad english

A:

The subquery is returning a list of the number of times a subject was failed (on the first attempt).  It might be easier for you to see what it's doing if you run it like this:
SELECT SubjectID, count(point)
    FROM Result
    WHERE [First/Second_Time] = 1 AND point < 5
    GROUP BY SubjectID

So if someone failed math twice and science once, the subquery would return:
2
1

You want to know which subject was failed the most (in this case, which subject was failed 2 or more times, since that is the highest number of failures in your subquery).  So you count again (also grouping by subject), and use having to return only subjects with 2 or more failures (greater than or equal to the highest value in your subquery).  
SELECT SubjectID
FROM Result
WHERE [First/Second_Time] = 1 AND Point < 5
GROUP BY SubjectID
HAVING count(point)...

Which is near to the solution but not the exact one. It works fine for dictionaries like
{'AND': [{'column': 'XXX', 'operator': '=', 'value': 'M'}, {'column': 'XXX', 'operator': '=', 'value': 'N'}]}

OR

{'column': 'YYY', 'operator': '>', 'value': '1000'}

can you point to me a direction?

Your example

I have used Lombok in my project, but my colleague do not agree to use it, and his reason is （from controversy of lombok documents）

Both of these pieces of Project Lombok make use of non-public APIs to accomplish their sorcery. This means that there is a risk that Project Lombok will be broken with subsequent IDE or JDK releases. 

But it's a very old document written in 2010, maybe now it has resolved the problem, so I want to know if Lombok will support Java 9 and does it still use the non-public API:s?

A:

The Lombok project has an issue tracking Java 9 support. As of January 9th 2018 and version 1.16.20, Lombok officially supports Java 9. From the changelog:

PLATFORM: Better support for jdk9 in the new IntelliJ, Netbeans and for Gradle.
BREAKING CHANGE: lombok config key lombok.addJavaxGeneratedAnnotation now defaults to false instead of true. Oracle broke this annotation with the release of JDK9, necessitating this breaking change.
BREAKING CHANGE: lombok config key lombok.anyConstructor.suppressConstructorProperties is now deprecated and defaults to true, that is, by default lombok no longer automatically generates @ConstructorProperties annotations. New config key lombok.anyConstructor.addConstructorProperties now exists; set it to true if you want the old behavior. Oracle more or less broke this annotation with the release of JDK9, necessitating this breaking change.
DEVELOPMENT: Compiling lombok on JDK1.9 is now possible.

(At the moment, it is no module, though, so you need to place it on the class path. Thanks Tos' answer, which first mentioned this.)

A:

The current status of lombok for Java 9 is tracked here: https://github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok/issues/985
As of right now this bug is still open and (apparently) actively being worked on. There is an edge release out there that solves most of the issues so at this point it looks like all you need to do is wait..

A:

The issue appears to be resolved since 9 January 2018: https://github.com/rzwitserloot

        final Runnable requestThree = () -> {
            try {
                userRepo.lockUser(1L, false);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            }
        };

        final Thread threadOne = new Thread(requestOne);
        threadOne.start();

        Thread.sleep(1000); // give the first one some time to start

        final Thread threadTwo = new Thread(requestTwo);
        threadTwo.start();
        final Thread threadThree = new Thread(requestThree);
        threadThree.start();

        Thread.sleep(20000); // wait before destroying context
    }

}

If we now assume there is an Entity of type User with the id 1 (Long) the output is:
Thread 16 EXECUTES SELECT FOR UPDATE
Hibernate: select user0_.id as id1_31_0_, user0_.player_balance as player_b2_31_0_ from "user" user0_ where user0_.id=? for update
Thread 16 started blocking!
Thread 17 EXECUTES SELECT FOR UPDATE
Hibernate: select user0_.id as id1_31_0_, user0_.player_balance as player_b2_31_0_ from "user" user0_ where user0_.id=? for update
Thread 18 EXECUTES SELECT FOR UPDATE
Hibernate: select user0_.id as id1_31_0_, user0_.player_balance as player_b2_31_0_ from "user" user0_ where user0_.id=? for update
Thread 16 finished blocking!
Thread 16 FINISHED QUERY
Thread 17 FINISHED QUERY
Thread 18 FINISHED QUERY

So all following executions of this query wait for the first one (because of the SELECT ... FOR UPDATE) after calling entityManager.find(... LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_WRITE...);, the entityManager.lock(...) call is not needed.
The missing exception could be caused by the fact that the query timeout is just a hint and is maybe not considered by your database. See the docs.

QueryTimeoutException: the query takes longer than the specified timeout (see javax.persistence.query.timeout - this property is a hint and might not be followed)

Q:

Push NuGet Package to Artifactory local repo subfolder

I have set up a local NuGet Repository as described here. The apikey is set and authentication is also set in the NuGet.Config file.
To push a nupkg directly into this folder, there is no problem:
nuget push Nuget.0.1.15.nupkg -Source http://arti.url/artifactory/api/nuget/nuget-repo-local

But as soon as I try to push it to a subfolder to have kind of a nice layout in Artifactory, this fails:
nuget push Nuget.0.1.15.nupkg -Source http://arti.url/artifactory/api/nuget/nuget-repo-local/aFolder

Is this a known problem, does anybody have a solution to this? Creating an apikey for every folder is not really what I am looking for...
The warning is as follows:
WARNING: No API Key was provided and no API Key could be found for 'http://arti.url/artifactory/api/nuget/nuget-repo-local/aFolder'. 
To save an API Key for a source use the 'setApiKey' command.

And the error says then:
Failed to process request. 'Forbidden'. 
The remote server returned an error: (403) Forbidden..

A:

When you do :
nuget push Nuget.0.1.15.nupkg -Source http://arti.url/artifactory/api/nuget/nuget-repo-local/aFolder

nuget intrpret the whole url as the repo address (the client implementation is based on flat deployment where Artifactory is more flexible)
Regarding your deployment on root repo I assume you followed the indication and ran the setApiKey command first on the repo :
nuget setapikey <USERNAME>:<PASSWORD> -Source http://arti.url/artifactory/api/nuget/nuget-repo-local

this allow you to push without entering your credentials each time but only at root level.
Now if you want to push on subfolder you can set the apikey on it as you did for the rpo itself :
nuget set

I'm selecting an id from an Linq query so it is an int but when i try to use it again it is giving me the error:

Cannot implicitly convert type
  'System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable to 'int'

var costcentre = company.CompanyCostCentres
    .Where(cc => cc.Name.ToLower() == CostCentre.ToLower())
    .Select(cid => cid.CompanyCostCentreId)
    .ToList();

if (costcentre != null)
{
    person.PersonInCompanyCostCentres.Add(new Core.Data.PersonInCompanyCostCentre    
    { 
        CompanyCostCentreId = costcentre, 
        UserId = person.UserId, 
        CompanyId = company.CompanyId, 
        RecordCreated = DateTime.Now, 
        RecordModified = DateTime.Now 
    });
}

A:

To get the first int from the list of id's, use
var costcentres = company.CompanyCostCentres.Where(cc => cc.Name.ToLower() == CostCentre.ToLower()).Select(cid => cid.CompanyCostCentreId);

int costcentre= costcentres.FirstOrDefault();

A:

Problem:
var costcentre = company.CompanyCostCentres.Where(cc => cc.Name.ToLower() == 
CostCentre.ToLower()).Select(cid => cid.CompanyCostCentreId).ToList();

Returns a list.
CompanyCostCentreId = costcentre

Tries to assign the list to int
Solution:
If cid.CompanyCostCentreId is int
change
var costcentre = company.CompanyCostCentres.Where(cc => cc.Name.ToLower() == 
CostCentre.ToLower()).Select(cid => cid.CompanyCostCentreId).ToList();

to
var costcentre = company.CompanyCostCentres.Where(cc => cc.Name.ToLower() == 
CostCentre.ToLower()).Select(cid => cid.CompanyCostCentreId).FirstOrDefault();

Then you should handle the possibility that costcentre become a 0 if no result is given.

yields

    uList.appendChild(li1);
    uList.appendChild(li2);

    var t1 = document.createElement("div");
    var t2 = document.createElement("div");

    t1.id = "tabs-1";
    t2.id = "tabs-2";

    t1.innerHTML = "Tab1";
    t2.innerHTML = "Tab2";

    tabsContainer.appendChild(uList);
    tabsContainer.appendChild(t1);

Use Sqrt[z^2] instead of Abs[z]:

D[Sqrt[z^2], z]

z/Sqrt[z^2]

Use complex (Wirtinger) derivatives. Summarizing:

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial z} = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x} - i \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right), \quad\frac{\partial}{\partial \bar{z}} = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + i \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)$$
This means that the "real" derivative, i.e., the derivative with respect to $x$ only, is given by:
$$\frac{\partial}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial}{\partial z} + \frac{\partial}{\partial \bar{z}}$$
Hence the "real" derivative of Abs[z] is:
$$\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left| z \right| = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \sqrt{z \bar{z}} = \frac{z + \bar{z}}{2 \left| z \right|} = \frac{\Re{z}}{\left| z \right|}$$
which agrees with the previous answer when $z$ is real.
However, this exposition is not useful without an actual implementation of Wirtinger derivatives! On the other hand, in this answer I give such an implementation, and the function is called ComplexD (I provide its definition at the end of this answer). So:
ComplexD[Abs[z], z] + ComplexD[Abs[z], Conjugate[z]]
% //FullSimplify

z/(2 Abs[z]) + Conjugate[z]/(2 Abs[z])
Re[z]/Abs[z]

in agreement with the above results. It would be possible to define a RealD function:
RealD[expr_, z_] := ComplexD[expr, z] + ComplexD[expr, Conjugate[z]]

if one were so inclined. Here is the definition of ComplexD (slightly edited from the original):
ComplexD[expr_, z__] := With[
    {
    nc = NonConstants -> Union @ Cases[{z},
        s_Symbol | Conjugate

I have started to explore the new XCTest APIs for asynchronous and performance testing. In isolation, the Apple examples from WWMC work well, but I have been unable to figure out how to combine them. The best I have been able to come up with is the following, but I receive the following error when it runs: 
API violation - call made to wait without any expectations having been set. 
XCTestExpectation *clsQueryReturnedExpectation = [self expectationWithDescription:@"clsQuery returned"];

PFCLSClient *theClient = [[PFCLSClient alloc] init];

[self measureMetrics:@[XCTPerformanceMetric_WallClockTime] automaticallyStartMeasuring:YES forBlock: ^{
   [theClient getStructureOfType:clsImageTypeSVG ForID:idString success: ^(NSDictionary *structureInfo) {
       [clsQueryReturnedExpectation fulfill];
} failure: ^(NSError *error) {
       XCTFail();
       [clsQueryReturnedExpectation fulfill];
}];

   [self waitForExpectationsWithTimeout:5 handler: ^(NSError *error) {
        [self stopMeasuring];
   }];
}];

Has anyone been able to accomplish something similar?
Thx 

A:

With some help from Apple, I have a solution. Silly oversight on my part as this is very easy to solve. To get to work, all you need to do is put the creating of the expectation object (clsQueryReturnedExpectation) inside the measureMetrics block so it is created afresh each time the performance test is run.
PFCLSClient *theClient = [[PFCLSClient alloc] init];

[self measureMetrics:@[XCTPerformanceMetric_WallClockTime] automaticallyStartMeasuring:YES forBlock: ^{
    XCTestExpectation *clsQueryReturnedExpectation = [self expectationWithDescription:@"clsQuery returned"];  
    [theClient getStructureOfType:clsImageTypeSVG ForID:idString success: ^(NSDictionary *structureInfo) {
       [clsQueryReturnedExpectation fulfill];
    } failure: ^(NSError *error) {
       XCTFail();
       [clsQueryReturnedExpectation fulfill];
    }];



How to get a boolean state from a fragment to an activity?

I have an activity that is the foundation of 2 fragments. The activity chooses which fragment to show based on a boolean. Currently, I have set the boolean state individually to the activity and the fragments like so:
Activity:
    public boolean setupCompleted = false;

@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        {...}     

    if (setupCompleted){
        setFragment(programFragment);
    } else {
        setFragment(setupFragment);
    }

}

setupFragment:
   public boolean setupCompleted = false;

public SetupFragment() {
    // Required empty public constructor
}

@Override
public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,
                         Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.setup, container, false);

    pButton = view.findViewById(R.id.pButton);

    pButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
        @Override
        public void onClick(View v) {
            setupCompleted = true;
            Toast.makeText(getActivity(), "Boolean state changed to True!", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
        }
    });

    return view;
}

The architecture is simple, The Activity starts and shows the setupFragment right away, but when you complete the setup the Activity will show the programFragment.
Now my problem lies in the fact that I want the button to change the boolean to true so that the main Activity can show the programFragment but I was not able to find any simple explanation on the internet in how to get the boolean state from the setupFragment.
Later I will save the instance state so that the setupFragment never shows again to a user that already completed the setup.

A:

For this scenario you need to communicate between Activity and Fragment.
You can do that via Interface . Define a Interface in Fragment
    // Container Activity must implement this interface
public interface OnChnageEvent {
    public void updateCompletedStatus(int value);
}

In Fragment :
@Override
public void onAttach(Activity activity) {
    super.onAttach(activity);

    // This makes sure that the container activity has implemented
    // the callback interface.

moment().startOf('minute');  // set to now, but with 0 seconds and 0 milliseconds

Here a working sample:

$('#datetimepicker1').datetimepicker({
  locale: 'fr'
});
          
// Sends epoch (unix time) into epoch-start-time form
$('#datetimepicker1').on(`dp.change`, X =>
$('#epoch-start-time').val(X.date.startOf('minute').unix()));

Q:

Keep a subset of user details secure across multiple pages using javascript

I'm not certain it's even possible, but is there a way to keep user information secure across multiple pages while only using javascript?
I have a predefined set of details recovered from three separate API requests, initial call sends user credentials to the login_api via a POST and returns a small set of data (OAuth2 token, user birth name, etc.), the ensuing calls fire, upon success, for 2 lanes of products via GET calls, these requests return a list of products for each lane which is perceived as what this user is licensed to view.
I've not had a great deal of experience in setting up secure user authentication and remembered data across a multi-paged website so I want to ensure I am taking the proper approach.
With the functions below I can create _private variables inside of functions that utilize that data.
All remembered data is applied within the XHR responses to the cookie storage area, it never leaves the scope of the request function. 
From that point forward all data is retrieved via cookies, used within a singular function scope, never leaving the scope of the function it is utilized in. Each time the data is required it is re-fetched from the cookies. I'm not certain how secure cookies are, I debated clearing cookies each time the data is recovered and re-applying updated values upon the function's completion, but thought it overkill.
If any piece of relevant cookie data is not present on page load they're redirected to the login page and all relevant cookie data, if present, is removed.
Is there any way to improve retaining an OAuth2 token and handful of user details across multiple pages without leaking user information with only javascript? 
NOTE
This is within a rather old internal website and in keeping things familiar for the team we're using ES5 and below, it's moving away from internal use only.
var config = Object.create(null);
config.expire_item = 30; // minutes

function dataref() {

  // setup objects to store details in
  var output;
  output = Object.create(null);
  output.access = Object.create(null);
  output.licensed = Object.create(null);
  output.token = "_token"; 

  // apply predefined names as object values
  // cookies in this namespace holds user name
  output.

How can I transpose the 3d list m4c so that I get the desired output?
m4c = [[['A ', '  ', '  ', '  ', '  ', '  ', '  ', '  '], ['B ', '  ', '  ', '  '], ['C ', '  ', '  ', '  ', '  ', '  ', '  ', '  \n']],    [['E ', 'F#', 'E ', 'E ', 'F#', 'E ', '  ', 'E '], ['E ', 'F#', 'E ', 'E '], ['E ', 'F#', 'E ', 'E ', 'F#', '  ', 'E ', 'F#']]]

desired output:
[[['A ','E '], ['  ','F#'], ['  ','E '], ['  ','E '], ['  ','F#'], ['  ','E '], ['  ','  '], ['  ','E ']], 
 [['B ','E '], ['  ','F#'], ['  ','E '], ['  ','E ']],
 [['C ','E '], ['  ','F#'], ['  ','E '], ['  ','E '], ['  ','F#'], ['  ','E '], ['  ','  '], ['  ','E ']]]

A:

I don't know if your m4c[0][2] is correct:['C ', '  ', '  ', '  ', '  ', '  ', '  ', '  \n'], but if it and tuple is OK for you, then a simple solution can be:
>>> [zip(m4c[0][i], m4c[1][i]) for i in range(len(m4c[0]))]
[[('A ', 'E '), ('  ', 'F#'), ('  ', 'E '), ('  ', 'E '), ('  ', 'F#'), ('  ', 'E '), ('  ', '  '), ('  ', 'E ')],\
 [('B ', 'E '), ('  ', 'F#'), ('  ', 'E '), ('  ', 'E ')], \
 [('C ', 'E '), ('  ', 'F#'), ('  ', 'E '), ('  ', 'E '

A:

Let me get this straight.  You connected something rated for 6 V to something that produces 12 V, and you're actually surprised something went wrong!!?  You are trying to cram 20 pounds of stuff into a 10 pound bag.  It doesn't take a degree in engineering or much sense at all to expect this not to work out.
The 12 V supply can put out up to 800 mA.  Apparently your heater draws more than that when connected to 12 V.  This type of heater is basically just a resistor.  For it to only draw 800 mA at 12 V, it would need to draw only 400 mA at 6 V.  That means it would be rated as (6 V)(400 mA)= 2.4 W or less at 6 V.  If it is rated at higher power than that, then it will draw more current than 400 mA at 6 V or 800 mA at 12 V and your 12 V supply can't handle it.
Apparently your 12 V supply has a shutdown feature so that it goes to 0 V when you try to abuse it, as you did.  It may periodically try to raise the voltage for a short time, discover the current is still too high, and go back into shutdown.  These attempts to recover would be short blips maybe every second or two, so you'd still see 0 V on a meter measuring the output.
Fortunately for you, all that happened was that the supply shut down.  If you had connected the heater to a 12 V source with more current capability, like a car battery for example, the heater would have to give instead of the supply.  Again, ceramic heaters are basically just resistors with fancy marketing, and generally don't come with any protection circuitry.  The 2x voltage would cause 4x the power dissipation, which would very likely be destructive to the heater within a few seconds.
The 4 AA batteries work with the heater because they are running it within spec.  At roughly 1.5 V per cell, they make 6 V, which is what the heater is designed to operate at.  This again should be no surprise.
There are ways to take 12 VDC at some current and make 6 VDC at not quite twice the current.  A circuit for this is called a buck converter, but that is above your level of electronics at this point.  Nothing called a "transformer" will work since those inherently run on AC, not DC.

Q:

How to wait for SQL Server replication reinitialization via TSQL

We use transaction and push replication. Every night after the data import 2 replication targets are initialized with the following commands.
USE [dbImport]

-- Execute at the Publisher to reinitialize the push subscription.
EXEC sp_reinitsubscription 
@subscriber = N'Target2',
@destination_db = N'dbImport',
@publication = N'dbImportPub';
GO

-- Start the Distribution Agent.
USE msdb
EXEC sp_start_job @job_name = 'Source1-dbImport-dbImport-Pub-Target2-35'
GO

The next step waits for 15 minutes because this reinitialization needs to take normally 10 minutes and we add some more time to be on the safer side.
Sometimes the reinitialization needs a little bit longer than 15 minutes, so the indexes which are created in next step on target aren't correct.
I can't check for stopping of the distibution job because in transaction replication it never stops.
How can I wait for the end of reinitialization (initial push of all scripts and data) on target2 (to afterwards add the indexes "on time")?
Stefan

A:

Since I don't like to have "unrequired" jobs and want to handle things on a simple way I've created another solution.
The following code is used in a job step after the replication is initialized and started on subscriber with associated job name with postfix "-59".
WHILE 0 = (SELECT COUNT(1) FROM distribution.dbo.MSdistribution_history
-- search for suffix of the SQL-job, here '59'
WHERE (agent_id = 59) 

  -- the following text appears in the table once the snapshot-transfer is complete
  AND (comments LIKE N'%The snapshot in subfolder% was transfered in % milliseconds%')      

  -- here I search for the last start time of our import job
  AND (time > (SELECT ja.start_execution_date      
  FROM msdb.dbo.sysjobactivity ja 
  LEFT JOIN msdb.dbo.sysjobhistory jh ON ja.job_history_id = jh.instance_id
  JOIN msdb.dbo.sysjobs j ON ja.job_

Why stdin of parent process still accepts inputs after closing stdin file descriptor from a forked child process?

fork(2) manual page on the Linux system I'm running says the following:

The child inherits copies of the parent's set of open file descriptors.  Each file descriptor in the  child  refers  to  the  same  open file description (see open(2)) as the corresponding file descriptor in the parent.  This means that the two  file  descriptors  share  open  file  status flags, file offset, and signal-driven I/O attributes (see the description of F_SETOWN and F_SET‐SIG in fcntl(2)).

And Python Documentation mentions

_exit() should normally only be used in the child process after a fork().

Of course, _exit won't call cleanup handlers, the problem is that, if you look at this code for instance:
newpid = os.fork()
if newpid == 0:
    os.close(0)
else:
    time.sleep(.25)
    input()

The parent process still accepts inputs from stdin despite the fact the child process closes stdin. That's good and here's the code reversed:
newpid = os.fork()
if newpid == 0:
    input()
else:
    time.sleep(.25)
    os.close(0)

Now, it's the opposite, this time the parent process that closes stdin not the child. And this raises EOFError for the input() call in the child process.
This looks like when the [child] process writes/modifies the parent's file descriptors, it does not affect the [parent]. That is, the child process gets newer file descriptions.
Then why call _exit as Python Docs states to prevent invoking cleanup handlers if operations performed by the child process does not affect the parent process? Let's take a look at _EXIT(2) man page:

The function _exit() terminates the calling process "immediately". Any open file descriptors belonging to the process are closed; any children of the process are inherited by process 1, init, and the process's parent is sent a SIGCHLD`  signal.
The function _exit() is like exit(3), but does not call any functions registered with atexit(3) or on

string.format throws exception in http post request and response

I would like to have a method for placing format specifiers (like %s) instead of placing hard code values, you can find my code bellow;
String userName = "Nicole";
    String password = "Nicole";

    HttpClient client = new DefaultHttpClient();

    HttpPost post = new HttpPost("url");

    String input=String.format("<soap:Envelope 

    xmlns:soap=\"http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope\" xmlns:inn=\"http:Innovation/\">

    <soap:Header/><soap:Body><inn:getCategoriesbyVendorID><!--Optional:-->

    <userName>%s</userName><!--Optional:--><password>%s</password></inn:getCategoriesbyVendorID>

    </soap:Body></soap:Envelope>",userName,password);

        //StringEntity input = new StringEntity("<soap:Envelope 

    xmlns:soap=\"http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope\" xmlns:inn=\"http:Innovation/\">

    <soap:Header/><soap:Body><inn:getCategoriesbyVendorID><!--Optional:-->

    <userName>Nicole</userName><!--Optional:--><password>Nicole</password>

    </inn:getCategoriesbyVendorID></soap:Body></soap:Envelope>");  

        post.setEntity(input);

        HttpResponse response = client.execute(post);

        BufferedReader rd = new BufferedReader(new 

    InputStreamReader(response.getEntity().getContent()));

        String line = "";

        while ((line = rd.readLine()) != null) {

        System.out.println(line);

With the code above, the Entity throws an error. Could anybody help me solve this issue?

A:

There is nothing wrong with your syntax of String formatting.

It is showing an error in eclipse i e.,change type of input to HTTP
  entity(post. set Entity(input);).

The error is because HttpPost.setEntity expects a parameter of type HttpEntity while you are specifying the type of String to it.

Q:

Replacing text with hyperlink microsoft word

I have a word document that we are using as a template and am trying to find a way in C# to search for specific text and replace it with a hyperlink. for example:
[FacebookPage1] would be replaced with Facebook and when clicked would take them to the facebook page. We have over 100 different links to cycle through and replace so I need to automate it. I have found ways to replace text with other text but have not found a way to replace text with a hyperlink. Is this possible?

A:

Here is something that you can try out. Let's say you have something like the following content in your template document:

Social media: [FacebookPage1] | [TwitterPage1] | [GooglePlusPage1] | [LinkedInPage1]

In that case you can use the following to replace those placeholders with hyperlinks:
// Create collection of "placeholder -> link" pairs.
var linkData = new Dictionary<string, string>()
{
    ["FacebookPage1"] = "https://www.facebook.com",
    ["TwitterPage1"] = "https://twitter.com",
    ["GooglePlusPage1"] = "https://plus.google.com",
    ["LinkedInPage1"] = "https://www.linkedin.com"
};

// Create placeholder regex, the pattern for texts between square brackets.
Regex placeholderRegex = new Regex(@"\[(.*?)\]", RegexOptions.Compiled);

// Load template document.
DocumentModel document = DocumentModel.Load("Template.docx");

// Search for placeholders in the document.
foreach (ContentRange placeholder in document.Content.Find(placeholderRegex).Reverse())
{
    string name = placeholder.ToString().Trim('[', ']');
    string link;

    // Replace placeholder with Hyperlink element.
    if (linkData.TryGetValue(name, out link))
        placeholder.Set(new Hyperlink(document, link, name).Content);
}

// Save document.
document.Save("Output.docx");

The following is the resulting "Output.docx" file:

Note that the above code uses GemBox.Document for manipulating with DOCX file, it has a Free and Professional

Raised when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be represented. This cannot occur for long integers [...] and for most operations with plain integers, which return a long integer instead. [...]

This mean that integers should never throw this exception; the cause of this exception is the range() with too many items, so I suppose that also 10**15 will throw the same exception but I got a different one...
MemoryError:

Raised when an operation runs out of memory but the situation may still be rescued (by deleting some objects). [...]

Which object should I delete to rescue this situation? It simply exit, so the situation cannot be rescued...
And if it feels that there's too much ram usage, why it freezes my pc with 10**9?

Finally, my question is: 
Why I'm getting 3 different result, only depending on the value stored in the x variable?

NOTE:

I know the existence of xrange, that hasn't this problem, but my question is about range.
I think that the values used to throw the exception may change, depending on your hardware.
My Python version: 2.7.6.

A:

Well, range tries to build an entire list with as many items as x.
For the instant-swap-of-the-death case, you can estimate that, assuming 64 bits and a fixed 8 byte integer, x = 10**9 is worth about 8 Go. So if you have no more than that (take into account already used RAM) you can see why the system swap.
Going further down, a MemoryError is probably raised if the function could not allocate a chunk big enough to hold the result (which in the case of 10**15 seems quite big).
I don't know the implementation detail of range but it might be using the OverflowError to ensure an absolute maximum number of elements (maybe in a way to prevent MemoryError, based on real available memory).
As mentioned in the comment by @ShadowRanger, an OverflowError is raised if the length of the result cannot fit into a size_t variable (2**31 (32 bit) or 2**63 (64 bit)) as it cannot initialize such a list.
As you mentioned, xrange does not have this issue because it does not generate the entire list but generates a single value each time you iterate it. That why iterator/generator are memory efficient.



Q:

Why does the file async API block

I am writing a simple metro app. However, the API blocks when accessing files. By blocking, I mean the programs waits forever. Creating/opening a file or folder should take at most a few seconds. In this case, it takes forever.
When I run the program, it never comes back from OnTest. Is it what you get.
I understand .Wait will wait for the creation of files and folders to finishe. Maybe that's not great design. However, that's not the point.
My question is:

Do you get the same behavior (blocks the program forever)
Is it what's supposed to happen or is it a bug in WinRT? (I am using the consumer preview)
If that's the expected behavior, why does it take forever?

Here is the XAML code:
<Button Click="OnTest">Test</Button>

Here is the C# code:
 private async void OnTest(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
        {
            var t = new Cache("test1");
            t = new Cache("test2");
            t = new Cache("test3");
        }
        class Cache
        {
            public Cache(string name)
            {
                TestRetrieve(name).Wait();
            }
            public static async Task TestRetrieve(string name) 
            {
                StorageFolder rootFolder = ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder;
                var _folder = await rootFolder.CreateFolderAsync(name, CreationCollisionOption.OpenIfExists);
                var file = await _folder.CreateFileAsync("test.xml", CreationCollisionOption.OpenIfExists);
            }
        }

It blocks on the second call to new Cache("test2");

A:

I have not attempted to run your program or reproduce your problem, but I can make an educated guess as to what is going on.
Suppose you wrote yourself the following to-do list:

Put a letter to mom in the mailbox.
Set the alarm to wake me up as soon as I've read her reply.
Go to sleep.
Check the mailbox for the reply.
Read the reply.

Now do everything on that list strictly in order from top to bottom. What happens?
The problem is not with the post

Now postcodes, the lowest is 2189 and the highest is 2211, then each case will change to [2189 - 2198].
For age, the lowest is 18 and the highest is 62, so it will be [25-54]

    }
    return Lk;
}
# endregion----- Apriori-gen

Now I know of the Apriori Gen process where we make itemsets into larger item sets by joining them together. But I can't see how this is implemented in the previous code. Why did we use temp? How do isExists and isContained help us? What's going on exactly in these two parts of code?

A:

First, there is two loops:
for (int i = 0 ; i 

These loops are used to compare each pairs of itemsets of a given size together.  The first thing that I notice about this Apriori implementation is that it is not efficient because if the itemsets are lexically ordered, then you don't need to compare each itemset with each other. You can stop earlier. But this code does not have this optimization.
The second big problem that I see with this code is that the candidates are stored as Strings. It would be much more efficient to store it as an array of Integers. Storing the itemset as String including ","  and spliting them to separate numbers is a very bad design decision, that will waste memory and execution time.  For a data mining algorithm, the implementation should be as efficient as possible.  In my opinion, this means that the code that you are looking at has been written by a novice.

$$ \bar{\lambda} = -\frac{a'(t) \cdot w'(t)}{w'(t) \cdot w'(t)}$$
for a given $t$. I just don't know how to prove this.

EDIT 2: Based on robjohn's answer below, I've got the following:
Let $t_1$ and $t_2 = t_1 + \Delta t$ be two nearby values of the parameter $t$, corresponding to two lines $L_1$ and $L_2$.
The perpendicular that joins $L_1$ and $L_2$ has the direction $w_1 \times w_2$, and the plane containing $L_2$ and the perpendicular therefore has the normal
$$w_2 \times (w_1 \times w_2)$$
which means that, for any point $x$ in the plane, we get
$$(x - a_2) \cdot (w_2 \times (w_1 \times w_2)) = 0$$
We need to find the point $a_1 + \bar{\lambda} w_1$ at which $L_1$ intersects this plane, therefore
$$(a_1 + \bar{\lambda} w_1 - a_2) \cdot (w_2 \times (w_1 \times w_2)) = 0$$
or
$$\bar{\lambda} = \frac{(a_2 - a_1) \cdot (w_2 \times (w_1 \times w_2))}{\Vert   w_1 \times w_2 \Vert^2}$$
This yields $\bar{\lambda}$ for any finite displacement $\Delta t = t_2 - t_1$. For $\Delta t \rightarrow 0$, the expression gets indeterminate (because $w_2 \rightarrow w_1$ implies $w_1 \times w_2 \rightarrow 0$)...
I believe I am close, but I don't see how to obtain the correct limit from this.

Consider the map $$\phi:(t,s)\mapsto a

If something is unclear please let me know.
Thanks in advance for any help.
EDIT:
I can't seem to get it working with the help i already got. I was able to edit the method a little bit with the help from replys i already got:
    int locationControl = 78;
    DataClasses1DataContext dc = new DataClasses1DataContext();

    public List<Control> LoadKPIs(Table<GTMD_Financial> dbTable)
    {
        var controls = new List<Control>();            

        dbTable.ToList().ForEach(x =>
        {
            KPIEntrys uc = new KPIEntrys();

            uc.KPI = x.KPI;
            uc.Status = x.Status.ToString();
            uc.Goal = x.Goal.ToString();
            uc.Currently = x.Currently.ToString();
            uc.ShowAction = (bool)x.ShowAction;
            uc.ShowStats = (bool)x.ShowStats;
            uc.StatusGood = x.Status < x.StatusSignal;
            uc.Location = new Point(21, locationControl);

            controls.Add(uc);

            locationControl = locationControl + 34;
        }
        );
        return controls;
    }

So let me rephrase my question: How can i change the class when i call the method: LoadKPIs(Table<GTMD_Financial> dbTable? So GTMD_Finacial changes.

A:

Write an interface which defines all the properties you want to use, and implement that on the business entities that you want to use.
public interface IMyReusableInterface {
    string KPI { get; set; }
    string Status { get; set; }
    // etc...
}

public partial GTMD_Financials: IMyReusableInterface {
}

Now you can write a reusable method which accepts a list of objects which implement that interface.
public List<Control> MyReusableMethod (List<IMyReusableInterface> data) {
    int locationControl = 78;
    var controls = new List<Control>();

    foreach (var x in data) {
        KPIEntrys uc = new KPIEntrys();         // UserControl

        uc.

A:

Given that your closure doesn't specify nullability qualifiers (where they almost certainly are optional), one can safely assume that your Objective-C API has not been audited for nullability. Thus, Swift will treat pointers as implicitly unwrapped optionals. Furthermore, nowadays the NSDictionary is mapped to a [NSObject : AnyObject] Swift dictionary.
Thus, it would be:
obj.objcMethod(param) { (success: Bool, result: [NSObject : AnyObject]!, error: NSError!) in
    if success {
        // do something
    }
}

Or, as Kobi points out, you can let the compiler infer the types:
obj.objcMethod(param) { success, result, error in
    if success {
        // do something
    }
}

Note, you don't have to remember this yourself. You can leverage Xcode's code completion as you enter the code. So, type enough to match the method name and when it matches objcMethod, then hit enter:

When you get to MYCompletionBlock, hit enter again, and it will show you the correct signature:

If this Objective-C method was my own class, I would audit it for nullability. So, for example, let's assume the param is optional, the closure is required, and the result and error were optional, you might define it like so:
NS_ASSUME_NONNULL_BEGIN

typedef void (^MYCompletionBlock)(BOOL success, NSDictionary * _Nullable result, NSError * _Nullable error);

@interface MyObject : NSObject

- (void)objcMethod:(NSDictionary * _Nullable)param1 withCompletionHandler:(MYCompletionBlock)completionHandler;

@end

NS_ASSUME_NONNULL_END

And, if that was the case, your Swift code would call it like so:
obj.objcMethod(param) { (success: Bool, result: [NSObject : AnyObject]?, error: NSError?) in
    if success {
        // do something
    }
}

Or, again, just let the compiler infer the types for you (but this time they'd be inferred as optionals that are not implicitly unwrapped):
obj.objcMethod(param) { success, result

I'm running a django app using twisted. I moved now from http to https. How can I add redirects from http to https in twisted?

A:

To redirect from any given path on HTTP to the same path on the HTTPS
(based on Jean-Paul's suggestions in response to my comment):
from twisted.python import urlpath
from twisted.web import resource, util

class RedirectToScheme(resource.Resource):
    """
    I redirect to the same path at a given URL scheme
    @param newScheme: scheme to redirect to (e.g. https)
    """

    isLeaf = 0

    def __init__(self, newScheme):
        resource.Resource.__init__(self)
        self.newScheme = newScheme

    def render(self, request):
        newURLPath = request.URLPath()
        # TODO Double check that == gives the correct behaviour here
        if newURLPath.scheme == self.newScheme:  
            raise ValueError("Redirect loop: we're trying to redirect to the same URL scheme in the request")
        newURLPath.scheme = self.newScheme
        return util.redirectTo(newURLPath, request)

    def getChild(self, name, request):
        return self

Then you can use RedirectToScheme("https"), in place of your Site() for the HTTP site that you want to redirect from.
Note: If the HTTP that you want to redirect from is on a non-standard port, you will probably have a :<port> part in the the URLRequest that you'll also need to rewrite.

A:

An easy way to generate redirects in Twisted Web is is with the Redirect resource.  Instantiate it with a URL and put it into your resource hierarchy.  If it is rendered, it will return a redirect response to that URL:
from twisted.web.util import Redirect
from twisted.web.resource import Resource
from twisted.web.server import Site
from twisted.internet import reactor

root = Resource()
root.putChild("foo", Redirect("https://stackoverflow.com/"))

reactor.listenTCP(8080, Site(root))
reactor.run()

This will run a server which responds to a request for http://localhost:8080

SIP and EC2 elastic IPs

I'm trying to make a custom SIP software work on an EC2 instance. My software at the moment doesn't have NAT handling capabilities, and I was wondering If I could get it to work transparently with the public (elastic) IP associated to the EC2 instance.
Here's the output of "iconfig -a" run on my EC2 box:
eth0 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr XXXXXX
inet addr: PRIVATE-IP-ADDRESS Bcast:10.48.195.255 Mask:255.255.254.0

TX packets:78 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
collisions:0 txqueuelen:0
RX bytes:6892 (6.7 KiB) TX bytes:6892 (6.7 KiB)
Is there a way to change this so that my application can transparently open a UDP socket on the PUBLIC (elastic) IP address? And basically work as if the public IP was normally assigned to eth0.
I thought about using iptables DNAT/SNAT or adding the IP address manually, but no success so far. 

A:

The answer is no. There is no good way to get a SIP server application to work transparently on the internet when it's using a private IP address. The server application needs to know both its public IP address and the fact that it should use that IP address in preference to the private one. SIP requires inserting the public

Q:

Sentiment analysis api/tool, for Java

I'm writing a Java program and need to analyze small chunks of text (3-4 sentences, news articles paraphrased) for their sentiment. I just need to know whether the article is generally positive, negative or neutral.
For example, the following would ideally be classed as positive:

Kindle e-book sales soar for Amazon.
  Amazon.com says it is selling more
  e-books for its Kindle electronic
  reading device than paperback and
  hardback print editions combined

All I need is a very simple and quick to implement third party solution, that I can use in my program. It does not have to be totally accurate all the time. Licenses etc. are not an issue, so long as it is possible to trail the solution.
So far I have found a potential good solution, AlchemyAPI, but am struggling to actually use it.

If anyone has encountered this problem before and knows of a particularly good/easy solution, or of a really good tutorial, I would be very grateful :-)

(Also I apologize for the lack of code in this question.)

A:

i just tested AlchemyAPI. it's not 100% accurate but i guess this sort of technology is still in its infancy.
you will need to register (free) to get an api key.
here's a sample usage: http://access.alchemyapi.com/calls/text/TextGetTextSentiment?apikey=<insert your api key>&sentiment=1&showSourceText=1&text=Kindle%20e-book%20sales%20soar%20for%20Amazon.%20Amazon.com%20says%20it%20is%20selling%20more%20e-books%20for%20its%20Kindle%20electronic%20reading%20device%20than%20paperback%20and%20hardback%20print%20editions%20combined
the inputs are:

sentiment=1
showSourceText=1
text (i used your sample text, uri encoded)

i got the following output (neutral sentiment, instead of the expected positive sentiment):
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<results>    
    <status>OK</status>

How can I expand a relative path at the command line, with tab completion?

In bash is there any way to expand a relative path into an absolute path, perhaps with tab completion?
I ask because sometimes I will search for a file, find it, then vim it:
cd /etc
cd apache2
cd sites-available
vim 000-default

Then I will do some other things and change directories:
cd /tmp
ls
cd ~
ls

Then I'll find that I need to edit the same file again, but it is not possible to use history, (or history search), because the file path is relative.
Current Workaround
If I know I'm going to be reusing a file a lot, after I find it I will grab the full path using something like realpath:
$ realpath 000-default
/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default
(copy and paste path into next command:)
$ vi /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default

Caveats
This still requires copying and pasting. I believe there should be an easier way to get a file's full path into my history. What options do I have?
I believe that I have (accidentally) pressed some key combination before that expanded a relative path into a full path. I know in bash you can type:
cd /etc
ls bash_*(control+x *)

and get:
ls bash.bashrc bash_completion bash_completion.d

So is there a way I can expand a relative path into an absolute path, so that I can save operations on a file in my history with that file's full path?

A:

You could use programmable tab completion within bash for this:
function _vim_complete_file() {
    IFS=$'\n' read -d '' -a FILES <<< "$( compgen -A file "${COMP_WORDS[$COMP_CWORD]}" )"
    IFS=$'\n' read -d '' -a COMPREPLY <<< "$( realpath "${FILES[@]}" )"
}

complete -F _vim_complete_file vim

Now if you type vim 000TAB, it will replace 000 with /path/to/000-default.
Explanation
The way this works is that complete -F _vim_complete

​

A:

ko.utils.arrayMap doesn't map your viewmodel's properties as observables, and that's why you don't see them updated dynamically.
If you define your CategoryId as an observable, you'll see it update as expected:
var initialData = [
    {
        Name: "Television",
        CategoryId: ko.observable("1")
    },
    {
        Name: "Melon",
        CategoryId: ko.observable("2")
    }
];

Get page source after each button click in a loop with get_elements_by_xpath using Selenium

I would like to automatically download text files for ATS Blocks Download section on FINRA website. The problem is while I am able to click on the icon and open the file in the browser, I cannot get the page source after the click. driver.page_source returns the page source for the ATS Blocks Download section page (the one before the click).

from selenium import webdriver
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager
import time 

driver = webdriver.Chrome(ChromeDriverManager().install())
URL = 'https://otctransparency.finra.org/otctransparency/'
driver.get(URL)

# Agree to the general terms
driver.find_element_by_xpath('//*[@class="btn btn-warning"]').click()

#go to ATS Blocks Download section
driver.find_element_by_xpath('//*[@href="/otctransparency/AtsBlocksDownload"]').click()

#wait for the page to fully load
time.sleep(5)

#click on each download icon
for element in driver.find_elements_by_xpath('//*[@src="./assets/icon_download.png"]'):

Use the command to remove file_name_to_remove
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  'git rm -r --cached --ignore-unmatch file_name_to_remove' \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

After the filter branch is complete, verify that no unintended file was lost.
Now add a .gitignore rule 
echo "file_name_to_remove" >> .gitignore
git add .gitignore && commit -m "removing filename"

Now do a push
git push -f origin branch

You will need to do a forced push in case you have already pushed your branch becuase the commits were re-written. Otherwise, if the changes are local only, you can do a normal push as well. The added advantage is that if you have added this file in multiple commits, you can completely remove it from the history from across all commits.

A:

If you have not pushed this big file (and I presume that's the case due to the error), just do a git rebase -i <some commit before the one where the large one was added> and then delete the commit where you added the large file. The commits will get rewritten and you'll have a string of commits that don't have the offending one. You'll be able to push this.
When you do a rebase -i, you'll see something like this pop up in your editor. When I say "delete" a commit, you simply have to delete the line that that refers to it in the list (e.g. suppose faed141 is the commit where you added your large file, simply delete the line that refers to it in the list below). Then save and exit your editor. Git will rewrite the tree dropping that commit and you're good to go.
pick 53542eb Changes a
pick a30f028 Adds b
pick faed141 Adds c
pick 5446c0f Adds d

I found a post with a similar problem How to get stream info from opened file in ffmpeg? but no one answered correctly yet.
I've found people are told to check if opencv is using old fmmpeg instead of libav, which it isn't since it's a fresh build and my ubuntu doesn't have ffmpeg.

A:

Dimazavr's answer is not totally right. First, you need to change the output video filename extension from .mp4 to .avi. Then if you run the code, you will get the following error information:
OpenCV Error: Unsupported format or combination of formats (Gstreamer Opencv backend does not support this codec.) in CvVideoWriter_GStreamer::open, file /home/rwduzhao/store/opencv-2.4.13/modules/highgui/src/cap_gstreamer.cpp, line 1372

Aborted (core dumped)

That means either cv::VideoWriter in opencv2.4 doesn't support libx264 format or avi extension is not incompatible with libx264 format. I suggest not to use libx264 codec. You can try the following codec formats list supported by CV_FOURCC:
CV_FOURCC('P','I','M','1')    = MPEG-1 codec
CV_FOURCC('M','J','P','G')    = motion-jpeg codec
CV_FOURCC('M', 'P', '4', '2') = MPEG-4.2 codec
CV_FOURCC('D', 'I', 'V', '3') = MPEG-4.3 codec
CV_FOURCC('D', 'I', 'V', 'X') = MPEG-4 codec
CV_FOURCC('U', '2', '6', '3') = H263 codec
CV_FOURCC('I',

I need to create simple code that will upload a .csv file to an FTP server. The code is below.
import ftplib
import os
import sys
sourceFilePath = '/home/user/dir/'
filename = 'testing.csv'
destinationDirectory = 'anotherDirectory'
server = 'ftp://12.123.12.234'
username = 'aUser'
password = 'passwd1234'
myFTP = ftplib.FTP(server, username, password)
myFTP.cwd('/anotherDirectory/')
myFTP.storbinary('STOR '+filename, open(filename,'rb'))
myFTP.quit()

However, when I run the code, I get the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./UploadToFTP.py", line 20, in <module>
  File "./UploadToFTP.py", line 13, in uploadFileFTP
    myFTP = ftplib.FTP(server, username, password)

    self.connect(host)

    self.sock = socket.create_connection((self.host, self.port), 
self.timeout)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.6/socket.py", line 553, in create_connection
    for res in getaddrinfo(host, port, 0, SOCK_STREAM):
socket.gaierror: [Errno -3] Temporary failure in name resolution

Has anyone seen this before? It seems rather generic to me and doesn't tell me much. So far as other code I've seen performing this same task, I don't have any currently visible errors. Any help would be appreciated.

A:

The host argument of ftplib.FTP constructor is a hostname/IP address, not a URL.
So this is wrong:
server = 'ftp://12.123.12.234'

It should be:
server = '12.123.12.234'

If your URL contains a custom port, see Python ftplib - specify port

Can I reuse a Style using different DataTrigger Bindings?

I am working on a WPF 4.0 window with many status indicators using Labels.  In one example, the Labels turn GREEN and read "Available" if the bound property's enumeration Foo is AVAILABLE.  The labels turn RED and read "Not Available" if the bound property is NOTAVAILABLE.  I also have other labels that indicate status of different bound enum Bar, and they turn different colors and have different content based on this value.
I am able to successfully bind and turn one label's color and text based on the value of a bound property.  I use a rather lengthy ControlTemplate in a DataTrigger's Setter just to change the label's text.
Here's what I have so far:
<Window> ...
    xmlns:cst="clr-namespace:CstCommonTypes;assembly=CstCommonTypes"
    ...
</Window>

<Label x:Name="Avail_Out_LBL" HorizontalAlignment="Left" Margin="111,44,0,0" VerticalAlignment="Top" Width="124" Height="18" VerticalContentAlignment="Center" HorizontalContentAlignment="Center" SnapsToDevicePixels="False" Grid.Column="1" Padding="0">
  <Label.Style>
    <Style TargetType="{x:Type Label}">
        <Setter Property="Background" Value="#FFC08100"/>
        <Setter Property="Foreground" Value="White"/>
        <Setter Property="Template">
            <Setter.Value>
                <ControlTemplate>
                    <Grid Background="{TemplateBinding Background}">
                        <Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
                            <ColumnDefinition Width="24"/>
                            <ColumnDefinition Width="Auto"/>
                            <ColumnDefinition Width="24"/>
                        </Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
                        <TextBlock Text="Degraded"

I am very new to Ruby on Rails and have setup Devise for authentication. I have an existing model that I created prior to adding Devise. That model is called Article. I believe I have done everything I need to do in order to use the association=(associate) method that "assigns an associated object to this object. Behind the scenes, this means extracting the primary key from the associate object and setting this object’s foreign key to the same value" which is exactly what I need to do.
Here is Devise's User model:
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    # Include default devise modules. Others available are:
    # :confirmable, :lockable, :timeoutable and :omniauthable
    has_one :article
    devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,
     :recoverable, :rememberable, :trackable, :validatable
end

Here is my Article model:
class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user
  validates :name, presence: true, length: { minimum: 5 }
end

Here is my migration:
class AddUserRefToArticles < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def change
      add_reference :articles, :user, index: true
    end
end

Here is my create method from my articles_controller.rb:
def create
@article.user = current_user

@article = Article.new(post_params)

        if @article.save
            redirect_to @article
        else
            render 'new'
        end
end

And here is what happens when my controller runs:
NoMethodError in ArticlesController#create
undefined method `user=' for nil:NilClass

The highlighted code is @article.user = current_user. I was at least glad to know that I wrote that line of code similar to the popular answer in the Devise how to associate current user to post? question that I saw on here before posting this one.
I know I'm making a rookie mistake. What is it?

A:

A new User instance needs to be assigned to @article before you can access any of the instance's attributes/associations. Try the following:
@article = Article.new(post_params) # Assign first
@article.user = current_user

select column D by clicking the column header containing the "D", enter name "input1" into name field, press enter.
repeat for columns E to F, using "input2" and "input3" repectively.
DO NOT define additional names defining names "input1" [...] as in example above! 
use formula as given in example above

Attention:
Using named columns this way, you CANNOT access any other row as the one your formula is in!
At least I'm not aware of the possibility to express something like (row+1)...

A:

Suppose I have the following numbers set up in columns D to F in rows 2 to 4:
    D    E    F    G
2   10   15   20
3   1    2    3
4   20   30   40

Now suppose I want the value in column D to be known as input1, column E to be input2, and column F to input3:
In Insert > Name > Define...
input1 RefersTo =OFFSET(Sheet1!$D$2,0,0,COUNT(Sheet1!$D:$D),1)
input2 RefersTo =OFFSET(Sheet1!$E$2,0,0,COUNT(Sheet1!$E:$E),1)
input3 RefersTo =OFFSET(Sheet1!$F$2,0,0,COUNT(Sheet1!$F:$F),1)

Now if I write my formula in column G as follows I should get correct answers:
G2 =(10*input1+20*input2+30*input3) // 1000
G3 =(10*input1+20*input2+30*input3) // 140
G5 =(10*input1+20*input2+30*input3) // 2000

Does that help get you started?

A:

I would suggest creating a Table. Select your range A1:H4, then go to the Tables widget > New > Insert Table with Headers (on Mac). This will mark A2:H4 as body of the table, and A1:H4 as header.
From that, you get:

Whatever you put into the header column will define the name for this column automatically, e.g. Count, Radius, Density,

Calculating the inelastic quasiparticle lifetime of a screened quantum fluid

I've been studying "Lifetime of a quasiparticle in an electron liquid", by Qian and Vignale. Much of it makes sense, but there is a detail in the calculation of the exchange term that doesn't make sense to me. Eqn. 23 gives
$$\frac{2\pi me^2 }{pqk_s\sqrt{k_s^2+4k_F^2-q^2}}  $$
This follows from Eqn. 69 in the appendix of the article (omitting the Heaviside theta functions):
$$ \frac{2\pi me^2}{pq\sqrt{[p^2+k^2+k_s^2-{\bf k}\cdot {\bf q}]^2-[k^2-({\bf k}\cdot {\bf \hat{q}})^2][4p^2-q^2] }} $$
Equating the two, this tells me that
$$k_s\sqrt{k_s^2+4k_F^2-q^2}=\sqrt{[p^2+k^2+k_s^2-{\bf k}\cdot {\bf q}]^2-[k^2-({\bf k}\cdot {\bf \hat{q}})^2][4p^2-q^2] } $$
The authors obtain Eqn. 23 from Eqn. 69 by assuming that $p\sim k\sim k_F$ and ${\bf k}\cdot {\bf q}\sim -\frac{q^2}{2}$. The r.h.s. of the above then becomes 
\begin{align}
&\sqrt{[p^2+k^2+k_s^2-{\bf k}\cdot {\bf q}]^2-[k^2-({\bf k}\cdot {\bf \hat{q}})^2][4p^2-q^2] }\notag\\
\approx&  \sqrt{[2k_F^2+k_s^2+q^2/2]^2-1/4[4k_F^2-q^2]^2 }  \notag\\
&=\sqrt{4k_F^4+4k_F^2k_s^2+2k_F^2q^2+k_s^4+k

class Foo < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :node
end

Frequently, I want to find all of the foos or bars for a given subtree, looking down from a current node. Naively, I could do:
@foos = @node.self_and_descendants.collect(&:foos).compact  

I could even use an ActiveRecord .includes(:foos) to avoid N+1 queries. What I really want is just to ask for @node.all_foos so I implement something like this: 
class Node < ActiveRecord::Base
  def all_foos
    Foo.where(node_id: self_and_descendants.pluck(:id))
  end

  # More efficient?
  def all_foos_alternately
    Foo.where(node_id: self_and_descendants.includes(:foos).pluck(:id))
  end
end

But, let's say that I want to “collect” more than just foos and bars, let's say that I have half a dozen or a dozen of this models. Now I'm littering my Node class or some lib with a bunch of all_* methods. 
Should I be defining class methods on the foos and bars that accept a node as an argument and return all of the foos/bars for that subtree? But then the foos and bars need to understand/be aware of node.self_and_descendants. 
Or the Foo class method could accept a collection of nodes, not needing to be aware of the nested set methods, but then I lose the easy interface via node.all_foos or the like. 
What's the pattern or method I'm missing here? I've played with implementing a catch-all for node.all_* via method_missing but don't like the performance hit. What I'm trying to execute here is, at its core, a database lookup and, as such, it should be efficient and elegant. 

A:

Thank you to @adamsanderson for pointing me in the right direction with regards to joins and merge. Merge allows you to filter a joined association via another scope or relation. Brilliant!
def all_foos
  Foo.joins(:node).merge(self_and_descendants)
end

export class ThreeManagerService {
   const loader = new THREE.BinaryLoader();

the fact is that I consider this workaround a very ugly "fix". I would like to use the type system as much as possible.
EDIT: Get examples to play nice with Intellisense & Typescript
While waiting for a complete rewriting of the examples to be compatible with the ES6 modules and namespaces it could be possible to define a local module that exposes and augments the global, in /src/node_modules/three-extras/index.ts:
import * as THREE from 'three';

declare global {
   interface Window {
      THREE: typeof THREE;
   }
}

window.THREE = THREE;

require('three/examples/js/controls/OrbitControls');
require('three/examples/js/loaders/GLTFLoader');

I've finally reached two working solutions (=> workarounds to be precise). 
Using Webpack's imports-loader

[...] import-loader is a Webpack plugin allows you to inject a global variable into your module's scope. So the global (!) namespace of your execution context still remains completely clean, but during "compilation", Webpack will be able to figure out where to lookup the binding for a module that only comes with a global variable.

Via this three.js ticket 
import "imports?THREE=three!loaders/BinaryLoader";

Using this import we tell Webpack to use THREE as a global variable defined by the npm module 'three' and the BinaryLoader wont be binded to any variable.
Use three-full to provide the THREE namespace
The project three-full extends the namespace defined by the standard three.js library adding several "examples" like loaders and controls. Using it instead of the classical three npm package it will be possible to have full support to ES6 namespaces for the most common and useful classes that usually are part of the great majority of those projects based on three.js.

I mean to say, In the sheet 1, Value named "John" has 4 counts so it is printed in sequence number 1,2,3,4 and in sheet 2, the same Value "John" has again appeared 2 times, so in the sequence number column the count has continued from sheet 1 (5,6). As the value changes to "Mathew" in the sequence number column it has allotted the count (1) Sheet 1, In sheet 2 for the Particular value "Mathew" the count is incremented from sheet 1 and it is printed, as of same in the sheet 3. Now, this should apply for all the values.
Please help me regarding this, as the data is huge it is impossible to manipulate manually.
Please show me the way in macros. Thanks in advance.

A:

Put the following code and add a reference to the "Microsoft Scripting Runtime"  (Tools > Reference) so you can use a dictionary structure
Sub CountOccurence()
' Reference: Microsoft Scripting Runtime

Application.ScreenUpdating = False

Set oDict = New Dictionary
Dim Shts() As Variant
Dim wS As Worksheet
Dim r As Integer, rLast As Integer
Dim i As Integer

Shts = Array("Sheet1", "Sheet2", "Sheet3", "Sheet4")

For i = 0 To 3 Step 1

    Set wS = Sheets(Shts(i))

    rLast = wS.Cells(1, 1).CurrentRegion.Rows.Count

Counting the number of ways to form teams

Here's the Question,
12 employees are eligible for working on a company's project. The team must consist of 4 people. However, two employees had a fight and refuse to work together. How many ways can the team be formed?
So I am having a hard time checking/confirming if my thinking behind this is correct, even when looking at exclusion-inclusions principles. So I will explain what I think is right and hopefully someone can confirm the logic.
1) $^{12}C_4$ is the total number of ways of selecting a team of 4. 
   $^{10}C_2$ is the total number of ways to exclude the 2 people being together. $^{12}C_4 - ^{10}C_2 =450$ possible ways.
2) Excluding 1 of the two leaves $^{11}C_4$ possible choices.
   Excluding the other 1 instead is also $^{11}C_4$ possible choices. However, this over counts the 10 other people in both cases which is $^{10}C_4$ choices. Therefore $2 \times ^{11}C_4 - ^{10}C_4 = 450$ possible ways. 
I know the answer of 450 is right, but I am unsure if my reasoning behind these calculations is correct. Maybe there is another way to look at this problem that is easier to grasp?
Many Thanks
Ken

A:

Your first method is an elegant way to solve the problem.
Here is another approach.  Observe that either exactly one of the two feuding employees is placed on the team or neither one is.  
Exactly one of the two feuding employees is placed on the team:  We choose which of the two feuding employees is placed on the team and which three of the other ten employees is placed on the team with that person, which can be done in $$\binom{2}{1}\binom{10}{3}$$ ways.
Neither of the two feuding employees is placed on the team:  We must choose which four of the other ten employees is placed on the team, which can be done in $$\binom{10}{4}$$ ways.
Total:  Since these two cases are mutually exclusive, the number of ways the team of four employees can be chosen without placing the two feuding employees together is 
$$\binom{2}{1}\binom{10}{3} +

I apologise in advance if this question is considered too easy or whatever; this is the first time I'm writing anything in go. I have two structs (simplified for this question)
type A struct {
    Content string
}

type B struct {
    Element A `json:"0"`
    Children []B `json:"1"`
}

I want to encode a value of type B into JSON, but instead of returning an object it should return a json array
For example:
What I get: 
[
    {
        "0":{
            "Content":"AAA"
        },
        "1":[
            {
                "0":{
                    "Content":"BBB"
                },
                "1":[
                    {
                        "0":{
                            "Content":"CCC"
                        },
                        "1":[]
                    },
                    {
                        "0":{
                            "Content":"DDD"
                        },
                        "1":[]
                    }
                }
            ]
        ]
    }
]

What I need:
[
    {"Content": "AAA"}, 
    [
        [
            {"Content": "BBB"},
            [
                {"Content": "CCC"}, 
                []
            ]
        ], 
        [
            {"Content": "DDD"}, 
            []
        ]
    ]
]

I could do this by manually iterating through it, but I would hope that there's an integrated way to do it

A:

You may do so by implementing json.Marshaler interface in B.
For example: https://play.golang.org/p/fT1WlQ5Raz
package main

import (
    "encoding/json"
    "fmt"
)

type A struct {
    Content string
}

type B struct {
    Element  A
    Children []B
}

// MarshalJSON implements json.Marshaler
func (b B) MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error) {
    return json.Marshal([]interface{}{
        b.Element,
        b.Children,
    })
}

func main() {

    root := B{
        Element: A{Content: "AAA"},
        Children: []B{
            B

Should i be using Categories or Static Blocks to add new menu items in Nav Bar?

I have been directed to use categories (subcategories & url reqwrite) but I don't like that every link after 'HOME' is a sub of 'HOME' 
I also can't seem to be able to find any pages, static blocks or categories linked to the 'HOME' Button. Only a page, which doesn't affect the button text itself. 

A:

It is unclear what Home and New Page really is. Hence I assume they are two categories that exists in your Magento instance.
In default RWD Theme which is available in Magento 1.9, only active categories will be added to topmenu section. This means that you can see only categories (which are active) by default in topmenu section. CMS Pages and static blocks will not be available as a topmenu item unless you have added them to topmenu section manually.
From your vague question, I think you have basically two questions.
How can I add a category as a sub-item of another category ?
This is how Men menu and it's children look like in default RWD theme

See the category settings in admin corresponding Men Category

As you can see, Men Category comes under Default Category. All sibling menu items of Men Category similarly comes directly under Default Category. You can also see, all sub-menu items of Men menu item is actually sub-categories of Men Category.
This is what you need to do in this case. If you need to make a sub-menu item for Home, then you need to put New Page as a sub-category of Home category. 
How can I add a new topmenu Item ?
Magento provides two events to add your custom topmenu items in topmenu tree. They are :

page_block_html_topmenu_gethtml_before
page_block_html_topmenu_gethtml_after

If you do a close inspection, Mage_Catalog module is observing to the event page_block_html_topmenu_gethtml_before and adding categories as topmenu items via observer. You can use this classic example to create your own custom menu tree and then add it to the topmenu tree. All you need to do is observe to this either of these events and add your menu item.
You can add a CMS Page as a topmenu item or any other custom

How long will this appliance run from a battery?

How long can I run a water pump which requires 12V and 50W from a 12V, 40Ah, 400A car battery?
Can you explain how this was calculated?

A:

Short answer: 9 hours, 36 minutes
Long answer: 
Assuming the system is 100% efficient, (i.e. no resistive losses in cables, or internal resistance from battery)
Power (Watts) = I(Amps) * V(Voltage)

Therefore, 

Amps = Power/Voltage

50/12 = 4.16666A

Assuming that the battery is fully charged, then it will have the full 40AH capacity. 
This battery is not linked to a boost converter or anything like that, so it would be 4.16 amps at 12 volts, so we don't need to do any more calculating here. If the power output was not at 12v, then we would reverse the power equation to do 12*40 = 480WH. This means the battery can provide 480 Watts for 1 hour.
40AH (Amp Hours)/4.16Amps = 9.6 hours, or 9 hours and 36 minutes.
or
480WH (Watt Hours)/50 (Watts) = 9.6 hours, or 9 hours and 36 minutes.

Longer answer:
Sadly, in the real world, nothing is as easy as this. Batteries are not perfect. They have some internal resistance, which we have to factor in.
We can also calculate the resistive losses from the internal resistance of the battery from the 400A rating
R = V/I
R = 12/400
R = 0.03 ohms

P = I^2 * R
P = 4.16^2 * 0.03 = 0.52083W lost 

In 1 hour = 0.52083Wh lost, as you multiply by one.
Therefore, in 9.6 hours, it means 5 watts is lost.
480Wh - 0.52083Wh = 479.49716 Wh

479.49716/50 = 9.589583 hours.

This is 9 hours, 35 minutes and 22.5 seconds

A:

Practically speaking, about 4 - 5 hours. Your battery energy capacity is 12 volts x 40

Okay, I know. I know... this one is probably an easy one. But, I'm very new to OOP and want to learn how to recycle my code more efficiently.

   // Get given's team record thus far

Qt QLCDNumber issue

I am making a timer/stopwatch with Qt Creator. But, my reset function (reset button clicked) is not working as I want it to. I want it to stop the timer and set the display (QLCDNumber) to 0. Instead, the timer is stopped but the display numbers stay the same as if the pause button was clicked. Except that when the timer is started (start button clicked) again, it restarts from the original time (as I want it to do). Here is the code.
I only included the parts that are part of the problem.
void MainWindow::delay()
{
    QTime dieTime = QTime::currentTime().addSecs(1);
    while (QTime::currentTime() < dieTime && !spause && !sreset)

Q:

Can I set a single thread's priority above 15 for a normal priority process?

I have a data acquisition application running on Windows 7, using VC2010 in C++.  One thread is a heartbeat which sends out a change every .2 seconds to keep-alive some hardware which has a timeout of about .9 seconds.  Typically the heartbeat call takes 10-20ms and the thread spends the rest of the time sleeping.
Occasionally however there will be a delay of 1-2 seconds and the hardware will shut down momentarily.  The heartbeat thread is running at THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL which is 15 for a normal priority process.   My other threads are running at normal priority, although I use a DLL to control some other hardware and have noticed with Process Explorer that it starts several threads running at level 15.
I can't track down the source of the slow down but other theads in my application are seeing the same kind of delays when this happens.  I have made several optimizations to the heartbeat code even though it is quite simple, but the occasional failures are still happening.  Now I wonder if I can increase the priority of this thread beyond 15 without specifying REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS for the entire process.  If not, are there any downsides I should be aware of to using REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS?  (Other than this heartbeat thread, the rest of the application doesn't have real-time timing needs.)
(Or does anyone have any ideas about how to track down these slowdowns...not sure if the source could be in my app or somewhere else on the system).
Update: So I hadn't actually tried passing 31 into my AfxBeginThread call and turns out it ignores that value and sets the thread to normal priority instead of the 15 that I get with THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL.
Update: Turns out running the Disk Defragmenter is a good way to cause lots of thread delays.  Even running the process at REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS and the heartbeat thread at THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL (level 31) doesn't seem to help.  Next thing to try is calling AvSetMmThreadCharacteristics("Pro Audio")
Update: Scheduling heartbeat thread as "Pro Audio" does work to increase the thread's priority beyond 15 (Base=1, Dynamic=

Q:

If $\{\nabla u_j\}$ is Cauchy in $L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and $\int_{B(0,1)} u_j dx = 0$, does $\{u_j\}$ converge in $L^p_{\text{loc}}(\mathbb{R}^n)$?

Let $1 < p < \infty$. Let $\{u_j\}_{j=1}^\infty$ be a sequence of functions in $W^{1,p}_{\text{loc}}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ such that

$\nabla u_j \in L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for all $j$,
$\int_{B(0,1)} u_j dx = 0$ for all $j$,
$\{ \nabla u_j \}_{j= 1}^\infty$ is a Cauchy sequence in $L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$.

I would like to know whether $\{u_j\}_{j=1}^\infty$ is a Cauchy sequence in $L^p_{\text{loc}}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ (and hence convergent in $L^p_{\text{loc}}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ since this space is a Frechet space).  That is, I would like to know whether it can be shown that, for any ball $B(0,r)$:
$$\|u_j - u_k \|_{L^p(B(0,r))}^p \to 0 $$
as $j$ and $k$ become large.

This result is claimed to be true in this paper on arXiv (see Proposition 2.1). The details of the proof are not supplied.
If 2. above is replaced by the condition that $\int_{B(0,r)} u_j dx = 0$ for all $r$ and all $j$, then I can get the result by applying Poincare's inequality for a ball (see Theorem 2 in section 5.8 from Evan's PDE book), and then and using 3. However, with only the weaker condition I'm not sure how to proceed.
Hints or solutions are greatly appreciated!

A:

The vanishing integral over the small ball is enough to get a Poincaré-type estimate. Let $B = B(0,1)$ and $\Omega = B(0,r)$.
We define $$\|u\|_\star := \big|\int_B

The Lagrangian for the motion of a particle with mass $m$ and charge $q$ in a constant magnetic field $B$ is given by $$\mathcal{L}(x,v)=\frac{m}{2}\left|v\right|^2-\frac{q}{2c}\left(v\cdot[x\times B]\right).$$
Show that rotations around the $B$-axis leave the Lagrangian invariant, where each rotation is given by $O_{\eta}:=\exp(\eta\,[B\,\times \,.]),\,\eta\in\mathbb{R}$.

I can see that $\left|O_{\eta}(v)\right|^2=\left|v\right|^2$, since rotations are supposed to leave the "length" unchanged but that's about as far as I've gotten with this. I'm guessing that one needs to apply some certain identities here regarding the cross product and the $\exp$ function, which I haven't been able to find on Wikipedia or other websites so far.

A:

you have to show that $\mathcal{L}'=\mathcal{L}$
with:
$$\mathcal{L}=\frac{m}{2}\vec{v}^T\,\vec{v}-\frac{q}{2c}\vec{v}^T\,\vec{\omega}$$
where $\vec{\omega}=\vec{x}\times\vec{B}$
$$\mathcal{L}'=\frac{m}{2}\vec{v}'^T\,\vec{v}'-\frac{q}{2c}\vec{v}'^T\,\vec{\omega}'$$
with:

$\vec{v}'=O_{\eta}\,\vec{v}$
$\vec{\omega}'=O_{\eta}\vec{\omega}$
$O_{\eta}=\exp(\eta\,[\hat{\vec{B}}\,\times ])$

and
$O_{\eta}^T=\exp(-\eta\,[\hat{\vec{B}}\,\times  ])\quad $ thus $O_{\eta}^T\,O_{\eta}=I_3$
you obtain :
$$\vec{v}'^T\,\vec{v}'=\left(O_{\eta}\,\vec{v}\right)^T\,O_{\eta}\,\vec{v}=\vec{v}^T\,\vec{v}$$
$$\vec{v}'^T\,\vec{\omega}'=\left(O_{\eta}\,\vec{v}\right)^T\,O

I am running a SQL Query and returning a DataSet - I want to iterate the info in the DataSet and assign the values to local variables.  I have confirmed that my DataSet returns rows but my variables are not getting assigned for some reason.  Can someone look at my syntax and assist with why this is occurring?
protected void GetSomeData()
{
  string employeeid = this.txtemployeeid.Text;
  DataSet empinfo = new DataSet();
  empinfo = RunSqlQuery(employeeid);
  this.txtemployeefirstname = empinfo.Tables[0].Rows[0]["employeefirstname"].ToString());
  this.txtemployeelastname = empinfo.Tables[0].Rows[1]["employeelastname"].ToString());
  this.txtemployeeaddress = empinfo.Tables[0].Rows[2]["employeeaddress"].ToString());
  this.txt.employeephone = empinfo.Tables[0].Rows[3]["employeephone"].ToString());
}
public DataSet RunSqlQuery(string employeeid)
{
  string sqlQuery = "Select employeefirstname, employeelastname, employeeaddress, employeephone from abcd where employeeid = "+employeeid+" and employeeid is not null";
  try
  {             
      connectionString = System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[connectionString].ToString();   
      sqlDatabaseConnection = new SqlConnection(connectionString);
      sqlCommand = new SqlCommand(sqlQuery, sqlDatabaseConnection);
      sqlDatabaseConnection.Open();
      sqlCommand.CommandTimeout = 0;        
      dataSet = new DataSet();
      sqlDataAdapter = new SqlDataAdapter(sqlCommand);            
      sqlDataAdapter.Fill(dataSet, "Data");
      return dataSet;
  }
  catch (Exception exception)
  {
      throw exception;
  }
  finally
  {
      sqlDatabaseConnection.Close();
      sqlCommand.Dispose();
      sqlDataAdapter.Dispose();
  }

}
EDIT
By variables not getting assigned, I mean when I step through my code, it seems that the value returned from the database is not being populated into the empinfo.Tables[0].

How to include a C library in Forth

As default, Forth has only a little amount of working libraries so that everything has to be programmed from scratch. The reason is, that the stackbased Forth virtual machine identifies itself as a slim system.
According to the Gforth manual, it's possible to use existing C libraries and get access to precompiled graphics libraries and game-engines written in C. Before it's possible to include the C library in Forth, it's a good idea to test the library within a normal C project.
I've created a library in C from scratch. It provides an add function and can be called from the main program. The files are compiled and linked and it works fine.
### add.c ###
int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
### add.h ###
int add(int, int);

### main.c ###
#include <stdio.h>
#include "add.h"
void main() {
  printf("5 + 7 = %d\n", add(5,7));
}

### compile ###
gcc -c -fPIC add.c
gcc -c main.c
gcc main.o add.o
./a.out
5 + 7 = 12

The plan is to use this precompiled c-library from Forth. The Gforth compiler provides a special keyword for that purpose which connects a Forth program with a C library. Unfortunately, I get an error message saying that the library wasn't found. Even after copying it manually to the Gforth folder, the error message doesn't disappear.
### Forth source code ###
\c #include "add.h"
c-function add add n n -- n

I used this code to create a grid layout of buttons.
I need a particular Button of the grid to be colored different from the others only if a condition is fulfilled.
The condition is checked in the .py file 
sql_conn.execute("SELECT ...")
rows = sql_conn.fetchall()
for row in rows:
    for col in row:
        self.data_items.append(col)
    if row[2] == row[4]:

As you can see I have a query that fetches all the elements for the grid layout.
The query get some elements from the database and in particular QTA (total quantity) and OK (how many products have been checked).
In the grid layout there will be the name of the products followed by their total and checked quantities.
If the two quantities of the product are the same i want the QTA button to be colored in green.
I tried lot of things but I was able to color only all the buttons of the grid layout.
If I try something like this I will abviously color all the buttons
rows = sql_conn.fetchall()
for row in rows:
    for col in row:
        self.data_items.append(col)
    if row[2] == row[4]:
        Button.background_color = [0,255,0,0.3]

Can someone help me?

A:

RecycleView receives as a data list of dictionaries, in those dictionaries the properties of the elements are indicated, so we must create those properties and then copy it, in your code I see that those dictionaries are creating them in the .kv, now you must do it in the .py as I show below:
*.py
rows = sql_conn.fetchall()
values = []
for row in rows:
    change_color = row[2] == row[4]
    for i, col in enumerate(row):
        text = str(col)
        color =  [0, 255, 0, 0.3] if i == 4 and change_color else [1, 1, 1, 1]
        d = dict(text=text, background_color=color)
        values.append(d)

self.data_items = values

Q:

RMStore offline receipt verification

One question about offline receipt verification using RMStore (https://github.com/robotmedia/RMStore)
On App start I check if the app has a valid in app purchase (PRO Version)
(my App is iOS7 only)
I do that like that:
RMStoreAppReceiptVerificator *verificator = [[RMStoreAppReceiptVerificator alloc] init];
BOOL isValidReceipt = [verificator verifyAppReceipt];
if (isValidReceipt)
{
    BOOL isProVersion = [[RMAppReceipt bundleReceipt] containsInAppPurchaseOfProductIdentifier:xxx];
    ...
}

I still have version 1.0 in the App Store... But now i'd like to make an update soon... This will still work after an app store update, right? The App will still have the receipt in there and verification should still pass, right?
I ask because testing in-app purchases is not really easy (especially updating and stuff) and if something fails users would be pissed....

A:

The code should work as before. However, you're not verifying the receipt correctly. Quoting the Receipt Validation Programming Guide:

If validation fails in iOS, use the SKReceiptRefreshRequest class to refresh the receipt.

Using RMStore, that would look like this:
const BOOL verified = [self verifyReceiptWithCustomLogic];
if (verified)
{
    // Verification succeeded
} 
else 
{ // Apple recommends to refresh the receipt if validation fails on iOS
    [[RMStore defaultStore] refreshReceiptOnSuccess:^{
        const BOOL verified = [self verifyReceiptWithCustomLogic];
        if (verified)
        {
            // Verification succeeded
        }
        else
        {
            // Verification failed
        }
    } failure:^(NSError *error) {
            // Verification failed
    }];
}

Where your verification logic appears to be:
- (BOOL)verifyReceiptWithCustomLogic
{
    RMStoreAppReceiptVerificator *verificator = [RMStoreAppReceiptVerificator new];
    if ([verificator verifyAppReceipt])
    {
        return [[RMAppRe

Vejo muito isso em métodos
class Exemplo
{
    public function exemplo1(array $parameters = array())
    {
    }

    public function exemplo2(array $parameters)
    {
    }

    public function exemplo3($parameters = array())
    {
    }
}

Isso significa que $parameters é um array, mas qual a diferença entre essas implementações?

A:

Dois conceitos importantes que você precisa entender são o de type hinting e valor padrão do parâmetro.
O type hinting obriga que argumento passado tenha um tipo específico (no caso um array). 
A partir do PHP 7 podemos fazer type hinting dos tipos primitivos (int, string, float). 
Antes do PHP 7 o type hinting é limitado a Objetos, Interfaces, arrays e closures.
Agora o valor padrão do parâmetro, é o valor que o parâmetro irá assumir caso não seja passado nada para aquele parâmetro. Entenda como um parâmetro opcional.
Tomando seus exemplos, você então teria:
// Um método que obriga que o argumento seja um array 
// mas aceita uma chamada sem parâmetros:
public function exemplo1(array $parameters = array()){ }

$obj->exemplo1();

// Obriga que o argumento seja um array, e que o parâmetro seja passado: 
public function exemplo2(array $parameters){ }

$obj->exemplo2(array('id' => 1));

// Se nada for passado como argumento, assumirá o valor de um array vazio, 
// mas te permite passar outros tipos como argumento
public function exemplo3($parameters = array()){ }

$obj->exemplo3("Eu nao sou um array, mas tudo bem!");

Ao passar um valor padrão que não satisfaça o type hinting, será retornado um erro:
// Type hinting de array e valor padrão string
public function test(array $teste

Can I mix JSF components with primeng?

A:

TL;DR: Yes it is possible, but there are better alternatives
Important concepts:

AngularJS is a synonym for angular version 1
Angular2 is synonym for angular version 2 (not backwards compatible with v1)
primeng is a components library that depends on angular2
primefaces is a components library that depends on JSF
JSF and angular2 are MVC frameworks, where each one has injection mechanisms based on annotations (@annotation) although the terminology is similar the underneath of both mechanisms is very different
angular2 + primeng is used with typescript (recommended) or javascript, on the other hand, JSF + primefaces is used with java
primeng is client-side, primefaces is server-side
the company developing primeng is the same company developing primefaces, and recently we as users have seen a very good synergy, where if there is an improvement in one component is then ported to the other library.
Right now (2016) primefaces has more components than primeng and feels more polished

Implications of using primeng + JSF (primefaces):

Each framework has different lifecycles with different concepts and implications (given that one is client-side and the other is server-side), if you start to use both frameworks you have to understand them at great detail.
If you start mixing components of both frameworks this is going to be very hard to maintain

Other approaches:

primeng + JAX-RS: Given that you are using wildfly this will be easy to implement, all services provide the info to the client components. It tends to be the 'modern' approach.
JSF + primefaces: this is the simplest solution, only server side, only one framework to learn.
use JSF only as a template engine (facelets) and on top of it use angular2 + primeng: yes, this could work but needs more investigation to make it properly, you need to really understand JSF and angular2 lifecycles, is not impossible but requires time.

As for you other question about npm:  Yes, you can use angular2 without npm, but you will need to write more boilerplate code than necessary, you can use this plunker

What is the most efficient way to construct XML from here?
I thought I could just match with struct and use them or parse them with existing XML template and replace the template variables?
if I had for example {username: '11', password: 'pass'} as request, How can I construct below XML out of 

A:

You can use the same struct for both XML and JSON, for example:
type Person struct {
    Id        int    `xml:"id,attr"`
    FirstName string `xml:"name>first" json:"first"`
    LastName  string `xml:"name>last" json:"last"`
}

func main() {
    j := `{"id": 10, "first": "firstname", "last":"lastname"}`
    var p Person
    fmt.Println(json.Unmarshal([]byte(j), &p), p)
    out, _ := xml.MarshalIndent(p, "\t", "\t")
    fmt.Println(string(out))

}

playground
Check the xml examples @ http://golang.org/pkg/encoding/xml/#example_Encoder
//edit
Well, since you already have a template you could use html/template, for example:
const xmlTmpl = `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE api SYSTEM "api.dtd">
<api version="6.0">
    <request>
<reqClient returnToken="N">
    <user>{{.AdminUsername}} </user>
    <password>{{.AdminPassword}}</password>
</reqClient><reqValidate returnBalance="Y">
    <userName>{{.Username}}</userName>
    <password>{{.Password}}</password>
    <channel>M</channel>
</reqValidate></request>
</api>
`

var tmpl = template.Must(template.New("foo").Parse(xmlTmpl))

type Entity struct {
    AdminUsername      string `json:"-"`
    AdminPassword      string `json:"-"`
    Username, Password string
}

func main() {
    e := Entity{Username: "User", Password: "Loser"}
    //json.NewDecoder(r.Request.Body).Decode(&e)
    

    v = glCreateShader(GL_VERTEX_SHADER);
    fstream vf(vpath);
    if (vf.good()) {
        ss << vf.rdbuf();
        const GLchar* g = ss.str().c_str();
        glShaderSource(v, 1, &g, nullptr);
        glCompileShader(v);
        glGetShaderInfoLog(v, 512, nullptr, log);
        cout << "Vertex Shader: " << log << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Bad path " << vpath.c_str() << endl;
        return static_cast<GLuint>(-1);
    }

    ss.str("");
    f = glCreateShader(GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER);
    fstream ff(fpath);
    if (ff.good()) {
        ss << ff.rdbuf();
        const GLchar* g = ss.str().c_str();
        glShaderSource(f, 1, &g, nullptr);
        glCompileShader(f);
        glGetShaderInfoLog(f, 512, nullptr, log);
        cout << "Fragment Shader: " << log << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Bad path " << fpath.c_str() << endl;
        return static_cast<GLuint>(-1);
    }

    GLuint prog;
    prog = glCreateProgram();
    glAttachShader(prog, v);
    glAttachShader(prog, f);
    glLinkProgram(prog);
    glGetProgramInfoLog(prog, 512, nullptr, log);
    cout << "Program: " << log;
    glDeleteShader(v);
    glDeleteShader(f);
    return prog;
}

It just says it's corrupted... And I have no idea where it had gone wrong. 
Here's what I got when I run the program: 

Vertex Shader:
  Fragment Shader:
  Program: ERROR: Compiled vertexshader was corrupt.

A:

Problem solved.
It's the problem of the loadProgram function, that vertex shader's ss.str().c_str() return a single '\0' character.

spectral radius monotonicity

I encountered an inequality when reading a paper. Can someone help to show how to prove it?
Let be the spectral radius of matrix $A$ or $\rho(A)=\max\{|\lambda|, \lambda \text{ are eigenvalues of matrix }A\}$. For matrices $S$ and $T$ with positive spectral radii, and two arbitrary real positive numbers $a$ and $b$, such that $\rho(S) < a < b$ Is the following inequality true?
$$b\rho((bI-S)^{-1}T) \leq a\rho((aI-S)^{-1}T)$$
If the above is not true in general, will it be true if $S$ and $T$ are non-negative matrices?

A:

Not true in general, as noted by @SergeiIvanov, but true for (element-wise) nonnegative matrices.
Note that if $\rho(S) < b$, then $b(bI-S)^{-1}=(I-\frac{S}{b})^{-1}=\sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{S^i}{b^i}$. In particular, thanks to this expansion, if $\rho(S)< a < b$, then $b(bI-S)^{-1}< a(aI-S)^{-1}$ in the componentwise ordering, and thus also $b(bI-S)^{-1}T \leq a(aI-S)^{-1}T$ for any nonnegative $T$. Now, it is a part of the Perron-Frobenius theorem that for any $A,B$ with $0 \leq A \leq B$ then $\rho(A) \leq  \rho(B)$, and that's all we need here.

A:

Update. This answer answers completely different question, see comments. Namely "positive" is substituted by "positive definite", norm is used instead of spectral radius, and quantifiers are different.
Not true in general: take $S=T=-I$. Then the inequality boils down to $\frac{b}{b+1}<\frac{a}{a+1}$ which is always false for $b>a>1$.
For positive symmetric matrices, yes. Fix $a$ and let $b\to+\infty$. The l.h.s equals to $\rho((I-\frac1bS)^{-

--> At a break point here I see result[0] == 6.5 and result[1] == 1.5
for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
{
    cout << result[i] << ",";
}

Fixed: Here's what I ended up with.
vector<double> haar1d(vector<double> vec, double seriesAverage)
{
vector<double> transVec(vec.size(), 0);
vector<double>::size_type length = vec.size();

if(vec[0] == seriesAverage)
{
    return vec;
}

int diffFromAvgs = length / 2;

for(int i = 0; i < length; i += 2)
{
    double pairAverage = (vec[i] + vec[i + 1]) / 2;
    transVec[i] = pairAverage;
    transVec[diffFromAvgs+i] = vec[i] - pairAverage;
}

return haar1d(transVec, seriesAverage);
}

in main:
vector<double> result = haar1d(series, avg);

for(vector<double>::iterator it = result.begin(); it != result.end(); ++it)
{
    cout << *it << ",";
}

A:

No, operator<< does not modify its arguments. It prints them as is. However, I bet your function looks something like this:
double* haar1d(/* ... */)
{
  double arr[N];
  // Fill this array
  return arr;
}

The point being that the array arr is local to the function. It will be destroyed when the function ends. However, you're returning a pointer to its first element. That pointer will be invalid outside the function, because the array it points to has been destroyed. To use this pointer now will invoke undefined behaviour, so you shouldn't be surprised if values start changing seemingly randomly.
I recommend using either std::array<double, N> or std::vector<double>, depending on whether your array size is a compile time constant or not. Returning either of these will copy its contents to the calling function.
If I'm guessing correctly, you might be using the argument that you gave as 2 as the size

Can INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT queries be put in the same file

var subTables = $("table").find("table");
var headerColumns = $("table:first").find("tr:first").find("th:not(:first)");
var widths = new Array();

for (i = 0; i < 9; i++){
     widths.push($(headerColumns.get(i)).width());
}

$.each(subTables.find("tr"), function(){
    var row = this;
    var rowCells = $(row).find("td");

    for (x = 0; x < 9; x++){
         var td = rowCells.get(x);

        if ($(td).width() > widths[x]){
               widths[x] =  $(td).width();
        }
    }
});

$.each(headerColumns, function(index){
    $(this).width(widths[index] + "px");
});

$.each(subTables.find("tr"), function(){
    var row = this;
    var rowCells = $(row).find("td");

    $.each(rowCells, function(index){
        $(this).width(widths[index] + "px");
    });
});

Make sure to add colspans to the outer table's cells.

Getting Promise data in the response in Angularjs

I have one service like below

Below controller i am using for fetching the data
controller.js
angular.module("adminsuite").controller("surveyController",['getAllSurveyService', '$scope', function(getAllSurveyService, $scope){
    $scope.header = "Header";
    $scope.allSurveys = getAllSurveyService.surveyList();
    console.log($scope.allSurveys);

        long start = System.currentTimeMillis();

        for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
            for (String aBoolean : booleans) {
                Boolean someBoolean = Boolean.valueOf(aBoolean);
            }
        }

        long end = System.currentTimeMillis();

        for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
            for (String aBoolean : booleans) {
                Boolean someBoolean = ModifiedBoolean.valueOf(aBoolean);
            }
        }

        long end = System.currentTimeMillis();

        System.out.println("ModifiedBoolean Runtime is: " + (end-start));
    }

class ModifiedBoolean {
    public static Boolean valueOf(String s) {
        return toBoolean(s) ? Boolean.TRUE : Boolean.FALSE;
    }

    private static boolean toBoolean(String name) {
        return "true".equalsIgnoreCase(name);

}

Here is the result:

JDK Boolean Runtime is: 37
ModifiedBoolean Runtime is: 34

So not much of a gain, especially when distributed over 1m runs. Really not all that surprising.
What I would like to understand is how these differ at the bytecode level. I am interested in delving into this area but don't have any experience. Is this more work than is worth while? Would it provide a useful learning experience? Is this something people do on a regular basis?

A:

There would be no performance gain for a couple of reasons:

It's just not that expensive of an operation to check whether or not name == null.
The thing that takes time is loading the value of name...which has to be loaded in either case.
name==null is faster then calling String.equalsIgnoreCase since it's a simple equality test rather

Q:

Answerers should not be able to vote for any other answer, of the same question

I decided to make my point today, but have had this thought for quite some time. 
Anyone answering a question should not be able to cast a +1 or -1 vote for any of the other answers of that same question.
In case the answer is posted after the vote happened, that vote should be nullified.
(In case the answer is deleted, same restriction).
Besides, it's related but not the main reason, the following is doable...

A makes an answer and gets a +1
B makes an answer after, and is at 0, their answer appears at the bottom
B downvote A for a few minutes to be at the same level
B, then, retracts their downvote, after their answer has been upvoted (same level again)

Not really fair...

A:

Votes are quality control for all the people reading the answers. We should have as much signalling as possible to all the people that are looking for an answer to their problem and don't know which to choose. We should waste their time as little as possible with trying flawed answers and direct them to the good ones.
And if I'm a subject matter expert and can answer the question, why shouldn't I also contribute to that quality control? My view is likely better than most when it comes to evaluating answers. Or why should I be put off from answering until everyone else has answered so I can still vote. We want to see good answers as soon as possible.
I write an answer, so does someone else shortly after and I think the other answer is wrong or provides bad advice. All I can do now is comment.
Equally if I see an answer and it's better than mine, maybe it covers some point I missed, why can't I upvote it? We even have a sportsmanship badge to encourage doing just that.

A:

That's a terrible idea. 
As a subject matter expert if I post an answer and then I see another answer, which I know is wrong or provides worse recommendation I must downvote it. If I can answer the question I should be able to also vote on other answers. After all, if I was able to answer it I think I know something about the topic to decide if the other answer is good or bad. 
Same thing

How to add error code numbers to the output text file?

I have a batch script which loops through all windows errors and puts them in a text file called helplog2.txt. However, they are not separated by blank lines and the error messages do not have the error numbers before them.
Is there any way to fix that?
Here is my batch script:
@echo off
If Exist HelpLog2.txt Del HelpLog2.txt
(for /l %%i in (0,1,99999) do net helpmsg %%i 1>NUL 2>&1 && echo %%i & net helpmsg %%i | findstr /i "[a-z]" >> HelpLog2.txt)
Start "" HelpLog2.txt
pause

A:

Use this batch code:
@echo off
del HelpLog2.txt 2>nul
for /L %%I in (0,1,9) do for /F delims^=^ eol^= %%J in ('%SystemRoot%\System32\net.exe helpmsg %%I 2^>^&1') do >>HelpLog2.txt echo     %%I: %%J

MVC null route ID takes me to spa(angular) rather than returning a bad request

I've been searching for this question for a while but have yet to find an answer.  In a nutshell, I have a .net core web application using the angular spa template.  I have multiple controllers that act as APIs and in general everything works fine.  However in the following situation, I'm curious if there is another way to accomplish a null id being sent WITHOUT overloading the action.
Here is what I have and works as expected:
[HttpGet("[action]")]
public IActionResult SayHello()
{
    return BadRequest(new
    {
        error = "Name registered as null.",
        message = "No value(null) was provided to the api resource 'SayHello' which resulted in no action taken."
    });
}

[HttpGet("[action]/{name}")]
public IActionResult SayHello(string name)
{
    return Ok($"Hello {name}");
}

What I want to know is this, can I accomplish this WITHOUT overloading?  For example, simply do this:
[HttpGet("[action]/{name}")]
public IActionResult SayHello(string name)
{
    if (name == null)
    {
        return BadRequest(new
        {
            error = "Name registered as null.",
            message = "No value(null) was provided to the api resource 'SayHello' which resulted in no action taken."
        });
    }
    return Ok($"Hello {name}");
}

Currently when I attempt this, the null id route will be treated as if it doesn't exist and the route will be passed to angular to deal with.  Is overloading the preferred and only way to accomplish this?  Or is there another way?

A:

Found the answer and it's rather simple.  Just need to add another attribute to the action method.
[HttpGet("[action]")]
[HttpGet("[action]/{name}")]
public IActionResult SayHello(string name)
{
    if (name == null)
    {
        return BadRequest(new
        {
            error = "Name registered as null.",
            message = "No value(null) was provided to the api resource

Scope
This code reads as though it was written by someone whose preferred language is C (pre-99). Variables should be declared when they're needed, not at the start of the method. The only case in which it's usually necessary to declare a variable without also initialising it is immediately before an if or case when each branch will initialise it. So, for example, in Main the variables adj, costLib, costStr don't need to be outside the loop. (In fact, only one of costLib and x needs to exist at all, because they're just aliases; similarly costStr and y). The variable Vertices in Graph is never read: your IDE is probably giving you a warning about that.

Comments
I don't see a single comment outside the parser. If it's throwaway code, that's fair enough, but it's rather counterproductive to ask for help improving your code and not explain anything about it. What approach are you taking? I can see that there's a DFS, but why? What does the return value of the DFS contain? Why is LibraryCounter initialised to 1?
The lack of comments is very evident in the fact that VisualMelon offered a hint in a comment on this question for something which I think is essentially the very heart of what the code is already doing: but that wasn't obvious from a quick look at the code.
If you write out the basics of your approach and the reasoning behind it, I think you'll find that there's a simpler way of doing it.

Names
Some of the names are so unhelpful that there are comments when they're assigned. Rather than

            Int64 n = Convert.ToInt32(tokens_n[0]); //Number of cities

why not this?
            var numCities = Convert.ToInt32(tokens_n[0]);

Most of the names follow C# capitalisation convention, but not all. Vertices and LibraryCounter are both local variables and should start with a lower-case letter. 

High-level data structures

        bool[] visited = new bool[v];

I assume that you're using C# with .Net, whether .Net Standard or .Net Framework. They both have high-level data structures which can make code easier to read and, in many cases, faster. If you flip this round as ISet<long> unvisited then the bulk of DFS can

Q:

I want a NumericUpDown to bind to a value and also contain a numeric string. How do I do that?

My NumericUpDown is bound to a double variable.  When displayed, I want it to show as "20/" plus whatever the decimal value is. I want the up/down arrows to be able to change the double that the control is bound to.
I tried this:
<xctk:DecimalUpDown Text="{Binding Path=DoubleValue}" FormatString=20/{}{0}/>

as well as several other similar things, but I keep getting Format Exceptions.  What's the proper format for FormatString?
I also tried using a converter with the following code:
public class DvaConverter : IValueConverter
{
    public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)
    {
        double dva = System.Convert.ToDouble(value);
        switch (System.Convert.ToInt16(parameter))
        {
            case 20:
                return string.Format("20/{0}", dva);
                break;
            case 6:
                return string.Format("6/{0}", dva);
                break;
            case 1:
                return string.Format("{0}", dva);
                break;
        }
        return string.Empty;
    }

    public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)
    {
        string dva = value as string;
        if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(dva))
        {
            dva = dva.Replace("20/", "").Replace("6/", "");
            return System.Convert.ToDouble(dva);
        }
        return 0;
    }
}

And this for the XAML:
xctk:DecimalUpDown Text="{Binding Path=UncorrectedDvaSnellen, UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged, Converter={StaticResource DvaConverter}, ConverterParameter=20}"/>

Still got a FormatException.

A:

After a ton of trial and error, the correct answer is apparently.
<xctk:DecimalUpDown Value="{Binding Path=DoubleValue}" FormatString="2\0/0"/>

The problem is following:
Currently I have a Service record type in cloud dashboard in development mode:

But the first version of this was WITHOUT createdAt field.
I did deploy first version to production mode and it was fine. Then I changed Service by adding createdAt field. And I did deploy it to production. So in production I have a fields like this:

there is no createdAt date.
And while I develop the app and try to fetch all Service records... everything is fine. They are fetched and working in the app. So I deploy changes to production mode, submit app to app store. Apple did review it... and... it is not working. WHY?
They do not have default createdAt value... and when I fetch all of them... nothing is fetched (because nothing appear in the app).
But...
when I manually update createdAt in PRODUCTION MODE as you can see:

Then the app from AppStore works fine, and those records are fetched and appear in the app.
What may be the reason, that they do not appear in the app?
Can I somehow set default value for those who are in cloud currently?
I have 638 records to update:(

A:

Since you told me you have to use your custom createdAt date, instead of the CKRecord's natural creationDate property, you should be able to do something like this:
func getServiceRecords() {
    let predicate:NSPredicate = NSPredicate(value: true)
    let query:CKQuery = CKQuery(recordType: "Service", predicate: predicate)

    // Create an empty array of CKRecords to append ones without createdAt value
    var empty:[CKRecord] = []

    // Perform the query
    if let database = self.publicDatabase {

        database.perform(query, inZoneWith: nil, completionHandler: { (records:[CKRecord]?, error:Error?) -> Void in

            // Check if there is an error
            if error != nil {

            }
            else if let records = records {

                for record in records {
                    if let _ = record.object(forKey: "createdAt") as! Date? {
                        // This record already has assigned creationDate and shouldnt need changing
                    } else {
                        // This record doesn't have a value create generic one and

Bob: $E_b(52)$, Eve: $E_e(193)$
Alice: $[E_a(0), ... E_a(17), E_a(19), ... E_a(200)]$, shuffle.
Alice $\mapsto$ Bob: $[E_a(i), ...]$, Bob: $[E_b(E_a(i)), ...]$, shuffle.
Bob $\mapsto$ Eve: $E_b(52)$, Eve: $E_e(E_b(52))$.
Eve $\mapsto$ Alice: $E_e(193)$, Alice: $E_a(E_e(193))$.
Alice $\mapsto$ Bob: $E_a(E_e(193))$, Bob: $E_b(E_a(E_e(193)))$.
Bob $\mapsto$ Eve: $[E_b(E_a(j)), ...]$, Eve: $[E_e(E_b(E_a(j))), ...]$, shuffle.
Eve $\mapsto$ Alice: $E_e(E_b(52))$, Alice: $E_a(E_e(E_b(52)))$.
Now the list, $E_a(E_e(E_b(52)))$ and $E_b(E_a(E_e(193)))$ can be revealed and the Bob and Eve's numbers removed. Since the encryption is commutative, $E_a(E_e(E_b(52)))$ will match $E_e(E_b(E_a(52)))$ somewhere in the list, as will $E_b(E_a(E_e(193)))$.
Everyone takes the first number in the list, say $E_e(E_b(E_a(42)))$. They each decrypt it, e.g. Bob: $D_b(E_e(E_b(E_a(42)))) = E_e(E_a(42))$. They pass them around like in step 4, so that eventually e.g. Bob gets $E_b(42)$, which he can decrypt and announce, comparing to Alice and Eve's results.

adding ID of input in the for attribute of label

I am trying to get the ID of the input and add it in the label (for="ID").

The Association Mapping I created is for meta_keyword_reference; The complete Entity is found here.
/**
 * @var int|null
 *
 * @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity="MetaKeyword")
 * @ORM\JoinColumn(name="meta_keyword_reference", referencedColumnName="reference")
 * @ORM\Column(name="meta_keyword_reference", type="bigint", nullable=true)
 */
private $metaKeywordReference;

I have not made any changes to the MetaKeywords Entity.  It is found here.  
Overall the various sections of the web site will share the meta_keywords.  If I understand correctly the connection I am trying to make is ManyToOne.  
I am wanting to leave a good reference for other newbies as they are their journey with Zend Framework 3 - Doctrine.  Please advise of edits I should be making to this post so it is clear, understandable and concise so I receive the help I need and others will benefit from this in the future.

A:

You double declared a column (meta_keyword_reference). Looking at the docs (same page you linked in question), you've made a mistake in your Annotation. Remove the ORM\Column line (the definition is already in JoinColumn). If you need it to be nullable (not required), add nullable=true to the JoinColumn; use either, not both
/**
 * @var int|null
 *
 * @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity="MetaKeyword")
 * @ORM\JoinColumn(name="meta_keyword_id", referencedColumnName="id", nullable=true)
 */
private $metaKeywordReference;

Do not worry about declaring a "type", Doctrine will automatically match it to the column you're referencing. Also, you should be referencing Primary Keys. I've assumed reference is not the PK, so I've changed it to id, change it to what it actually is. 
Next, I think you're also using DBAL QueryBuilder instead of the ORM QueryBuilder.
The Query you need would be like this:
use Doctrine\ORM\Query\Expr\Join;
use Doctrine\ORM\QueryBuilder;

/** @var QueryBuilder $qb */
$qb = $this->entityManager->createQueryBuilder();


Unable to access NAS device

I have a 3 site network A, B, and C. Each site has its own DC, that replicates to the others. Each site also has a local NAS (Thecus) device.  The NAS devices should be accessible from every other site.
I'm having an issue where the NAS device at site A cannot be reached from A's DC, but every other machine everywhere else(and with any login account) can reach the shares.  
From site A's DC, we can ping that NAS device and we can browse to the admin page.
My thought, is there must be some type of group policy restricting that machine from accessing that NAS device.  I say the machine, because the login account can access it from the same site, on different machines, and from other sites as well. If we use another login on site A's DC, we still cannot browse to the share.
Where is this type of restriction defined in group policy? I haven't had a whole lot of experience with group policy. 
Thanks!
EDIT:
I guess I forgot about an error we had received in the event logs. It's error 5722:
"The session setup from the computer  failed to authenticate. The name of the account referenced in the security database is . The following error occurred:  Access is Denied.
Update
This was resolved by applying a SMB patch for Windows Server 2008

A:

Any Group Policy would likely apply to all Domain Controllers, not just the one in Site A. Troubleshooting why one machine can't get to another machine when everything else seems to work just find can get tricky. I don't know those NAS devices at all, so I don't know if they have any useful logging on them; if this were a Windows machine I'd ask to have the security-log turned on and see what it catches for this problem.
If there are no useful logging functions to exploit in the NAS, my next step is to try and see what a connection looks like on the wire. Microsoft error reporting is not always useful, and frequently the reason for a connection failure will show up on a network trace. That does take some skill for interpretation, though.
One thing to check before delving into packets is the Local Security Policy on that DC. Make sure it looks the same as your other DC's. When talking to non-Windows devices, sometimes that can have a very big effect on

Q:

Find the Limit $\lim_{n \to \infty}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{k^{n}}{1+k^{n+2}}$

Find $\lim_{n \to \infty}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{k^{n}}{1+k^{n+2}}$
My ideas: let $ n \in \mathbb N$ be constant, looking at $\frac{k^{n}}{1+k^{n+2}}$, we know
$$\frac{k^{n}}{1+k^{n+2}}\leq\frac{k^{n}}{k^{n+2}}=\frac{1}{k^{2}}$$
but this does not help me because $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k^{2}}=\pi^{2}/6$
any ideas?

A:

Note that
$${1\over k^2}-{k^n\over1+k^{n+2}}={1\over k^2(1+k^{n+2})}$$
and, for $k\ge2$,
$${1\over k^2(1+k^{n+2})}\le{1\over2^nk^2}$$
so that
$$\sum_{k=1}^\infty{1\over k^2(1+k^{n+2})}={1\over2}+\sum_{k=2}^\infty{1\over k^2(1+k^{n+2})}\le{1\over2}+{1\over2^n}\sum_{k=2}^\infty{1\over k^2}\to{1\over2}+0={1\over2}$$
as $n\to\infty$. It follows that
$$\sum_{k=1}^\infty{k^n\over1+k^{n+2}}=\sum_{k=1}^\infty{1\over k^2}-\sum_{k=1}^\infty{1\over k^2(1+k^{n+2})}\to\sum_{k=1}^\infty{1\over k^2}-{1\over2}={\pi^2\over6}-{1\over2}$$
The key step, really, is to realize that the inequality $2^n\le1+k^{n+2}$ is not satisfied for $k

Создал простой Таймер 
  function timer() {
  setInterval(function timer() {
    var label = document.getElementById('label');
    label.innerHTML = parseInt(label.innerHTML) + 1;
}, 1000);
  }

Так вот как можно останавливать его внутри другой функции? Без использования Jquery!

A:

var i = 0;
var timerId = 0;

function timer() {
timerId = setInterval(function () {  
     //Здесь код в цикле 
     console.log(i++);
}, 1000);   
}

function stopTimer(){
clearInterval(timerId);
}
<input type="button" value="StartTimer" onclick="timer()" /> <br>
<input type="button" value="StopTimer" onclick="stopTimer()" /> 

setInterval возвращает id, который нужно передать clearInterval(id), для того чтоб остановилось, см. пример

A:

Функции setTimeout и setInterval возвращают идентификатор, который можно передать в функции остановки таймеров clearTimeout и clearInterval соответственно.
Нужно просто сохранить возвращённый id и, при надобности, передать его в очищающую функцию.
Например так:

function timer() {
  // Сохраняем в свойстве объекта функции, индивидуально и внешние переменные не нужны
  timer.id = setInterval(() => {
    let label = document.querySelector('#label');
    label.innerHTML = (parseInt(label.innerHTML) || 0) + 1;
  }, 1000);
}

// По клику запускаем таймер
document.querySelector('#start

I'm working on a site that has several hundred pdf files uploaded over the course of a few months. All uploads are organised in the uploads directory by year/month.
The client has just decided they don't want dates in their pdf urls. Instead of having the URL site.com/app/uploads/2019/06/whatever.pdf they want the url site.com/app/uploads/pdf/whatever.pdf. Note that this only applies for pdf files.
For new uploads this is easy enough. I added a filter for wp_handle_upload_prefilter that checks if the extension is pdf and changes the upload directory to uploads/pdf accordingly. However I'm not sure how to change the URL for all existing pdfs.
I looked into moving all pdfs into the uploads/pdf directory and then modifying the wp_posts GUID field to reflect the new location with
UPDATE
  `wp_posts`
SET
  guid = CONCAT(
    SUBSTRING_INDEX(guid, '/uploads', 1),
    '/uploads/pdf/',
    SUBSTRING_INDEX(guid, '/', -1)
  )
WHERE
  post_mime_type = 'application/pdf'

..but this didn't work. (done on a test site). The GUIDs were changed but the URLs remained the same.
How can I update the URLs of all pdf uploads without modifying URLs of any other upload type?

A:

It turns out the value that points to the PDFs' locations on disk is stored in the wp_postmeta table, under the meta_value field.
For example a media item located at site.com/app/uploads/2019/06/whatever.pdf would have a meta_value value of 2019/06/whatever.pdf. To change the location of all PDFs I first found the IDs of all PDFs (from the ID column in the wp_posts table, selecting where post_mime_type='application/pdf) and then, for each of those IDs, found the corresponding row in the wp_postmeta table using the post_id column and updated that row's meta_value field, replacing the year/month/ with pdf/.
I used a PHP script:
$ids = $wpdb->get_results( "SELECT * FROM `wp_posts` WHERE post_mime_type='application/

How to find out the cause of an Oracle deadlock

When testing my application with multiple users, I have encountered an ORA-00060 deadlock error. I'm not sure how to determine the cause of this error, so if anyone could help me it would be greatly appreciated.
I looked in the trace file generated for this event and it shows me which query caused this:
UPDATE TABLE_A SET CK=CK+1 WHERE A_ID=(
    SELECT A_ID FROM TABLE_B WHERE SOME_COLUMN=:SOMECOLUMN
)

It also generated this:
[Transaction Deadlock]

The following deadlock is not an ORACLE error. It is a
deadlock due to user error in the design of an application
or from issuing incorrect ad-hoc SQL. The following
information may aid in determining the deadlock:

Q:

Is a vector space a subspace of itself?

We know that a subspace (of a vector space $V$) is a vector space that follows the same addition and multiplication rules as $V$, but is a vector space a subspace of itself?

Also, I'm getting confused doing the practice questions, on when we prove that something is a vector space by using the subspace test and when we prove V1 - V10, which are the ten axioms of vector spaces. So for example in $\Bbb R^2$, we have that $\vec{x} + \vec{y} = \vec{y} + \vec {x}$, etc..

A:

Yes, every vector space is a vector subspace of itself, since it is a non-empty subset of itself which is closed with respect to addition and with respect to product by scalars.

A:

I'm guessing that V1 - V10 are the axioms for proving vector spaces.
To prove something is a vector space, independent of any other vector spaces you know of, you are required to prove all of the axioms in the definition. Not all operations that call themselves $+$ are worthy addition operations; just because you denote it $+$ does not mean it is (for example) associative, or has an additive identity.
There is a lot to prove, because there's a lot to gain. Vector spaces have a simply enormous amount of structure, and that structure gives us a really rich theory and powerful tools. If you have an object that you wish to understand better, and you can show it is a vector space (or at least, related to a vector space), then you'll instantly have some serious mathematical firepower at your fingertips.
Subspaces give us a shortcut to proving a vector space. If you have a subset of a known vector space, then you can prove just $3$ properties, rather than $10$. We can skip a lot of the steps because somebody has already done them previously when showing the larger vector space is indeed a vector space. You don't need to show, for example, $v + w = w + v$ for all $v, w$ in your subset, because we already know this is true for all vectors in the larger vector space.
I'm writing this, not as a direct answer to your question (which Jose Carlos Santos has answered already), but because confusion like this often stems from some sloppiness on the

Can it be done with recursion?

im trying to make my program run as i want it to, but i have some trouble with that, hope someone can help with that.
I wrote a program that takes a list of chars and assembles them to create words. Word ends when there is a " " in list. So it looks like that:
inp = ['r','e', 'e', 'l', ' ', 'y', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', 'w', ' ', 'g', 'e', 'l',' ', 'p','e','e','k']
outp = ['reel', 'yellow', 'gel', 'peek']

The code looks like this:
def mer(inp, outp=[]):
    tail = 0
    for item in inp:
        if item == (" "):
            inp[:tail] = ["".join(inp[:tail])]
            outp.append(inp.pop(0))
            inp.remove(item)
        if ((" ") in inp) == False:
            inp[:] = ["".join(inp[:])]
            outp.append(inp.pop(0))        
        tail +=1

And now to get the output (in the case with the input like on top) i need to call mer two times. Is there a way to make it run untill the input list is empty, or maybe use a recursion?
It's just a programming exercise, so it can be probably all done better, but for now thats all i need.

A:

You can use join and split:
>>> ''.join(inp).split()
['reel', 'yellow', 'gel', 'peek']

# recursion
from itertools import takewhile

def fun(x):
    if not x:
        return
    y = list(takewhile(lambda i:i!=' ', x))
    yield ''.join(y)
    for z in fun(x[len(y)+1:]):
        yield z

list(fun(['r','e', 'e', 'l', ' ', 'y', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', 'w', ' ', 'g', 'e', 'l

Q:

Maintain order of time series with group_by

Suppose my time series consists only of two columns: signal and day
The signal variable is supposed to repeat itself in a cycle of 1 to 6. So I need to insert empty rows for each implicit missing Signal but with signal counting from 1 to 6. (Suppose I have more columns that should also be empty (NA)). 
In other words, for each unique day, there should be 6 rows with signal counting from 1 to 6.
My dataframe:
df = structure(list(data.Signal = c(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 
1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4,

5, 6, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4),

//CSS
.price-fall { 
        background-color: #FFB0C4;
}
.price-rise {
        background-color: #B0FFC5;
}

EDIT:
There is a way of doing this with:
 function change(val){
    if(val > 0){
        return '<div class="x-grid3-cell-inner" style="background-color:#B0FFC5;"><span style="color:green;">' + val + '</span></div>';
    }else if(val < 0){
        return '<div class="x-grid3-cell-inner" style="background-color:#FFB0C4;"><span style="color:red;">' + val + '</span></div>';
    }
    return val || 0;
}

and then just:
...
{header: 'Change', width: 75, sortable: true, renderer: change, dataIndex: 'change', align: 'center'}
...

but this way grid gets deformed on changes from white to colored background... ???
any other ideas?
EDIT
After custom css is applyed to the column, how to remove the same in a short period of time, so it appears to blink once when the value has changed? Something like setTimeout("remove-css()",1000); or with Ext.Function.defer(remove-css, 1000);
Any ideas?

A:

I suggest using getRowClass with applying extra cls to needed columns:

Ext.create('Ext.grid.Panel', {
    columns: [
        // ...
        { header: 'Change', dataIndex: 'change', tdCls: 'x-change-cell' },
        // ...
    ],

    viewConfig: {
        getRowClass: function(record, index) {
            var c = record.get('change');
            if (c < 0) {
                return 'price-fall';
            } else if (c > 0) {
                return 'price-rise';
            }
        }
    },
    // ...
});

.price-fall .x-change-cell {
    background-color: #FFB0C4;
    color:red;
}

Q:

.NET Design: Bubbling up exceptions to better refactor entity consumers, is it a good practice?

Not sure it's best place to discuss this question since it's kinda broad so I'm gonna attempt to narrow down the scope a bit.
My Background
Back the other day, I asked a couple of questions about some design decisions in to the manager of the team I recently joined. I'm working on a trading application for a corporate investment bank and there is quite a lot of legacy code (like in any other software application that has survived to changes for more than 5 years).    
To make it short, it seems a common practice here to not throw any exception and not really checking the arguments passed to a method or to a constructor. While I agree that there are cases where arguments check is worthless, it might help to throw an exception when certain types or range of values cannot work with you method.
People are using TDD here and I'm fine with that but I don't think everything can be prevented with that practice. But swallowing exceptions and letting other disasters happen in silence is in no way any better, tests help in many to prevent this kind of problem to occur, but not always.
It's always a matter a context, but in my past a job putting exceptions helped my team a lot to improve the code quality, by bubbling up all the problems we got, mostly by pointing out the exceptional values passes to some entities, ah legacy code... again) and proceeding to an appropriate refactoring.
Problem / Scenario
Say if I have a type A used by a type B, generally-speaking to throw up an exception from A in the face of B in the case of B is misusing A (e.g. value out of range, etc.), is that really a bad practice? It's supposed to help B to process A in the right way (e.g. passing right arguments to the constructor, etc.). When you look at the .NET framework there are plenty of exceptions when you misuse classes then exceptions are raised and let you know that it's not supposed to work with this or that.
Again, exceptions are supposed to be exceptional but if we take an example of a very simple entity or method parsing an IP address, the .NET Framework gently let you know that the string passed is not okay for that: 
var address = IPAddress.Parse(@"It makes sense =]");
// An unhandled exception of type

The question boils down to the distinction between an attributive (the auspicious day) and predicate (the day is auspicious) adjective. I think it is necessarily a predicate adjective, as Browne/Swallow have it. I see two reasons.  

The word order and position of the article in ἡ ἀρχὴ δεξιὰ are that of a subject/predicate noun clause rather than an nominal phrase with an attributive adjective. 

If the noun is articular but the adjective is anarthrous...then the adjective is functioning as a predicate adjective.1 

Recall that the constructions that are acceptable representations of an attributive relationship (if at least one article is present) are 

ἡ δεξιὰ ἀρχὴ (=first attributive position, ~=English); and 
ἡ ἀρχὴ ἡ δεξιὰ (=second attributive position); and
ἀρχὴ ἡ δεξιὰ (=third attributive position, uncommon).

It’s hard for me to see how a nominative phrase could make a semantically agreeable sentence.  

?It is Resurrection Day, and the auspicious beginning, and let us keep the Festival...

I suppose you’re thinking of an appositive relationship (?). (It is Resurrection Day, that is, the auspicious beginning...) The lack of concordance in definiteness is a bit disconcerting, although I’m not sure that’s (for lack of a better word) definitive. The introjection of καὶ is also unusual for simple apposition.

Primarily for the first reason, and supported by the second, I read this clause as a predicate adjective, according with the Browne/Swallow translation quoted above.3 

1. Admittedly, my grammar is about 300 years outdated for this question, but I offer it anyway as possibly helpful.
 

2. William D. Mounce. Basics of Biblical Greek. Zondervan, 2009: pp 67-68.

3. The details of how it is construed as auspicious and mine are not totally transparent to me, but that doesn’t seem to be bothering you. I suspect there is a semantic association between ἡμέρα and δεξιὸς that pushes the latter in the direction of “ausp

I have rewritten this problem exactly as it appears in a recreational math book I have, but it is driving me crazy. I feel like there isn't enough information. The answer is claimed to be $34$, but no step-by-step solution is offered any assistance would be appreciated.

A:

Let's say the man's age is M, his wife's W, his son's S, and his daughter's D. Then we have $M = W + 1$, so $W = M - 1$. The product of their ages is $17$ times the product of the ages of their son and their daughter: $M(M-1) = 17SD$. $D = S - 1$. So we have $M(M-1) = 17S(S-1)$.
One significant factor is that $M$ and $S$ must be whole numbers, and $M(M-1)$ must be divisible by $17$, which means either $M$ or $M - 1$ is divisible by $17$. So $M$ must be $17, 18, 34, 35, 51, 52, 68, 69, 85, 86$ (or a few more options, depending on the man's lifespan).
The next relevant issue is divisibility by $3$. Modulo $3$, $n(n - 1)$ must be either $0$ or $2$. If $S(S-1)$ is $2$ mod $3$, then $17S(S-1)$ is $1$ mod $3$ and no value of $M$ will work; so it must be that $S(S-1)$ is divisible by $3$ (so $M(M-1)$ is as well). Now our options for $M$ are reduced to $18, 34, 51, 52, 69,$ or $85$. This is small enough to check.
$18(18 - 1) = 18 \cdot 17$, so $S(S - 1) = 18$. No integer $S$ works for this.
$34(34 - 1) = 66 \cdot 17$, so $S(S - 1) = 66$. No integer $S$ works for this.
$51(51 - 1) = 150 \cdot 17$, so $S(S - 1) = 150$. No integer $S$ works for this, either.
$52(52 - 1

This should be displaying a smiley face in black against a white background but definitely is not. I know this is totally wrong, I've been trying for ages and that was just a very desperate attempt that I was just hoping to work.

A:

You are giving constant arguments to the drawing function. You need to change the coordinates according to the matrix.
for example:
square_size = 30 # example
for y, row in enumerate(blockMap):
    for x, val in enumerate(row):

        upper_left_point = x * square_size, y * square_size
        upper_right_point = (x + 1) * square_size, y * square_size
        lower_left_point = x * square_size, (y + 1) * square_size
        lower_right_point = (x + 1) * square_size, (y + 1) * square_size

        pointlist = [upper_left_point, 
                    upper_right_point,
                    lower_right_point,
                    lower_left_point]

        pygame.draw.polygon(Surface, color, pointlist, width=0)

This is a very basic example, so try fully understanding the code before using it.

Chamada de evento em outro evento

Possuo no meu código o evento dgvCellValueChanged que será acionado quando algum valor da grife for alterado, ele calcula o valor da coluna 0 * coluna 1( Valor 1 * Valor 2) e atribui a coluna total esse resultado.
Ex: 
private void dgvCellValueChanged(objectivo Sender, DatagridViewCellEventArgs e)
{
    Dgv.Rows[e.RowIndex].Cells["Total"]. Valeu = Double.Parse( 
    Int36.Parse(Dgv.Rows[e.RowIndex].Cells["Valor 1"]. Value) * 
    Int36.Parse(Dgv.Rows[e.RowIndex].Cells["Valor 2"]. Value));
}

O que eu desejo saber é se alguém aqui sabe me informar se existe uma maneira de chamar esse método dentro do método 
private void dgvMouseMove(objectivo Sender, MouseEventArgs e) { }

A:

Como a assinatura dos métodos são diferentes, uma boa ideia é criar um método intermediário que seja chamado pelos dois eventos.
private void Metodo(int rowIndex)
{
    Dgv.Rows[rowIndex].Cells["Total"]. Valeu = Double.Parse( 
    Int36.Parse(Dgv.Rows[rowIndex].Cells["Valor 1"]. Value) * 
    Int36.Parse(Dgv.Rows[rowIndex].Cells["Valor 2"]. Value));
}

Aí é só alterar os métodos dos eventos para fazer a chamada.
private void dgvCellValueChanged(objectivo Sender, DatagridViewCellEventArgs e) 
    => Metodo(e.RowIndex);

provate void dgvMouseMove(objectivo Sender, MouseEventArgs e) 
{    
    int rowIndex = Dgv.HitTest(e.X, e.Y).RowIndex; // Obtém o índice da linha clicada
    if(rowIndex < 0) return;
    Metodo(rowIndex);

Implicit Encoder for TypedDataset and Type Bounds in Scala

My objective is to create a MyDataFrame class that will know how to fetch data at a given path, but I want to provide type-safety. I'm having some trouble using a frameless.TypedDataset with type bounds on remote data. For example
sealed trait Schema
final case class TableA(id: String) extends Schema
final case class TableB(id: String) extends Schema

class MyDataFrame[T <: Schema](path: String, implicit val spark: SparkSession) {
  def read = TypedDataset.create(spark.read.parquet(path)).as[T]
} 

But I keep getting could not find implicit value for evidence parameter of type frameless.TypedEncoder[org.apache.spark.sql.Row]. I know that TypedDataset.create needs an Injection for this to work. But I'm not sure how I would write this for a generic T. I thought the compiler would be able to deduce that since all subtypes of Schema are case classes that it would work.
Anybody ever run into this?

A:

All implicit parameters should be in the last parameter list and this parameter list should be separate from non-implicit ones.
If you try to compile
class MyDataFrame[T <: Schema](path: String)(implicit spark: SparkSession) {
  def read = TypedDataset.create(spark.read.parquet(path)).as[T]
}

you'll see error
Error:(11, 35) could not find implicit value for evidence parameter of type frameless.TypedEncoder[org.apache.spark.sql.Row]
    def read = TypedDataset.create(spark.read.parquet(path)).as[T]

So let's just add corresponding implicit parameter
class MyDataFrame[T <: Schema](path: String)(implicit spark: SparkSession, te: TypedEncoder[Row]) {
  def read = TypedDataset.create(spark.read.parquet(path)).as[T]
}

we'll have error
Error:(11, 64) could not find implicit value for parameter as: frameless.ops.As[org.apache.spark.sql.Row,T]

Well if you are using laravel then you can use the power of carbon and collection methods to solve such kinds of issues. 
You can map the array key and group them by using carbon method. Check the following snippets will give you the exact result.
date_default_timezone_set("Asia/Kolkata");
$resultSet = [ 
   0 => [
     'id' => 127,
     'name' => 'XYZ',
     'start_date' => '2020-01-03 20:00:00'
   ], 
   1 => [
     'id' => 128,
     'name' => 'GHJ',
     'start_date' => '2020-01-04 20:00:00'
   ], 
   2 => [
     'id' => 129,
     'name' => 'GHJK',
     'start_date' => '2020-01-05 16:00:00'
   ], 
   3 => [
     'id' => 130,
     'name' => 'GHL',
     'start_date' => '2020-01-05 20:00:00'
   ], 
   4 => [
     'id' => 131,
     'name' => 'JKL',
     'start_date' => '2020-01-18 20:00:00'
   ]
];

in case if you want the future date will be in "in_future" key.
$output = collect($resultSet)->map(function ($value) {
    $group_by_key = Carbon::parse($value['start_date']);
    switch ($group_by_key) {
        case $group_by_key->isToday():
            $group_by_key = 'today';
            break;
        case $group_by_key->isTomorrow():
            $group_by_key = 'tomorrow';
            break;
        case $group_by_key->isNextWeek():
            $group_by_key = 'next_week';
            break;
        case $group_by_key->weekOfYear > Carbon::now()->addWeek()->weekOfYear:
            $group_by_key = 'in_future

I have some C++ unit tests using google test. Threw together some code to override the new/delete operators to check for leaks in the unit tests. Having an issue though. Some of the google test new/deletes use my overridden methods, but some don't, so I get false errors in the tracking code -- sometimes seeing that memory was leaked even though it was really deleted and sometimes seeing that malloc returns 
Here is my minimal new/delete overrides (just prints the addresses for manual inspection):
void * operator new(size_t size)
{
  void * addr = malloc(size);
  std::cout << "    tracking create: " << addr << "(size " << size << ")" << std::endl;
  return addr;
}
void * operator new[](size_t size)
{
  void * addr = malloc(size);
  std::cout << "    tracking create: " << addr << "(size " << size << ")" << std::endl;
  return addr;
}

void operator delete(void * addr) noexcept
{
  std::cout << "    tracking delete: " << addr << std::endl;
  free(addr);
}

void operator delete[](void * addr) noexcept
{
  std::cout << "    tracking delete: " << addr << std::endl;
  free(addr);
}

And here is the google test line that does NOT go through my overridden delete (gtest-port.h):
void reset(T* p = NULL) {
    if (p != ptr_) {
      if (IsTrue(sizeof(T) > 0)) {  // Makes sure T is a complete type.
        delete ptr_;
      }
      ptr_ = p;
    }
  }

When I break on the delete ptr_ line in gdb, then step, it steps directly to the ptr_ = p line, so there isn't something else overriding that delete.
I'm building gtest as an archive file and linking it in when I build my unit tests. In case it matters: I'm on windows building with mingw using cygwin.
Here's a minimal example, 2 files min.cpp and minmain.cpp. Here's min.cpp:
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

Alternate colors in quiver plots

I am experimenting to find a good way to do a 3d vector field plot of a magnetic field of a thin wire. One idea was to use a different color for each fixed z value. I just tried to use cycle list, but this doesn't seem to work with quiver plots. How can I make it work:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{pgfplots}
\pgfplotsset{
  compat=newest,
  }
\begin{document}

\begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{axis}[
    domain=-10:10,
    samples=10,
    xmin=-10,xmax=10,

    zmin=-10,zmax=10,
    cycle list name=color,

Получаю сигнал (от 3 кГц до 125 кГц) на ICP1 (ATmega16), и не знаю как правильно рассчитать период между импульсами (между нисходящим и восходящим фронтами). Нужно определить, что между импульсами - период или два периода. Как это можно реализовать на СИ?
Прошу помощи советом в нужном направлении или примером кода.

A:

Например в лоб, можно так:
#include <time.h>

double elapsed; // in milliseconds
clock_t start, end;

start = clock();

// ваш код между приходом сигнала

end = clock();

elapsed = ((double) (end - start) * 1000) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;

Второй, более точный (все относительно) вариант в лоб:
#include <sys/time.h>
unsigned long start,end;
rdtscl(start);
// ваш код по отлову импульсов...
rdtscl(end);

printf("cpu clics: %lu\n",(end-start));

если rtdscl не обнаружено :) можно не отчаиваться и перейти к его реализации:
 #define rdtscl(dest) \
    __asm__ __volatile__("mfc0 %0,$9; nop" : "=r" (dest))

Есть ещё такой подход:
#include <sys/time.h>

   timespec ts;
   clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &ts); // FreeBSD
   clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, &ts); // Linux

I often find my answers on this site without, but on this occasion I need more personalized assistance. I hope someone can point me in the right direction.
I have been messing around with trying to draw a report off my NAS system to get statistics of the Age of Data and the Size of data so I can attempt to provide a Charge Back/Show back solution. 
I have managed to do this mostly with Powershell using get-childitem and I have even trying to tap into .net using [System.IO.Directory]::EnumerateDirectories, 
and other commands. All these solutions work, but I seem to get really slow times getting this information, especially if I compare this to Jam TreeSize which fishes this information out fairly quickly. 
to note, I have even tried multi-threading in powershell, thinking if I can collect the data from various points it would collect the whole data would be quicker, but I have had largely mix results. 
I'm hoping someone else has tackled this sort of project before and managed to get a nice quick(er) way of doing this. I am even open to other languages tackling this.
Quick notes, I am doing this in powershell v5. I have also started learning a bit of python so if anyone has suggestion in that it would be a great place for me to learn.
Edit:
OK Here are some examples. 
Times: 
Treesize takes 10 seconds 
Powershell Get-ChildItem takes about 2minutes 
Powershell dotnet actions takes about 2 minutes 
Number of objects counted 60 000 objects, size 120gb. 
get-childitem with recurse will get you all file objects in a specified location including their attributes, such as last accessed time and size in bytes dotnet you need to use a combination of EnumerateFiles etc and then loop that with FileInfo which is get the file objects in the given location and then inspect their attributes respectively
In terms of multithreading I will point you to some links which I used, it will be too much to add in here, but I have tried creating a runspacepool, but I also tried manually running two separate runspaces to compare results and they were much the same. why I am obsessed with times, while the test directory I am using above is only 2 minutes, my NAS in some volumes has millions of files. The one test I did took an hour and a half

How to print a key to the value entered by the user in python

I'm using python 3.6 and I have to print the key to the value entered by the user. I'm given a long list of provinces and first letters associated with their postal code so that when the user enters a 6 letter postal code, the program will print the province in which that postal code resides.
* I am NOT allowed to use if statements, loops or lists.*
This is what I have so far:
    data = {}

    # Initialize dictionary so that it maps from Province to correlated first letter         
    data = {"Alberta": "T",
            "British Columbia":"V",
            "Manitoba":"R",
            "New Brunswick": "E",
            "Newfoundland":"A",
            "Nova Scotia": "B",
            "Nunavut": "X",
            "Northwest Territories": "X",
            "Ontario": ["K,L,M,N,P"],
            "Prince Edward Island": "C",
            "Quebec":"[G,H,J]",
            "Saskatchewan":"S",
            "Yukon":"Y"}

    # Read a postal code from the user

    key = input("Enter a 6 character postal code (A1A1A1): ")

    #computer letters to uppercase
    key = key.upper()
    print("That postal code resides in", (data[key]))

However it gives me an error message with the print (data[key]) statement. I'm also struggling to figure out a way so that I can take the 6 values entered and print the province with no error as my provinces are correlated with one value. I just learned dictionaries and I'm having troubles solving this. ANY help would be great!! thanks so much. 

A:

Dictionary is declared with <key>:<value> order, so you'd better switch you dictionary to "T": "Alberta" and then you can do your task without if-statements and loops
data = {"T": "Alberta",
        "V":"British Columbia",
        "R":"Manitoba",
        "E":"New Brunswick",
        "A":"Newfoundland",
        "B":"Newfoundland",
        "X":["Nunavut","North

... into something like
async coro_top():
  print('top')
  await coro_1()
  await coro_2()

async coro_1()
  print('1')
  # ... More asyncio code

async coro_2()
  print('2')
  # ... More asyncio code

However, the extra awaits mean that these are not strictly equivalent

Another concurrent task can run code between print('top') and print('1'), so makes race conditions a touch more likely for certain algorithms.
There is (presumably) a slight overhead in yielding the event loop

So is there a way of calling a coroutine without yielding the event loop in order to avoid the above?

A:

The premise of the question is incorrect: contrary to what people tend to expect, an await doesn't automatically yield to the event loop. You can easily test that:
async def noop():
    pass

async def busy_loop(msg):
    while True:
        print(msg)
        await noop()

# keeps printing 'a', the event loop is stuck
asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(
    asyncio.gather(busy_loop('a'), busy_loop('b')))

Although busy_loop awaits the whole time, it still blocks the event loop, so that other tasks will not run, and even cancelling it is impossible. This is because the noop coroutine it awaits never suspends execution.
await some_coroutine() doesn't mean "schedule some_coroutine() and yield to the event loop, resuming when it completes". It means "start executing some_coroutine() and, if/when it chooses to suspend, suspend along", and assuming the former can lead to bugs.
In other words, the broken-up code really is equivalent to the code before the refactoring. The only way for another task to execute between print('top') and print('1') is for a new await to be added between them (one that actually suspends the coroutine), but the same can be said of the original code as well.

There is (presumably) a slight overhead in yielding the event loop

The overhead exists, but it is comparable to the

<div class="main">
    Welcome
</div>

Now here I gave a class to the div and it's also doing the same job for me.
Then what is the exact difference between Id and class and when should I use id and when should I use class.? I am a newbie in CSS and Web-design and a little bit confused while dealing with this.

A:

Use a class when you want to consistently style multiple elements throughout the page/site. Classes are useful when you have, or possibly will have in the future, more than one element that shares the same style. An example may be a div of "comments" or a certain list style to use for related links. 
Additionally, a given element can have more than one class associated with it, while an element can only have one id. For example, you can give a div two classes whose styles will both take effect.
Furthermore, note that classes are often used to define behavioral styles in addition to visual ones. For example, the jQuery form validator plugin heavily uses classes to define the validation behavior of elements (e.g. required or not, or defining the type of input format)
Examples of class names are: tag, comment, toolbar-button, warning-message, or email.
Use the ID when you have a single element on the page that will take the style. Remember that IDs must be unique. In your case this may be the correct option, as there presumably will only be one "main" div on the page.
Examples of ids are: main-content, header, footer, or left-sidebar.

A good way to remember this is a class is a type of item and the id is the unique name of an item on the page.

A:

ids are unique

Each element can have only one id 
Each page can have only one element with that id

classes are NOT unique

You can use the same class on multiple elements.
You can use multiple classes on the same element.

Javascript cares
JavaScript people are already probably more in tune with the differences between classes and ids. JavaScript depends on there being only one page element with any particular id, or else the commonly used getElementById function couldn't be depended on.

Css Expression not working in IE11

We developed a application with older Version of IE7.
And the code contains "CSS expression" but this not working in IE11.
Sample code :
div#GridViewContainer
        {
            position: relative !important;
            width: 1000px !important;
            overflow: auto !important;
        }
        _:-ms-fullscreen, :root .staticHeader
        {
            position: relative !important;
            top: expression(this.offsetParent.scrollTop);
            z-index: 99 !important;
        }
        _:-ms-fullscreen, :root .StaticColumn
        {
            z-index: 90 !important;
            border: 1px solid gray !important;
            position: relative !important;
           left: expression(document.getElementById("GridViewContainer").scrollLeft);
        }

How to make work in IE11 and alternative way to do this?
How alter my code?

A:

You could do the same using pure JavaScript and get rid of CSS expressions all together.

OR

If you are feeling lazy or dont want to use JS, try setting the Document mode:
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=EmulateIE7" />

add it to the <head>...</head> section.
Note that this can possibly break the properties not supported by IE7 that you may have used.

Why you should avoide using CSS Expressions:

Starting with Internet Explorer 11, CSS expressions are no longer
  enabled for webpages loaded in the Internet zone. CSS expressions are
  supported for pages loaded in other zones (such as the intranet zone)
  when pages are rendered in IE7 standards mode or IE5 quirks mode.
-CSS expressions no longer supported for the Internet zone

Also,

Unfortunately, the performance penalty imposed by CSS expressions is
  considerable, as the browser reevaluates each expression whenever any
  event is triggered, such as a window resize, a mouse movement and so
  on. The poor performance of CSS expressions is one of the reasons they
  are now deprecated in IE 8. If you have used CSS expressions in your
  pages, you should make every effort to remove them and use other

Java accessing private property via Reflection

I have following package structure and classes.
package  X 
    Class A
        private string fieldX;
        protected string getFieldX(){ return fieldX};

package Y
    Class B extends A
    Class C extends B

I have the ClassC object and trying to get fieldX via reflection.
Class partypes[] = new Class[0];
Object arglist[] = new Object[0];
Method getContextMethod = ClassC.class.getMethod("getFieldX",partypes);
String retValue =  (string) getContextMethod.invoke(classCInstance, arglist);

But I am getting NoSuchMethod exception.
I tried also reach the fieldX directly. But this time I am getting NoSuchField Exception.
Field reqField = ClassC.class.getDeclaredField("fieldX");
reqField.setAccessible(true);
Object value = reqField.get(classCInstance);
String retValue =  (string) value;

What is the thing I am doing wrong?
Is there a way to get this fieldX from ClassC object?
Solution: (thanks a lot vz0 for solution);
Direct access to private field:
Field reqField = ClassA.class.getDeclaredField("fieldX");
reqField.setAccessible(true);
String value = (String)reqField.get(clazzc);

Method Call;
Class partypes[] = new Class[0];
Object arglist[] = new Object[0];

getContextMethod.setAccessible(true);
System.out.println((String)getContextMethod.invoke(clazzc, arglist));

A:

The Class.getMethod call is for public methods only. You need to use the Class.getDeclaredMethod call and then setting the Method.setAccessible property to true:
Class partypes[] = new Class[0];
Object arglist[] = new Object[0];
Method getContextMethod = ClassA.class.getDeclaredMethod("getFieldX",partypes);

getContextMethod.setAccessible(true);

I have a need to loop through JSON file and I'm using AngularJS for that. The function is as follows:
<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.0.7/angular.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        function PostsCtrlAjax($scope, $http) {
        $http({method: 'POST', url: 'posts.json'}).success(function(data) {
                $scope.tasks = data;
            });
        }
</script>
<div id="ng-app" ng-app ng-controller="PostsCtrlAjax"> 
        <div ng-repeat="task in tasks.objects">
<script type="text/javascript">     
var adviser1 = new primitives.orgdiagram.ItemConfig("{{task.name}}", "{{task.description}}", "http://www.basicprimitives.com/demo/images/photos/z.png");
</script>
</div>
</div>

By using the following code {{task.name}} and description are being printed as just {{task.name}}, how can I make it print out the content of that variable? And if I'm not using quotes, it doesn't show anything.
How can I fix that?

A:

I think you need to review your code design. The idea of having <script> tag inside a ng-repeat doesn't look best practice to me.
You could create simple directive that could be placed inside the ng-repeat. Every time one of the directives is instantiated by the loop you could run your function new primitives.orgdiagram.ItemConfig() with all the parameters you need.
I've created something similar but instead of calling your function, I am printing on the console.

I want to create a date array and sort it. This is how I was able to do it but this is not what I required. 
   java.text.SimpleDateFormat sdf = new java.text.SimpleDateFormat("dd-MM-yyyy");
   java.util.Date date1 = sdf.parse("05-03-2014");
   java.util.Date date2 = sdf.parse("23-08-2014");
   java.util.Date dates[] = {date1, date2};
   java.util.Arrays.sort(dates);
   System.out.println(java.util.Arrays.toString(dates));

Because I have a String array "String dates[] = {"05-11-2014", "23-08-2014","05-02-2013"};"
So I have to sort the dates in the string array. How do I change my code?

A:

The better way would be to convert the String array to an array of Date
Date[] arrayOfDates = new Date[dates.length];
for (int index = 0; index < dates.length; index++) {
    arrayOfDates[index] = sdf.parse(dates[index]);
}

Then sort the arrayOfDates and if you need to, use the SimpleDateFormat to format the results back to the dates array...
Arrays.sort(arrayOfDates);
for (int index = 0; index < dates.length; index++) {
    dates[index] = sdf.format(arrayOfDates[index]);
}

This provides you with much more control over what you should do if one or more of the values in the dates array is an invalid format.
Another, "dirty" solution, would be to use a custom Comparator that would convert the values to a Date inline and compare them.
This is okay if you can guarantee the validity of the dates, but starts to fall apart when you can't, for example...
import java.text.ParseException;
import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Comparator;
import java.util.logging.Level;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

A:

The first question is, what tradition are you following?
In the reconstructed Classical pronunciation, the way scholars think Romans spoke around the first century, they'd be pronounced [kʷɛ] and [ˈɑŋ.gɛ.liː]. In English, approximately "kweh" and "AHNG-geh-lee".
In the common Ecclesiastic pronunciation, the system the Vatican uses, they'd be pronounced [kʷe] [ˈɑn.d͡ʒɛ.li]. In English, approximately "kway" and "AHN-jeh-lee".
However, there have been a wide variety of Latin pronunciations used across the centuries. It's worth asking which your chorus is using: while most use Ecclesiastic pronunciation, for example, some choruses would use a German pronunciation for Bach, but an Italian pronunciation for Palestrina.

Some of these regional pronunciations used [k] instead of [kʷ] before [e], as you mention in the comments—based on how the Romance languages developed, I would expect this in France and Spain, but not in Portugal or Italy (or Germany or England for that matter). In Germany or Russia, on the other hand, you'd find something more like [kv].
However, these regional pronunciations aren't generally used nowadays, unless you're singing music by a specifically French or Spanish composer. You should talk to your director about that.

A:

It depends on the pronunciation you are using.
If you want classical reconstructed pronunciation, the one Romans used, you say something like [kwe] and [ˈaŋ.ɡɛ.li].
If you want ecclesiastical pronunciation, which is used by the Catholic Church, you say some thing like [kwe] and [ˈan.d͡ʒe.li]
I hope it helped.

A:

Note: This answer should be regarded as an adjunct to the answers already given by user22198 and Draconis.
Both correctly mention that there are different traditions in pronouncing Latin, including a reconstructed Classical pronunciation, and an "Ecclesiastical" pronunciation.  There also have existed various national pronunciations, as Draconis mentions.

Following http://sickel.net/blogg/?p=1284, I added error bars to your bar plot as follows.
First, I run the code that defines the sample data (i. e. everything until the line that defines lizard.matrix. After that, the plot can be created by the following code:
# create bar plot
bp <- barplot(lizards.matrix,
              beside=T,
              col=col,
              ylim=c(0,100),
              xlab="Site",ylab="Frequency",
              legend.text=row.names(lizards.matrix),
              args.legend=list(x="top",bty="n"),
              las=1,
              cex.axis=1.2)

# create matrix of errors
lizards.error = matrix(c(10, 5, 12, 10, 8, 6, 12, 28, 3), ncol = 3)

# add vertical part of error bars
segments(bp, lizards.matrix - lizards.error, bp, lizards.matrix + lizards.error)

# horizontal parts of error bars
ew <- (bp[2,1]-bp[1,1])/4
segments(bp - ew, lizards.matrix - lizards.error, bp + ew, lizards.matrix - lizards.error)
segments(bp - ew, lizards.matrix + lizards.error, bp + ew, lizards.matrix + lizards.error)

The code works as follows:

I take advantage of the fact, that barplot() returns a matrix containing the horizontal coordinates of the bars. Therefore, I store the output of barplot() in the variable bp for later use. Note also, that I changed the range for ylim() to make sure that there is enough room in the plot for the error bars.
Then I define lizards.error which contains the error for each of the bars in the plot. Its structure follows that of lizards.matrix. So lizards.error[1, 1] contains the error for the bar with height `lizards.matrix[1, 1].
The error bars are then drawn using the function segments(). As many plot functions in base R, this function adds something to an existing plot. Its four relevant arguments are x

Q:

What is the relationship between Application Pools and worker process threads?

I'm troubleshooting restarts in an ASP.NET application. The application is restarting about 20 times a day. We strongly suspect one part of the application because the restarts began when this particular feature when into production. I've added some logging to those pages using the log4net library, but I'm having trouble interpreting the logs.
When an ASP.NET application is running in an Application Pool, does only a single instance of that application run, or will multiple instances of that application run? I know several worker process threads will be spawned. What is the relationship of the worker process threads to the application(s) running in the App Pool?
I am thinking that I may not be interpreting the results correctly if there are multiple applications logging to the same log. If one is restarted but the other is not, the logs aren't really telling me much about what was happening when the restart occurred.
UPDATE 1
Looking at this page, I find the following information:

An application pool defines a group of one or more worker processes, configured with common settings that serve requests to one or more applications that are assigned to that application pool. Because application pools allow a set of Web applications to share one or more similarly configured worker processes, they provide a convenient way to isolate a set of Web applications from other Web applications on the server computer. Process boundaries separate each worker process; therefore, application problems in one application pool do not affect Web sites or applications in other application pools.

But I am still confused. I know from experience that I can assign two entirely different applications to use the same App Pool. Does that mean that exactly two worker processes will be spawned? Or can there be multiple worker processes spawned for the first app, and multiple worker processes spawned for the second app? If a problem happens in one worker process, can it take down every application running in that App Pool?
UPDATE 2
From this page about using WinDbg, I found this information (emphasis mine):

In IIS 5.x, there is only one Aspnet_wp.exe worker process and one debugger thread. Consequently, only one debugger can be attached to the Aspnet_wp.exe process at a time. This can pose a problem if you're dealing with multiple Web applications on the same machine. In IIS 6.0, you can coerce an AppDomain to run in

Using SQL Server, I have a Contact table that contains the name and address of my contacts. I have several instances of multiple contacts living at the same address. When sending my newsletter, I only want to send it to each address one time. How can I modify the query below to only display the first contact at each address?
SELECT 
   dbo_Contact.Contact_Title AS Title, 
   dbo_Contact.Contact_FirstName AS [First Name],
   dbo_Contact.Contact_LastName AS [Last Name], 
   dbo_Contact.Contact_Suffix AS Suffix,
   dbo_Contact.Business_Name AS [Business Name], 
   dbo_Contact.Contact_Address1 AS [Address 1],
   dbo_Contact.Contact_Address2 AS [Address 2], 
   dbo_Contact.Contact_City AS City,
   dbo_Contact.Contact_State AS State, 
   dbo_Contact.Contact_Zip AS Zip,
   dbo_Contact.Contact_Email AS Email
FROM 
   dbo_Contact 
INNER JOIN 
   dbo_Mailing_Subscribers ON dbo_Contact.[ContactID] = dbo_Mailing_Subscribers.[ContactID]
WHERE 
   (((dbo_Contact.Contact_Inactive) = False) 
    AND ((dbo_Mailing_Subscribers.Mailing_ID) = True)
    AND ((dbo_Mailing_Subscribers.Subscribed) = True));

For example, if Kurt and William live at 123 A Street and Steve lives at 123 B Avenue, I would only want to return records for Kurt and Steve.

A:

Okay, here is my solution.
1 - Use table aliases to reduce code foot print.
2 - Changed true/false to 1/0 to meet TSQL Boolean values.
3 - Create RowNum partition by address1, address2, zip code order by last name, first name.
4 - Select only one row from the duplicates.
;
with cteData as
(
SELECT 
   C.Contact_Title AS Title, 
   C.Contact_FirstName AS [First Name],
   C.Contact_LastName AS [Last Name], 
   C.Contact_Suffix AS Suffix,

We can mask the column 'diff' in the final output and it should look like below:
| id |    Date    | Buyer_id |
|----|:----------:|---------:|
| 9  | 11/29/2018 |    Jenny |
| 9  | 11/29/2018 |    Jenny |
| 9  | 11/29/2018 |    Jenny |
| 5  | 2/13/2019  | Chunfei  |
| 5  | 2/16/2019  | Chunfei  |
| 5  | 2/16/2019  | Chunfei  |
| 5  | 2/23/2019  | Chunfei  |
| 5  | 2/25/2019  | Chunfei  |
| 8  | 2/28/2019  | Chunfei  |
| 8  | 2/28/2019  | Chunfei  |

A:

We can use diff to subtract Date and select groups where there is at-least one value which is less than equal to 5 days.
library(dplyr)

df %>%
  group_by(id, Buyer) %>%
  filter(any(diff(Date) <= 5))

#      id Date       Buyer  
#   <dbl> <date>     <chr>  
# 1     9 2018-11-29 Jenny  
# 2     9 2018-11-29 Jenny  
# 3     9 2018-11-29 Jenny  
# 4     5 2018-05-25 Chunfei
# 5     5 2019-02-13 Chunfei
# 6     5 2019-02-16 Chunfei
# 7     5 2019-02-16 Chunfei
# 8     5 2019-02-23 Chunfei
# 9     5 2019-02-25 Chunfei
#10     8 2019-02-28 Chunfei
#11     8 2019-02-28 Chunfei

After re-reading the question I think you might not be looking to filter entire groups but only those rows which have difference of 5 days. We can get indices which have diff value of less than 5 and select it's previous index as well. 
df %>%


I have a weird problem, so I thought I would ask and see if someone more experienced than me could see a solution.
I am writing a program with CUDA C/C++, and I have some constant integers that specify various things, like coordinates of the bounds of the calculation, etc.. Currently I just have those things in global device memory. They are accessed by every thread in every kernel call, and so I figured that if they are in global memory, then they never are being cached or broadcast (right?). And so these little integers are taking up a lot (relatively) of overhead, and have a lot of 'read redundancy.'
So I declare in a header:
__constant__ int* number;

I include that header, and, when I do memory stuff, I do:
cutilSafeCall( cudaMemcpyToSymbol(number, &(some_host_int), sizeof(int) );

I pass number into all my kernel's then:
__global__ void magical_kernel(int* number, ...){

   //and I access 'number' like this
   int data_thingy = big_array[ *number ];

}

My code crashes. With number in global memory, it is just fine. I have determined that it crashes sometime upon accessing number within the kernel. This means that either I am accessing or allocating it wrong. If it holds the wrong value, it will also cause a crash, because it is used to index into arrays.
To conclude, I will ask a few questions. First, what am I doing wrong? As a bonus: is there a better way than constant memory to accomplish this task - I don't know the value of number at compile time, so a simple #define won't work. Will constant memory even speed the code up at all, or has it been cached and broadcasted all along? Could I somehow put the data in shared memory for each threadblock and have it remain in shared memory through multiple kernel calls?

A:

There are several problems here:

You have declared number as a pointer, but never assigned it a value which is valid address in GPU memory
You have a variable scope onflict: the argument variable int * number defined in magic_kernel is not the same variable as the __constant__ int * variable defined as compilation unit scope.
The first argument of the cudaMemcpyToSymbol call is almost certainly incorrect

The conditions needs to evaluate to true, false or null. In order to do that, you will have to use one of the comparison operators: =, <, >,

A:

Some kind of indirection is necessary for complex programs (e.g. recursive or variable-sized data structures). However, it is not necessary to implement this indirection via pointers.
The majority of high-level programming languages (i.e. not Assembly) are fairly memory-safe and disallow unrestricted pointer access. The C family is the odd one here.
C evolved out of B which was a very thin abstraction over raw assembly. B had a single type: the word. The word could be used as an integer or as pointer. Those two are equivalent when the whole memory is viewed as a single contiguous array. C kept this rather flexible approach and continued to support inherently unsafe pointer arithmetic. The whole type system of C is more of an afterthought. This flexibility to memory access made C very suitable for its primary purpose: prototyping the Unix operating system. Of course Unix and C turned out to be quite popular, so that C is also used in applications where this low-level approach to memory is not really needed.
If we look at the programming languages that came before C (e.g. Fortran, Algol dialects incl. Pascal, Cobol, Lisp, …) some of those do support C-like pointers. Notably, the null pointer concept was invented for Algol W in 1965. But none of those languages tried to be a C-like, efficient low-abstraction systems language: Fortran was meant for scientific computing, Algol developed some quite advanced concepts, Lisp was more of a research project than an industry-grade language, and Cobol was focussed on business applications. 
Garbage collection existed since the late 50s, i.e. well before C (early 70s). GC requires memory safety to work properly. Languages before and after C used GC as a normal feature. Of course that makes a language much more complicated and possibly slower, which was especially noticeable in the time of mainframes. GC languages tended to be research-oriented (e.g. Lisp, Simula, ML) and/or require powerful workstations (e.g. Smalltalk).
With smaller, more powerful computers computing in general and GC languages specifically did become more popular. For non-real time applications (and sometimes even then) GC is now the preferred approach. But GC algorithms have also been the subject of intense research. As an alternative, better memory safety without GC has also been developed further, especially in

    const CodeStuff::VersionStuff::Version getVersion() const {return version_;}

#define CHILD_VERSION {1, 0, 0, 25}

class Child : public Base
{
public:
    Child() : Base(CodeStuff::VersionStuff::Version{std::vector<CodeStuff::VersionStuff::VersionType>{CHILD_VERSION}}) {}
};

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {

    Child myChild();
}

And my issue is that while I like have an easy way to see the Version as in #define CHILD_VERSION {1, 0, 0, 25}, the constructor call is incredibly ugly:
 Child() : Base(CodeStuff::VersionStuff::Version{std::vector<CodeStuff::VersionStuff::VersionType>{CHILD_VERSION}}) {}

I would like to do this:
Child() : Base(CHILD_VERSION) {}

But in XCode this results in an error of "No Matching Constructor for initialization of type Base". Because this is valid syntax:
std::vector<uint16_t> v({1, 0 ,0 ,25}); 

I'm unsure why the short Base(CHILD_VERSION) doesn't work in c++11.
How can I shorten this?

A:

I dealt with something very like this recently, and rather than passing around a vector, I used std::initializater_list as my route to simple constant version numbers.  Here is an example:
class Version {
  std::vector<unsigned> version;
 public:
  Version(const std::string & s);
  Version(std::initializer_list<unsigned> list) : version(list) {}
  bool operator== (const Version & other) const {
    return version == other.version;
  }
  bool operator< (const Version & other) const {
    return version < other.version;
  }
};

Here a Version can be created like this:
Version v{1, 0 ,0 ,25};

You can make your base class have a std::initializer_list constructor as well, and pass it on to your version_ object.

Q:

Implementatnion of std::vector::push_back in MSVC

I explore msvc 2013 STL implementation and found this implemantation of std::vector::push_back:
void push_back(const value_type& _Val)
    {   // insert element at end
    if (_Inside(_STD addressof(_Val))) // <-- is this check really necessary?
        {   // push back an element
        size_type _Idx = _STD addressof(_Val) - this->_Myfirst;
        if (this->_Mylast == this->_Myend)
            _Reserve(1);
        this->_Getal().construct(this->_Mylast,
            this->_Myfirst[_Idx]);
        ++this->_Mylast;
        }
    else
        {   // push back a non-element
        if (this->_Mylast == this->_Myend)
            _Reserve(1);
        this->_Getal().construct(this->_Mylast,
            _Val);
        ++this->_Mylast;
        }
    }

And I have a question: is check 

if (_Inside(_STD addressof(_Val)))

really neccessary? This condition checks is _Val belongs to this vector or not. For example this condition is true in cases like:
std::vector<int> v(1);
v.push_back(v[0]);

What the difference between push_back of element of same vector and other values?

A:

I don't know if that extra check is mandated by the standard, but it avoids a subtle bug that can happen if you push into a vector an element of itself.
Suppose you do, as in your example,
std::vector<int> v(1);
v.push_back(v[0]);

in an implementation that doesn't do that check. Now, if the vector's capacity is more than 1, all is fine and good, v[0] is just copy-constructed in the correct position.
But what happens if the vector has to reallocate? In that case, the reference to v[0] that was passed to push_back gets invalidated just after the reallocation, so push_back will try to copy inside the vector

I then call it in the view:
<%= @user_week[0] %>

For some reason this is giving me a user, but not actually the user with the most posts over teh last week. It gives me ["User", 1] and it doesn't change when I post more often. Is my code wrong?
Also, how can I call the user's image from @user_week? It currently returns the name and pin count. 
User column names:
["id", "email", "encrypted_password", "reset_password_token", "reset_password_sent_at", "remember_created_at", "sign_in_count", "current_sign_in_at", "last_sign_in_at", "current_sign_in_ip", "last_sign_in_ip", "created_at", "updated_at", "name", "image_file_name", "image_content_type", "image_file_size", "image_updated_at", "slug", "twitter", "lastfm", "status", "admin"]

Pin column names:
["id", "description", "created_at", "updated_at", "user_id", "image_file_name", "image_content_type", "image_file_size", "image_updated_at", "image_remote_url", "artist", "album", "date", "rank", "video_html", "video", "rating", "year"]

@users = User.joins(:pins).group('users.id').where('pins.created_at >= ?', 1.week.ago.utc).order('count(

Q:

Loading data in Neo4j from csv

I'm uploading iteratively nodes and edges from several csv files, one per node type. Loading nodes works well, but loading edges does not always work. Indeed, some of the nodes have numbers as identifiers - if so, all nodes of that type have numbers - but are loaded as strings, hence creating edges fail. Creating manually an edge adding wrapping the identifier with double quotes works well.
How can I either force LOAD CSV to use numbers for these identifiers while creating nodes, or force LOAD CSV to wrap identifiers with double quotes?

Zsh color inside command substitution

Coloring output of commands in zsh is kind of simple. Consider the following example in zsh prompt:
print -P "%F{cyan}$(date +'%H:%M:%S')$reset"
You get cyan HH:MM:SS as expected. It works in prompt as expected as well. Now suppose I want to color minutes and seconds in a different color. I didn't manage to achieve it using %F{color}, is it possible?
I can make it work using ANSI codes, but even then it works with print and does not work when used as prompt in ~/.zshrc:
print -P "%F{cyan}$(date +'%H:\e[38;5;82m%M:%S')" - works in zsh
RPS1="%F{cyan}$(date +'%H:\e[38;5;82m%M:%S')" as a right prompt gives 17:\e[38;5;82m14:11
What am I missing? How do I escape the color code or even better use zsh %F{color} construct?

A:

It would have some quoting problems.
It could not been used double quoets; the $(date...) part would be expanded, RPS1 would not be updated for each prompts.
It could be unescaped any escape(\e)s. (especially \e[38;5;82m part for date command)
So, for PS-like strings, it would be useful to quote using $'...' forms like this:
setopt promptsubst
RPS1=$'%F{cyan}$(date +"%H:%%{\e[38;5;82m%%}%M:%S")%{\e[0m%}'

If you can find the color index for \e[38;5;82m:
RPS1=$'%F{cyan}$(date +"%H:%%{%%F{82}%%}%M:%S")%{\e[0m%}'

It could be found by some tools like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors

Note: \e[38;5;82m and \e[0m are surrounded with %{...%}.

Script is slicing and showing the text correctly.Since i am using this script to slice the text by 250 character and placing a more and less option,if any sentence entered in paragraph,now it is not shown as paragraph.Instead of displaying as paragraph,it is showing continuously with out any indentation. I need to show the text in paragraph,if user entered as paragraph even with more or less option using my script.
I think their is a problem in script,not able to find it,need help to solve this.

A:

The problem is that you are using .text() to read the string you want to work with. Since .text() only delivers the plain text without any markup, you are losing the <br> elements that nl2br generates.
The first, most obvious solution would be: Why aren't you splitting the text up server-side instead of using JavaScript? That way you could apply nl2br separately to both parts of

Is the ordering of props in JSX important?

If the o object contains a key/value pair of: foo: 'bar' can I depend on these outcomes?:
// foo will be 'bar'
<MyComponent
    foo='should not override'
    {...o}
  />

// foo will be 'overridden'
<MyComponent
    {...o}
    foo='overridden'
  />

In other words, is the ordering of properties while using the spread operator significant?

A:

yes, it is. It works exactly as your example says
You example is translated into:
// foo will be 'bar'
<MyComponent
    {/* ...other 'o' keys/values...*/}
    foo='should not override'
    {/* ...other 'o' keys/values...*/}
    foo='bar'
/>

// foo will be 'overridden'
<MyComponent
    foo='bar'
    {/* ...other 'o' keys/values...*/}
    foo='overridden'
    {/* ...other 'o' keys/values...*/}
/>

And therefore, it overrides always the last one

A:

Yes, ordering does matter. The exact reason is how Babel transpiles the JSX. You can see this in the Babel REPL:
<MyComponent foo="should not override" {...o}>

</MyComponent>

Becomes:
React.createElement(MyComponent, _extends({ foo: "overridden" }, o));

Where _extends is just Object.assign, or if the browser doesn't support it, _extends is functionally the same. Per the MDN documentation:

Properties in the target object will be overwritten by properties in the sources if they have the same key. Later sources' properties will similarly overwrite earlier ones.

(Emphasis is mine). Thus, when Object.assign is used to pass props to the component, the target is { foo: "overridden" } and the source is o. Since foo exists in both the target and the source, foo in the target is overridden. This also applies to:
<MyComponent {...o} foo="overridden">

</MyComponent>

unaffix event for Bootstrap affix?

I want to combine the affix plugin with the bootstrap navbar-fixed-top class. So far I have got it working then when I scroll past the navbar it gets fixed. But when I scroll back up I want it to go back into static state again. I have seen some code I think from older bootstrap versions and a unaffix event. Why is it gone? Can I create one? Or how to accomplish what I am trying here?
navbar_secondary = $( '.navbar-secondary:first' );

navbar_secondary.affix( {
    offset: {
        top: function () {
            return (this.top = navbar_secondary.offset().top )
        }
    }
} );

navbar_secondary.on( 'affix.bs.affix', function () { // this is actually the wrong event for this. I want this to fire when its *not* affixed
    console.log('affix');
    navbar_secondary.removeClass( 'navbar-fixed-top' ).addClass( 'navbar-not-fixed' );
} );

navbar_secondary.on( 'affixed.bs.affix', function () {
    console.log('affixed');
    navbar_secondary.removeClass( 'navbar-not-fixed' ).addClass( 'navbar-fixed-top' );
} );

A:

Figured it out myself. This event names are totally confusing. affixed-top.bs.affix is actually the event when it goes back to being not affixed.
navbar_secondary = $( '.navbar-secondary:first' );

navbar_secondary.affix( {
    offset: {
        top: function () {
            return (this.top = navbar_secondary.offset().top )
        }
    }
} );

navbar_secondary.on( 'affixed-top.bs.affix', function () {
    console.log('unaff');
    navbar_secondary.removeClass( 'navbar-fixed-top' ).addClass( 'navbar-not-fixed' );

Q:

Check If sp_send_dbmail Was Successful

I am looking for a way to check if a particular e-mails queued using sp_send_dbmail are eventually successful sent from our Exchange server.  I've looked at the system tables msdb.dbo.sysmail_mailitems and msdb.dbo.sysmail_log.  msdb.dbo.sysmail_log seems to be the more helpful of the two; specifically, its description column.  From the tests I've conducted so far, it seems whenever an error occurs, a message in the following format appears in the description column:

The mail could not be sent to the recipients because of the mail
  server failure. (Sending Mail using Account 3 (2012-11-01T11:28:04).
  Exception Message: Cannot send mails to mail server. (Mailbox
  unavailable. The server response was: 5.7.1 Unable to relay for
  thisemail@email.com). )

This is enclosed with other rows that share the same process_id.  The description for the enclosing records are 

DatabaseMail process is started

and 

DatabaseMail process is shutting down

If an e-mail was successfully sent, the same 2 rows are recorded in the table, except with no enclosed rows between them.
So if I have a successful send, the following appears in the table

and if I have a send failure, the log records this

Are there other instances of how the entries could be logged if a send failed or if a send was successful?  For example, could it be possible that there are 4 rows of entries for a send (2 enclosing stating when it was started and when it shut down, and 2 enclosed stating the e-mail was successfully sent).  I've found no log records that diverged from the pattern listed above, but would like to be sure before I write logic based on this assumption. 

A:

sysmail_faileditems will only get you the list of failed emails. If you need to see a list of successfull emails you need to use sysmail_mailitems.
Use the below query to get details for all emails sent the same date:
SELECT * FROM msdb..sysmail_mailitems WHERE sent_date > DATEADD(DAY, -1,GETDATE())

Q:

MongoDB sorting based on highest value of two fields of same document

I have a collection which has the following fields:
{
    "_id": 1,
    "latestActivity": "2015-12-23 12:30:00",
    "activity": {
        "activity1": "2015-12-23 12:25:00",
        "activity2": "2015-12-23 12:20:00",
        "activity3": "2015-12-23 12:30:00"
    }
}
{
    "_id": 2,
    "latestActivity": "2015-12-23 12:34:00",
    "activity": {
        "activity1": "2015-12-23 12:22:00",
        "activity2": "2015-12-23 12:27:00",
        "activity3": "2015-12-23 12:34:00"
    }
}
{
    "_id": 3,
    "latestActivity": "2015-12-23 12:45:00",

        "activity2": "2015-12-23 12:23:00",
        "activity3": "2015-12-23 12:26:00"
    }
}

The latestActivity contains the latest timestamp of the other three activities.
Now the problem I have ran into is that I need to first compare the second and third activity, get the latest among them and then sort the collection based on that.
So the sorted order will be: 1, 3, 2 because for 1: actvity 1, 3: activity 3, 2:activity 2
Is it possible to do this using some query ?

A:

Not touching the subject of performance the query you are looking for is something like this:
db.collection.aggregate([ {
    $project: {
      "latestActivity":1,
      "activity.count1": 1,
      "activity.activity1": 1,
      "activity.activity2": 1,
      "activity.activity3": 1,
      "activity.sort": {
        $cond: {

Outlook VBA -- Trimming non-printable characters

I am having a real struggle trying to get a string tied down to just what I need in Outlook VBA.  I have tried 100 different things from all over the internet, including here.
I use the following:
CString = LTrim$(RTrim$(Mid(itm.Body, InStr(1, itm.Body, CCMark) + Len(CCMark), _
            InStr(InStr(1, itm.Body, CCMark) + Len(CCMark), itm.Body, CCMark) - (InStr(1, itm.Body, CCMark) + Len(CCMark)))))

CCMark = "C/"
But since the body of the email contains: C/      test     C/, the variable (CString) goes to "      test    ".
I have tried using a second variable with Trim, RTrim, LTrim, Trim$, LTrim$, and RTrim$.  Additionally, I've tried REPLACE with double space and single space.  I have tried the TrimAll function that is popular on the internet that tries to find the different Chr() values as well as vbTab, etc.  None of those seem to replace anything.
String stays the same.
Is this a fixed-length vs. variable-length ("sizable") string issue?  I have not found a way to convert from fixed-length to variable.  Passing through a function has not worked.
Any advice as to how I can come out with "test" as the result?
Thank you very much for your help.

A:

To put it simply: the string handling functions in VBA do in fact work. If your string has space characters (meaning specifically the character with code point 32) at the start or end of the input string then they will be removed.
"Fixed-length" strings exist only if you specifically declare them using special syntax:
Dim eightCharString As String(8)  ' This is a fixed-length string

None of the VBA string functions return fixed length strings. So unless you declared CString as a fixed length string using the above notation, that is not the issue. 
Logically the only possibility is that the characters you think are spaces are not in fact spaces. A highly likely candidate in an email is

A:

Probably the closest thing to what you're asking for is Haskabelle, a tool that comes with the proof assistant Isabelle which can translate Haskell files into Isabelle theories and lets you prove stuff about them. As far as I understand this tool is developed within the HOL - ML - Haskell project and the documentation page contains some information about the theory behind.
I'm not terribly familiar with this project and I don't know very much about what has been done with it. But I know Brian Huffman has been playing around with these things, check out his papers and talks, they should contain relevant stuff.

A:

I'm not sure whether what you ask for is actually what will make you happy. :-)
Model-checking a general purpose language is neigh impossible since models must be domain specific to be practical. Due to Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem, there simply is no method for automatically finding proofs in a sufficiently expressive logic.
This means that you have to write proofs yourself, which raises the question of whether the effort is worth the time spent. Of course, the effort creates something very valuable, namely the assurance that your program is correct. The question is not whether this is a must-have, but whether the time spent is too great a cost. The thing about proofs is that while you may have an "intuitive" understanding that your program is correct, it is often very difficult to formalize this understanding as a proof. The problem with intuitive understanding is that it's highly susceptible to accidental mistakes (typos and other stupid mistakes). This is the basic dilemma of writing correct programs.
So, research about program correctness is all about making it easier to formalize proofs and to check their correctness automatically. The programming is an integral part of the "ease of formalization"; it is very important to write programs in a style that is easy to reason about. Currently, we have the following spectrum:

Imperative language like C, C++, Fortran, Python: Very difficult to formalize anything here. Unit tests and general reasoning are the only way to get at least some assurance. Static typing catches only trivial bugs (which much better than not catching them!).
Purely functional languages like Haskell, ML: Expressive type system helps catch non-trivial bugs and mistakes. Proving correctness by hand is practical for snippets of up to somewhere around 200 lines, I'd say. (I did a proof for my operational package, for instance.)

Q:

Linq-to-XML explicit casting in a generic method

I've looked for a similar question, but the only one that was close didn't help me in the end.
I have an XML file that looks like this:
<Fields>
    <Field name="abc" value="2011-01-01" />
    <Field name="xyz" value="" />
    <Field name="tuv" value="123.456" />
</Fields>

I'm trying to use Linq-to-XML to get the values from these fields.  The values can be of type Decimal, DateTime, String and Int32.  I was able to get the fields one by one using a relatively simple query. For example, I'm getting the 'value' from the field with the name 'abc' using the following:
private DateTime GetValueFromAttribute(IEnumerable<XElement> fields, String attName)
{
    return (from field in fields
           where field.Attribute("name").Value == "abc"
           select (DateTime)field.Attribute("value")).FirstOrDefault()
}

this is placed in a separate function that simply returns this value, and everything works fine (since I know that there is only one element with the name attribute set to 'abc').  however, since I have to do this for decimals and integers and dates, I was wondering if I can make a generic function that works in all cases.  this is where I got stuck.  here's what I have so far:
private T GetValueFromAttribute<T>(IEnumerable<XElement> fields, String attName)
{
    return (from field in fields
            where field.Attribute("name").Value == attName
            select (T)field.Attribute("value").Value).FirstOrDefault();
}

this doesn't compile because it doesn't know how to convert from String to T.  I tried boxing and unboxing (i.e. select (T) (Object) field.Attribute("value").Value but that throws a runtime Specified cast is not valid exception as it's trying to convert the String to a DateTime, for instance.
Is this possible in a generic function? can I put a constraint on the generic function to make it work? or do I have to have separate functions to take advantage of Linq-to-XML

Detect differences between two lists of data.frames

Background/Underlying problem:
I have a data extraction job from a production database that generates a dataset used as reference for further analytics work . Between every build of the dataset
 I want to be able to detect if anything has changed in the dataset. The dataset is stored as a list of dataframes.
Question:
The following code is a simplified version of my dataset
account_1 <- data.frame(id = c(1,2), name=c("Andy", "Ben"))
account_2 <- data.frame(id = c(1,2,3), name=c("Andy", "Ben2","Ceasar"))
bill <- data.frame(id=c(101,102,103), account_id = c(1,2,3), amount=c(100,100,100))

db_1 = list(account=account_1, bill=bill)
db_2 = list(account=account_2, bill=bill)

I want to be able to detect the delta between db_1 and db_2, which is in the account data frame. Pseudo code:
delta(db_1, db_2)

Should return
account
id name
2 Ben2
3 Ceasar

bill
<<NULL>>

The response is read by human, not a machine, so there a no tight formal requirements on the response. 
Other items to consider:

relatively small data sets, no need to bother about memory/speed
I like tidyverse code
If we can have git-style comments around new records (Ceasar) and modified (Ben) that is great 

Edit: 
Data frame comparison can be done by 

anti_joins (thanks Linus) OR 
the response in Compare two data.frames to find the rows in data.frame 1 that are not present in data.frame 2 (thanks Vivek)

BUT what is the best way of looping through the list of data.frames

A:

the base function mapply() with let you iterate through multiple objects (lists or vectors):
mapply(function(x, y) dplyr::anti_join(x, y),
       db_2, db_1) # order matters for the result, since it returns

mpich cluster test error, unable to change wdir

I have built up a mpich2 cluster, and the machinefile is:
pc3@ub3:4   # this will spawn 4 process on ub3
pc1@ub1     # this will spawn 1 process on ub1

when I run the test process, it should print:

Hello from processor 2 of 8
Hello from processor 3 of 8

Q:

Css and JS files doesn't minify and concatenate when use gulp-jade and gulp-useref

I'm new with gulp and I'm trying to concatenate and minify my JS and CSS files. I'm using Jade. 
gulpfile.js
gulp.task('jade2html', function() {
  return gulp.src('app/*.jade')
    .pipe(jade({pretty: true}))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'));
})

gulp.task('useref', function() {
  return gulp.src('app/*.jade')
    .pipe(useref())
    .pipe(gulpIf('*.js', uglify()))
    .pipe(gulpIf('*.css', cssnano()))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'))
})

index.jade
// build:css css/style.min.css
link(rel='stylesheet', href='/css/style.css')
link(rel='stylesheet', href='/css/print.css')
// endbuild

// build:js js/main.min.js
script(src='js/lib/a-library.js')
script(src='js/lib/another-lib.js')
script(src='js/main.js')
// endbuild

When I run my task useref and then I check my main.min.js or style.min.css the files are empty. So, I'm missing some step? 
(When I don't use Jade and use just HTML everything works well).

A:

You're piping Jade templates into useref(). However gulp-useref has no clue how to parse Jade. It only knows HTML.
That means you need to compile your Jade templates to HTML before you pipe them to useref(). Doing it in a separate task jade2html like you're trying to doesn't really work (at least not the way you're doing it). Besides you only really need one task to begin with:
gulp.task('useref', function() {
  return gulp.src('app/*.jade')
   .pipe(jade({pretty: true}))
   .pipe(use

gives you the same result as declaring x = [] and appending two the results of two expressions.
That would make the list comprehension
[
    [i + 1, list(word)[i]]
    for i in range(len(list(word)))
]

Next, you don't need to call list(word) to get the length of a string or to address individual characters. Strings are already sequences, so len(word) and word[i] also work:
[
    [i + 1, word[i]]
    for i in range(len(word))
]

Next, if you used the enumerate() function, you can generate both a running index to replace the range() loop, and get access to the individual characters of word without having to index; you can start the running index at 1 with a second argument to enumerate() (the default is to start at 0):
[[i, char] for i, char in enumerate(word, 1)]

If you don't have to have a list for each pair, just use enumerate(word, 1) directly in loops and get tuples:
list(enumerate(word, 1))

Demo:
>>> word = "in_str"
>>> list(enumerate(word, 1))
[(1, 'i'), (2, 'n'), (3, '_'), (4, 's'), (5, 't'), (6, 'r')]
>>> [[i, char] for i, char in enumerate(word, 1)]
[[1, 'i'], [2, 'n'], [3, '_'], [4, 's'], [5, 't'], [6, 'r']]

A:

Please try this line:
[(i + 1, l) for i, l in enumerate(word)]

Or with lists: 
[[i + 1, l] for i, l in enumerate(word)]

or a version from the comments (by @tobias_k): 
list(enumerate(word, start=1))

A:

You have a varitey options with this one, and more that arent listed
l = [[idx, item] for idx, item in enumerate(word, 1)]

l = list(map(list, enumerate(word, 1)))

l =

On a blog I'm coding the admin can edit existing posts.
I want to let an error-message appear when the $_POST['title'] for e.g is empty(There will be displayed:"Your post should have a title"). I also do it if the subheading, content or category are empty.
The errors work just fine if one or some of them is/are empty. As soon I load the page to edit a post every error is displayed from the beginning.
How do I make them only appear when one or some $_POST's are empty after the <input type="submit .../> is clicked (they shouldn't be there when the site has loaded)?
This is the function in the PostsAdminController.php that checks the $_POST's and renders the site:
public function edit()
{
  $error = "";
  $id = $_GET['id'];
  $entry = $this->postsRepository->find($id);
  $categoryFId = $this->categoryRepository->getOneCatFromId($entry->c_Id);
  $savedSuccess = false;
  $abort = false;

  if ($this->loginService->check()) {
    if (!empty($_POST['title'])) {
      $entry->title = $_POST['title'];
    } else {
      $error .= "Your post should have a title.";
      $abort = true;
    }
    if (!empty($_POST['subheading'])) {
      $entry->subheading = $_POST['subheading'];
    } else {
      $error .= "A good subheading is nothing you should just leave out.";
      $abort = true;
    }
    if (!empty($_POST['content'])) {
      $entry->content = $_POST['content'];
    } else {
      $error .= "Your post should have content, you know, it wouldn't be a 'post' then.";
      $abort = true;
    }
    if (!empty($_POST['category'])) {
      $entry->c_Id = $_POST['category'];
    }
    if ($abort == false){
      $this->postsRepository->update($entry);
      $savedSuccess = true;
    }

  } else {
    $error = "You have no permission to do this, how the hell did

I know there has to be a way to do this, but I'm at a loss. Thanks for any help you've got!
EDIT: At request, I've attached a dput() of tstat. Not a big data frame.
    structure(list(VarNames = structure(c(4L, 1L, 3L, 2L, 5L, 6L, 
    4L, 1L, 3L, 2L, 5L, 6L), .Label = c("Dry Deposition", "MEGAN Acetone", 
    "MEGAN Terpenes", "Monoterpene Yield", "Ocean", "Photolysis"), class = "factor"), 
    Mu = c(2703.09, 8066.01, 6566.6, 19741.7, 5809.6, 14231.8, 1493.56, 3067.54, 3631.32, 9951.06, 8748.95, 7967.93),

    .Names = c("VarNames", "Mu", "Sigma", "Hemisphere"),

A:

You can use scale_fill_manual: 
tstat <- structure(list(VarNames = structure(c(4L, 1L, 3L, 2L, 5L, 6L, 
    4L, 1L, 3L, 2L, 5L, 6L), .Label = c("Dry Deposition", "MEGAN Acetone", 
    "MEGAN Terpenes", "Monoterpene Yield", "Ocean", "Photolysis"), class = "factor"), 
    Mu = c(2703.
