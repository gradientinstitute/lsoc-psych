This conflicts with what I think I know about the occurrence of diamonds. For
the most part diamonds are formed just below the surface in melts rich in
dissolved carbon dioxide. These materials rise through the crust through very
narrow pipes and explode when the carbon dioxide comes out of solution at the
surface.

These explosions form the bell shaped bodies that are mined for diamonds.
Because of the phase behavior of carbon dioxide rich melts, and because the
diamond grade just below the bell is very low, diamonds seem to be formed in
the high pressure streams of carbon dioxide released when the temperature

======
gervu
Workers hanging is a thing that happens everywhere. (You might not have enough
resources if it's happening often, though.)

You should design the workers so that what needs to happen still happens in
the event of expected failures, or so that it at least fails gracefully and
with a useful paper trail. Failures happen, good engineering anticipates and
plans around them.

For example, you could schedule up to three attempts spaced at least five
minutes apart, set a timeout on jobs so they don't stay open indefinitely
(appearing to hang), have jobs that still fail get routed to a dead queue, and
make sure worker code behaves appropriately in response to internal errors and
improper input data (such as getting an HTTP error or unexpected MIME type)
while logging any unexpected states for later review. Most of the point of a
library like Celery is that it makes common strategies like these easier to
implement.

You mentioned in a reply that the jobs are requests to external websites. The
rate of errors from that is going to be like a thousand times all other
sources of jobs not completing as expected unless something is hella weird
with your setup.

1.5.0 is basically broken for computer vision. Input tensors are usually in
NHWC memory format, but PyTorch (and CUDA) prefers NCHW (planar). So you'd
normally run permute() to move things around. But
[https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/37142](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/37142)
(and possibly other bugs) kinda gets in the way of that. I had to roll back,
since training got way slower than it was before, and it wasn't super fast to
begin with, even on my quad-GPU workstation.

The fact that such obvious, severe bugs make it through the release process
likely means that there isn't really much of a release process. And what's in
place doesn't even test the release on totally bread-and-butter models like
resnet50.

~~~
smhx
PyTorch maintainer here: we're looking into that and if needed will issue
1.5.1 asap. It didn't show up in release testing, which among other things
does end-to-end imagenet runs with ResNet50 and a few other models (i.e. time
and memory didn't regress). Will also figure out how to catch this early.

Munch On Me (YC S11) Is A Groupon For Food, Done Right - jwang815

Interesting, but I wonder how merchants will put up with strong, Groupon-like
demand for a single item. Also, this stood out for me:

 _"Banking on the fact that restaurants can’t take stellar pictures of their
own food (food pics are a big deal), it sends out a professional photographer
to get the job done."_

Professional food photographers can make Wendys look delicious -- what happens
when I pay for a delicious looking Kung Pao chicken on the web, and the
restaurant delivers a more "everyday" experience, possibly made worse by the
increased strain of preparing the same dish over and over again? I'd tend to
feel a little ripped off by the site that sold me the deal, not necessarily
the restaurant.

maxwell
In restaurants, top sellers, specials, and comps usually go out the best,
unless it's the last one in stock, or they're in the shit and they're rushing
them out a la minute. The random dish that sells 3 times a week has more of a
tendency to come out subpar. Places will probably weigh the marketing of these
deals, and, if anything, they'll out better than an everyday item.

~~~
Gunther
Agreed, also the ingredients used for the top sellers should be fresher since
they are being consumed at a greater pace. This reminds me of how Krispy Kreme
has one item that they are known for, the glazed donut, which brings in
customers who they are able to sell milk, coffee, and other assorted donuts.

Glad to see some HTML5 game dev articles up. Since this thread is bound to

Lime.js to be severely lacking in tools to create something like a platforming
game (I'd really rather not write physics and collision code).

In LimeJS you can use the Box2D library to simulate physics, you don't have to
write it yourself.

For collision detection is pretty easy, as the Closure Library (which LimeJS
is built around) comes with "bounding box" support to perform this very
easily.

Construct 2 uses Box2d and Easel.js I believe.. I've seen a number of html5

Speaking to your question asked in the now dead submission about the ligature
(or whatever) - these are facts, and they are facts that are unknown to the
vast majority of people. It may be that you are discovering them, and you find
them interesting, and you wish to share them with the HN community.

However, it's not clear that they are "deeply interesting." It's not clear
they they contain material to make one think, to make one re-think. It's not
clear that they are specifically of interest to the intellect of hackers, as
opposed to the intellect and interests of intelligent people, not limited to
hackers.

I'm guilty of this, and frequently have to re-consider submitting items,
because while they are of interest to me, they are not of _deep_ interest (to
my understanding and interpretation of the term). Perhaps I don't refrain as
often as I should.

I have not flagged you here, I think I did flag one of the other submissions,
I can't say for sure, but I thought I would give my viewpoint on why some
people may feel these are inappropriate to HN.

I don't have any special status, I'm just providing a viewpoint, perhaps for
discussion, perhaps for disagreement, perhaps to be ignored.

shawndumas
Now that was a helpful answer. But what do you make of the 14 up-votes though?

~~~
ColinWright
Just as you thought it was an interesting fact in its own right, I have no
doubt that among the extremely large HN audience, so did others. Many will
have thought "That's interesting!" and up-voted it.

And that's the behavior that is now emerging (or indeed, possibly has always
been the case) that people up- or down-vote simply on preferences, rather than
on whether something is "deeply interesting." This isn't a criticism, HN is
what it is, and that is my personal observation. As I've discovered in a
recent email exchange, not everyone agrees with me.

So personally, I found it an interesting fact, and it led to some interesting
reading on related facts. But I didn't

I'm a fan and contributor to Lucy, which is mentioned briefly in the header:
<http://incubator.apache.org/lucy/>

While Lucy did start out as a C port of Lucene (hence the name), it's since
broken any attempts at Lucene compatibility. Instead, it's aiming to be a fast
and flexible standalone C core with bindings to higher level languages. Since
it's growing out of Kinosearch, it's best developed bindings are in Perl, but
support for all the usual suspects (Python, Ruby, etc.) is planned.

Technically, the main difference from Lucene is that it gets cozier with the
machine: the OS is our VM. It's mostly mmap() IO, and we're very conscious of
paging and cache issues. While we're trying to maintain 32-bit back
compatibility, we take full advantage of 64-bit solutions when they offer
themselves. The scripted bindings are also very cool --- you can do things
like make callbacks to scoring methods in your script language to truly
customize your results.

If for some reason you're not finding what you need in Lucene and Solr, check
it out. We just became a full Apache incubator project, and are eager to get
more developers involved. You'll find clean C code, decent documentation, and

Perhaps, like Nokia pureview did - however that phone is slightly larger than
the average smartphone.

>Is there some new physics that obviates the need for a large sensor?

No, but technology will advance so that small sensors will be sufficiently
good to 99% of consumers. There's progress in sensor technology ever year.
There's also progress on the processor side, which has been/is apparently a

Why mothball nuke plants when they are not in danger from tsunamis seeing as

~~~
claudius
> Was there a public outcry after Fukushima?

Yes. Originally, the social-democrat/green government of 1998-2005 planned to
shut down all nuke plants until 2020 or so, but the conservative/liberal
democrats government that took over in 2009 stopped that, mostly against the
will of the public. After Fukushima, there was such a huge backslash that our
dear chancellor decided it might help her popularity more if she changed her
mind.

And while tsunamis are rather rare in Stuttgart, the upper rhine rift is an
active earthquake zone, and since we unfortunately are not allowed to just
sell the waste to Russia to dump in Siberia, we also have to dispose of it
somewhere in Germany. If you look at a population-density map, you will find
few places with few enough people to accept highly radioactive nuclear waste.

You are right, however, that it is economically somewhat senseless to shut
down the nuke plants basically shortly after the subsidies/initial costs paid
off, but, well.

>There's a hatred of mathematics in mainstream American culture that runs
very, very deep

Completely agreed. As an immigrant, I can say it is very much a US thing.
Haven't seen this much math-hate, but more importantly, math-utilitarianism,
as in the US. In Asian countries & in Europe ( UK, France especially), people
don't constantly fixate on stupid questions like "what is it good for ? ",
which is ultimately a proxy for "how do I make money with this thing ?". But
when I taught math here in the US as a graduate student TA, the majority of
questions focussed on this single metric - usefulness.

So math texts here are forced to invent bogus problems like "You want to house
pigs with 500 feet of fencing. What dimensions of your rectangular pen will
house the most hogs ?". Then the American kid says, Ah! Now I see the point of
all this! Let l be the length of my pen and b its breadth. You want me to
maximize the area of my pen l _b subject to 2l+2b=500 so I can house the most
pigs! Ok so I see that b = 250-l, so l_ b is 250l - l^2, so I take its
derivative & equate to zero & l=125, b=125, and that's the biggest pen that
can house the most pigs. Very nice!

In other countries, you simple wouldn't come up with all these sort of bogus
utilitarian problems in animal husbandry. Students here learn exponentials &
Taylor expansion as part of "how do I compute compound interest on my bank
account", because that's supposedly the only legitimate use of e^x !

I honestly found teaching pre-calc, calc-1 & calc-2 a complete travesty,
because the theorems & the entire courseware was essentially perverted - it
was all in service of how to make use of the math for some bogus application,
rather than learn it for its own good. The worst was when I had to teach how
the horizontal range of parabolic trajectories varied - the textbook had
examples of the US bombing Japan, & the students went to work computing the
best possible angle for firing the missile, so that it would fly across in

A truly large refactoring is one that you want to try long before getting
everything to compile.

"Hmm, I have 75 operations involving data structure A. I want it to be B.
Let's try it with five operations; I know that such and such features of the
program only use those. Let's build the inconsistent program and try it out
with with the B structure to the extent that it is possible."

The dynamic world lets us have inconsistent code that partially works, rather
than forcing us to follow up on all the places reached by the ripple effect of
a change. Maybe the change turns out to be a bad idea in the end; then it was
a waste of effort.

Psychologically, having to deal with a big ripple effect is discouraging; it
creates an "activation potential barrier" which opposes change.

tikhonj
This is why Haskell recently got a flag to turn type errors into warnings: now
you came make a change, get a bunch of type errors (as warnings!) and fix them
one at a time, loading and testing each part as you change it. You don't have
to update everything to play around with your module.

This isn't dynamic typing though: if you tried to use an expression that did
not typecheck, you will get a runtime value immediately. It's the moral
equivalent of automatically replacing the broken expression with an
`undefined` exception.

The best is G4FON's Morse Trainer, requires Windows, works on Wine.

Edit: You'll have to navigate to the Morse Trainer link from the main page.

Also, it's the best because it has knobs for all the variables -- speed,
number of characters sent, even options to add QRM (interference) and variable
sending speed (imitating very well someone with an unsteady fist).

As an aside, it's pointless to learn code visually. It's only really useable

What? When I was a kid, it was common for camping flashlights to have pressure

used it, kids communicated with friends in the neighborhood at night.

Maybe three years ago I dove into cheap SDR receivers for a few months,
exploring different SDR devices, different frequency bands, different
decoders, etc.

One really surprising thing was how little morse code was to be found. And
when I did find it, the decoders (like fldigi) were unreliable in decoding.
I'm not sure if it was because of their decoding algorithms or if the senders
simply had too much variance in their timing.

The bit of traffic I did decode was simply exchanges of contact so each could
log a new call sign in their books. I'm not sure what I was expecting to find:
because the bits seemed to be "secret" due to my ignorance of morse code, my

I'd be interested in reading about any potential research in this area, it's
quite a fascinating unsolved problem. Like Bitcoin's solution to the P2P
untrusted consensus problem (Two Generals Problem), I would think that the
solution to ensuring individuality (see the Sybil attack [2]) lies in some
approach that isn't 100% failsafe but probabistically ensures the desired
result is highly likely (see 51% attack).

I think a web of trust [3] is something that could work. Given a system of
nodes with public keys (the most common form of identification in P2P), a
possible approach to estimate the 'individuality' of some identity/key would
be to measure its degree of relationships with other nodes who vouch for its
authenticity, weighted according to the 'individuality' of the other nodes
(something that could be solved with an iterative approach, as in
PageRank/EigenTrust). The idea being that while a malicious node might vouch
for many of its identities, it doesn't have any link to any other node and
thus would be weighted lower.

Turns out this exact approach had been developed in 2011 [5] (just found out
now, wow, see fig.1 on page 3) and also in other research with SybilGuard [4].
I'm not sure of the limitations of these formalised definitions, but it looks
to me like much of P2P research (see PolderCast, a marvellous innovation) --
the possibilities are never realised until someone implements it in software.

gaius
Even if you are correct, all that computation still needs to be done in some
sort of unit. Money is good because it is abstracted from actual stuff. Joules
are actually a bad unit, because how do you value an information product in
terms of the energy of the computation it does? Hmm.

~~~
JulianMorrison
You use the natural units of the activity. Tonnes of ore or raw material.
Hours of factory time. Joules of energy consumption. Production line machinery
MTBF. So on and so forth. It's a lot of data, but nowadays we have tools to
work with a lot of data.

~~~
gaius
No, that won't work. You can say, right now, and people do, "If we spend X
building this thing, we estimate Y boost to the economy". You can't say "if we
use X tonnes of concrete, we expect Y tonnes of Z to be produced" without the
X/Y ratio _being money_. All money is is a way to abstract the worth of
something from what it actually is.

Oh, and you can't pay your workers in concrete either. Or do you propose not
paying them at all and just giving out rations to people living in
barracks...?

JulianMorrison
Money abstracts demand-pull from production and supply. But abstraction is a
complexity management tool you don't need if you can crunch the raw
complexity.

What I'm proposing is a "you want it, you got it" economy, basically, that
starts from a premise of equal allocation of resource control (not resource
use) and allows unused allocations to be reflowed to the use of those with
more ambitious projects, with direct-democratic oversight.

For example, if a hypothetical Elon Musk wants to build rockets (a resource
hog activity) then he'd probably end up having to make a public case he was
capable of it to avoid being vetoed, but case made,

LLVM's IR makes no stability guarantees - it can change from one release to

Rusky
The article makes the argument that existing systems are easier to improve
incrementally, while designing new systems is more work and not guaranteed to
succeed.

The problem is JavaScript-as-bytecode is not especially easy to improve.
Anything you want to add/change that would make it a better bytecode has to be
balanced with the language's use by humans.

The solution to one-VM-to-rule-them-all is not to cram everything into a
higher-level system with lots of assumptions (JavaScript) or to ignore
portability (NaCl, LLVM), but to use a bytecode that's low-level enough to
implement the various assumptions needed by higher layers.

That way both C++ and JavaScript can run at full speed as well as have their
implementations changed (even across websites!) without pushing every change
through the browsers- just like native apps, with the browser providing _only_
cross-platform and security, nothing more.

I think it would be interesting to think about ways in which the core
important benefits or anonymity could be achieved through a non-anonymous
society. Anonymity is becoming fetishized in certain subgroups of western
culture, but I don't think anonymity is the real goal, but what it allows.
This is important, because while it may not be possible to salvage anonymity
in some or all locales in the future, that doesn't _necessarily_ mean we can't
salvage some of its benefits, such as protection from authority. Not that I

_Maybe_ perfect equality could be a substitite for anonymity, but as long as
there are any power balances in the world, good people with minority views

lead to the abuses of anonymity that cause people to oppose it.

kbenson
> I think a better question is how to cure the societal and individual ills

And that as well _might_ only be solved by perfect equality. Actually, looking
at it this way, where each spectrum has a range of positive and negative
consequences, but the constrained side of the spectrum is self perpetuation
and not self correcting, reminds me of freedom of speech itself, where we just
accept the alternative is accepted (in some parts of the world at least) as
the de-facto standard because of this.

Maybe the way to frame anonymity is that anonymity _is_ freedom of speech, and
there isn't truly freedom of speech without it, so we should just accept the
ills that come with it. This is probably a known and accepted strategy and I'm
just slow on the uptake. :/

Naming the first price tends to give up too much information. The other party
now knows what you value it at (at either the highest or lowest price,
depending on the side) and can negotiate you up or down from there. It also

This is _especially_ true if the information is asymmetrical.

Welcome to the indie game.

The first realization is that despite you have 12+ yrs of experience it's only
functioning as a tiny cog in a larger operation whereby most of the work was
out of sight and out of mind for you.

Everything from advertising to marketing to sales to business management to
account management to billing, to project management, to development to
deployment to support now falls on your shoulder.

And guess what, engineering for most businesses are the least expensive line
item.

You probably want to match your last salary, so say you were making $150k/yr
then really you have to find $200k for 2000 billable hours. That's $100/hr.

In terms of contractor rates that's pushing towards the top end of the market
when most devs are hovering around the $25 to $60/hr range.

So really, to make that $100/hr billable rate you will have chase a lot to
deliver that kind of value.

Most small-medium sized business aren't interested in nursing an
engineer/developer/consultant for $16k/mo. They'll only be interested in maybe
a half-day or day rate.

Even then the only value add you can bring to the table is to reduce costs for
them. No one cares about how much effort or work you put in. You're not an
employee to them. You are the consultant. They're purchasing an end product.

You either get real quick at being efficient or you're gonna wash out.

Large sized business would rather hire unless you possess some specialization
they lack or is under market. So you have to punch above your weight class.
Are your skills really worth $200/hr? If so, then you have the means to get
those jobs by offering $100/hr. But, then again, if you were able to get that
type of pay you would have just gotten a job.

To be independent, cashflow management is now the most important thing.
Followed by your sales management. To then lastly your engineering skills.

All in all, it's likely your first 1 to 2 year you'll be making far under
market until you've established a roster of clients.

The inevitability is that you'll have to turn to an agency model and

Swear words which are deliberately offensive or pejorative should generally be
avoided.

But there's no reason why flavoursome language can't be used to get across the
developer's feelings about how fucking awful the shit piece of code they've
just had to kludge something into was, and how much they're looking forward to
clearing it up in a later release.

eccp
Source code is not only about the implementation, but also about the approach
of the developers to express a solution to a problem. If swearing is part of
that expression, it's OK to me, but I agree that unneccesary swearing, and
being offensive to a certain group or demographic should be avoided at all.

Loss of gyros would be far more noticeable at low speeds (less than 20mph)
than high speeds IMO.

jdbernard
While trail and gyroscopic forces both influence steering and stability,
neither are required. It has been shown that a bike can still be self-
balancing even without trail or gyroscopic forces, though positive trail and
gyroscopic forces do make it easier to balance and more stable (see
[http://bicycle.tudelft.nl/stablebicycle/StableBicyclev34Revi...](http://bicycle.tudelft.nl/stablebicycle/StableBicyclev34Revised.pdf)).

ithkuil's comment is the more accurate description of what is going on.

~~~
barrkel
ithkuil is saying the same thing as me, in a different way. I'm talking about
how bikes are self-stable, he is talking about how bikes are stable with
active input. Trail creates a steering feedback system. You need feedback from
lean into the steering in order to create something self-stable, and trail is
the simplest way of doing that.

Counter steering. This thing turns like a motorcycle, it's the only way
(AFAIK) to turn a two lined wheeled vehicle at speed. It's not a Can-Am.

~~~
barrkel
It has a steering wheel. Can you imagine counter-steering with a steering
wheel? Swerving to avoid something on the road? Gyros would greatly reduce
agility if they were not deeply tied into the steering, so I wonder if the
steering isn't a direct mechanical linkage.

~~~
Adirael
Not sure, maybe. I think they'll be trying to target people who likes MCs but
are too afraid to hop in one, so it would make sense to have the counter
steering mechanically done instead of giving you the full control... I also
couldn't find anything about speed and power.

As a non-native speaker, "bike" confuses

Nonetheless, I know that the key desirable features are (1) to ensure that
hub-like nodes have services from all directions arrive and leave at the same
time, so that connecting passengers don't need to wait for long, and (2) that
a future arrival/departure time at a major node is somewhat predictable
without consulting the full timetable.

For trains, it's also a nice feature that trains of opposite directions will
meet somewhere predictable, so track improvements like double-tracking can be
targeted at places where crossings are likely to occur, which can cost less
than double-tracking the entire line.

Integrated clock-face timetables work best when rigid, but it requires the
spacetime of transport geography to fit into a regular pattern. But this can
mean that some improvements that would result in faster service on portions of
the network would put the the network out of sync. Because of this
complication, such incremental improvements may not happen.

For simplicity's sake assume we have two short train lines, one takes one hour

So if you were still wondering if ARM isn't directly lined up in Intel's

For a couple of years now I've noted that one advantage ARM had that seemed

could not do that with an x86 chip. If Intel is willing to allow that it is a

Yep. Fond memories of writing an execution trace disassembler for the i960CA

Less fun was the associated project of getting the GNU assembler and linker to
run under 16-bit DOS. I recall that at the the time the linker consisted of

You might point to dictatorships, but I would point to South and North Koreas.

South Korea was ruled by a brutal dictatorship _for decades_ , in a way not so
different from Egypt today. Yet that did not stop it from developing.

Even North Korea fares a lot better than many third world countries that have
little to no enmities with their neighbors. I suspect the only reason North
Korea sucks is because of the pressures/blockades imposed on it by the US
(mostly for historical reasons).

~~~
mrtron
Does China have have many American style highways? When I visited Beijing and
area - the multilane roads weren't connected with overpasses and ramps like
the American system. This resulted in incredibly slow traffic. Also results in
things like the 100km+ traffic jam they had this summer.

Their subway system in Beijing was very large and well connected but was still
overcrowded to the point of being unusable during rush hour.

Such a large population - must be an engineers dream.

~~~
gbog
I had the same feeling when visiting New-York. Their highways have overpasses.
What you saw in Beijing is probably not highways, it is just the normal
8-lanes roads that squares the city. Traffic is a mess in the city, for sure.
I heard they sell 1000 new cars everyday in Beijing, so it is not an easy task
to dissolve the jam. They have a law forbidding every car one day per week,
based on your plate number, so wealthy people buy two, and less wealthy use
public transport or bike once a week at least.

The problem with PCs is not the existence of cheapo systems like this, but the
absence of machines that compete with the Mac for industrial design and user
experience. It doesn't seem to be possible to buy a PC that isn't butt-ugly
and comes loaded with crapware, regardless of how much you're willing to pay.

My theory is that when Apple builds a computer, they know they're going to
sell millions of a particular model, so it's worth spending the time to build
it properly. PC makers have higher volume, but it's spread across thirty
models with a dozen variants each, updated yearly, so they can't waste time
making any of them particularly good.

I'm not generally a big Disney person but the books on animation theory from
them that I've bought are quite enjoyable.

There is book that the linked-to animation is based on: The Illusion of Life:
Disney Animation by Frank Thomas

Two other Disney animation resources that I've picked up over the years
include:

* The 2 volumes of Drawn to Life: 20 Golden Years of Disney Master Classes by Walt Stanchfield

* Walt Disney Animation Studios: The Archive Series in 4 volumes: Story (about storyboards not writing), Animation, Design, and Layout & Background

I haven't seen the flip books they released recently for each of Disney's
"Nine Old Men" but it sounds interesting.

~~~
GuiA
I own all of the books mentioned above, as well as the flipbooks. They're
really great, but you have to have a certain appreciation of animation
beforehand to enjoy the details. It's really just the flipbooks - no
accompanying text or anything. It gives you great insight into how talented
animators animated certain movements, but you have to know what to look out
for.

Not Disney, but the Animator's Survival Kit is also heavily recommended. Also
recommended: Timing for Animation. I also have been meaning to check out
"Elemental Magic" (2 volumes, about animating substances such as water, fire,
etc.), and "Setting the Scene".

strings are the reason I regret not adopting rust back when as a user of a
pre-1.0 language I could have joined in efforts to lobby against this
insanity.

\---

As a sidenote, string_view is so late in coming to the c++ world that it's not
even funny. Having a separate std::string with an "implementation-defined" in-
memory representation in a world of c strings (char *) is inane beyond belief.
(Yes, nulls in strings would still be a problem. But why do your strings have
nulls in the first place? That data should probably be a vector of strings or
a [vector|array] of uint8_t (even if just typedef'd to unsigned char) and C++
strings should have been mandated utf8, contiguous, and null-terminated. You
should be able to compose a zero-copy, read-only, non-owned string from a
character array and decompose automatically to it. And don't get me started on
the fact that C++ doesn't have sprintf because of the obsession with sticking
to the overly verbose and way too complicated streaming operators. Developers
end up using c strings with sprintf to format text and then copy it back to a
std::string just to work around that stupidity.

Anything implemented for &str is automatically implemented for String, because
String implements Deref<Target=str>.

Most useful "String" methods are actually &str methods that you get access to
through that deref trait.

Dereferencing a String doesn't return a raw pointer, I'm not sure where you
got that idea.

~~~
ComputerGuru
Yes, anything implemented for &str is automatically implemented for String...
except some API are stupidly implemented for &string instead. And you can't
pattern match strings properly (think some `for in`) without first explicitly
converting to &str.

Dereferencing a string does not return a raw pointer, that was exaggeration on
my behalf. But a string is a container, so *string returns.... &str? But
string.deref() returns str?

The people who were used to Js couldn't just write everything they would Js as
this article describes, but what they couldn't write seemed to be stuff that
would break a lot of compile time checks. It was a little battle to get one
guy to stop using <any> everywhere, but 9/10 times that he came to me with a
broken script, it was something that satisfying the compiler without <any>
would have found the issue.

And the Java side now looks so much cleaner because we have a compiler that
can check that we're sending it the right types, so there isn't as much work
trying to cast everything from Object to different representations it could
have in Js. I define interfaces that the Java side implements with 'declare'
and get that type checking and autocomplete for exploring the API for free,
which is another huge win.

I've noticed a lot of JVM-Js integration (Kotlin has Js interop iirc) and I
think Typescript is really great there. Flow looked interesting, but it felt
like its approach is more targeted towards existing code bases trying to
migrate to it, and we didn't have that constraint

Polymorphism of JavaScript functions is a bit of a pain point in TypeScript, I
think.

I often got some query methods, that deliver different types of objects, which
share a parent class. Like GameObject, Player, Enemy.

    
    
        const player = getGameObject('playerId')
    

Now player will be typed like the return type of getGameObject. If I now try
to set an attribute, specific to `Player`, it will fail:

    
    
        player.mousePosition = [1, 2] 
        // won't work, because GameObject doesn't have a mousePosition
    

Also, setting the type of player to Player, will fail too:

    
    
       const player : Player = getGameObject('playerId')
       // getGameObject could return an Enemy

Your definition doesn't match how I usually see the term used, so I don't
understand how it's the real one. Sure, it's written into law that way, but
legal jargon doesn't supersede actual widespread usage except in a legal
context. When people say "domain squatting" or "cybersquatting," they mean
speculatively buying and holding a domain with no intention of using it,
hoping to sell it later when it becomes valuable to someone else. (And no,
putting up a generic advertising search page does not qualify as "using" it
for the purposes of this definition.)

> an API developer not wanting to write own/reinvent cache layer for their
> REST API

For Laravel projects at least, a package like spatie/laravel-responsecache
makes it super easy to handle caching for GET API routes. I'm sure there are
similar packers for other frameworks often used in API development.

I really like Bloom, I'd just rather handle it at the application layer, where
I can get the finest level of customization (assuming there's a suitable
package to abstract the most tedious work away).

Seems you could keep the associated code to a minimum, and easily
maintainable, by using model events to trigger cache updates.

Personally, I'd rather have a little more code than a new dependency (and the
resources the Bloom takes from each API worker it's installed on). But in
situations where it's non-trivial or inadvisable to do it at the application
layer, it seems Bloom could be quite useful.

The US lockdown as of April 14 is idiotic for several reasons:

1) Lockdown was started to reduce need for ventilators. Since they don't work
66% - 90% (80% in NY) of the time, that's moot. (But Chinese papers have
published that since January, so I guess we're slow learners.)

2) 98% of people who catch corona virus recover fine on their own. Of the
remaining 2%, most are older, just like the flu every year.

3) The US is not S. Korea - we're not setup for testing or tracing, and won't
be for months. We'll run out of food and most small businesses will be ruined
for no good reason.

4) Corona virus has spread world-wide. There is no way to predict if it will
come back next month or not, so let's get rolling on herd immunity.

My practical suggestions are, to use a medical metaphor, just rip the bandaid
off:

1) Spend a week creating dedicated quarantine hospitals, just like Wuhan did
in Dec./Jan.

2) Tell everybody to sew a mask.

3) End the lockdown after communnicating the above, and let the flu runs its
course, just like every other year in human history.

I understand that it's human nature "to want to do something", but we have no
cure for this.

Wow I really disagree with this. Most websites do have a profit model, or were
never tying to make any to begin with. Correctly said most /popular/ web
businesses don't have one. A large majority of sites are just personal pages
or business giving itself a web presence, most of these pages (outside blogs)
aren't ones we visit daily. Even then some companies always had the revenue
model of advertising, like newspapers and TV they just haven't quite adapted
it to the web. Depending on how much they charge Comedy Central seems like
they might have a good plan for translating TV to the web and be profitable.

I disagree with Speed of the remote too. sure it's fast to flip channels and
radio stations but that's not much different than clicking next on a page as
long as the button doesn't move it's just as fast. I for the life of me can't
figure out how to turn on closed captioning on my tv with the comcast remote.
I know it can be done, but to be honest where ever it is it's not obvious. And
how do I find the channel comedy central is on if I don't know it? I have
browse a channel at a time? this is horrible with a few hundred channels, they
need to make it more scalable like DNS + search engines is (on demand actually
has a decent interface lets make the whole guide alphabetical shall we). On a

have it programmed in to my favorites. Radio's UI would be much simpler if

This is a point about Japanese culture. Presumably this refers to
acknowledging neighbors when they meet each other without any further
interaction. Regardless, I don't know enough about what the author is alluding
to with this, but one can be just as surprised that one's current neighbors
(while living in Japan) actually communicate or acknowledge each other if one
comes from a place where neighbors don't know each other, something quite
common in big cities.

> A typical sentence in India—or from my friend from Mexico—begins, “No, but .

This is a point about Japanese pragmatics. I don't see how this is meant to
reflect silence. A recent BBC article speculates why French say "no" so much

This sounds very much like how business writers observe that Japanese business
err on saying yes, and sometimes after a lot of talking, you can find the no
hiding behind a Japanese yes.

There's more I guess I might speculate on this subject, but I don't see its
connection to silence. The author presents it as an unqualified agreement
"yes, yes, yes, yes". But

It will just have to be something I write myself, I guess.

Use this as a negotiation exercise.

If you do, first things first. Know your best alternative to a negotiated
agreement (BATNA). Try to factor in the opportunity cost, i.e. what else you
can be doing with your time if you do not take the job.

With that in hand, accept any offer higher than the BATNA. Reject any offers
below the BATNA. Either way you are best off.

Of course it is easier said than done ...

if you feel like you deserve a raise, ask for one.

1) the iphones touch screen. I don't care that much about the smoothness of
the scrolling, but I _really_ care about the ability of the touch screen to
accurately track my finger position. While the N1 often is /good enough/,
sometimes it fails badly and recognizes taps miles away from my finger. This
is really bad when trying to type.

2) this might be an issue of my specific device, but sometimes I have a really
bad hissing noise in my headphones. I'm constantly listening to Podcasts and
Audiobooks and I can't live with that. HTC has some knowledgebase entry about
this one and recommends to periodically shut the device down, remove the
battery while holding the power-off button, and then reversing the steps.
This, of course, isn't something I'm willing to live with.

So in the end it's build-quality that kills an otherwise superior phone for
me. Too bad.

I hope Google rev's the hardware and we get a N2 that fixes these issues.
Seing all the trouble with manufacturers not updating the OSes, I'd rather
stay with a "Google Experience" phone as that more or less guarantees updates,
so no Desire or Droid or whatever for me.

One small point, "Google Experience" refers to the OS installed, not who the
device is made by. The Desire and Droid are both Google Experience devices-
Those are the only devices that get access to all the Google API's and apps.

Also, updates being slow are more often than not the fault of the carrier, not
the manufacturer.

I never understood in the first place, why governments let advertising become
such a big business. Yes, there's the informational aspect to it, Farmer Joe
needs to know that there's a new tractor that fulfills his needs, but we're
long past that.

Nowadays advertising mainly tries to sell things that people don't need. They
can't use these like Farmer Joe to produce new value. Instead it harms the
economy when people buy them.

There is of course something to be said about having luxury goods available as
reward for people that do well economically, but it should not be the case
that the poorest families feel like they need to buy overpriced Adidas shoes
to be accepted in society.

It's nowadays central to advertising to build a brand image, to convey a
feeling, to always play the same jingle. Which is psychological warfare, it
carries essentially no informational value.

Free market fundamentalists (I'm not one of them) would tell you that no one
can judge better than the individual themselves what they need or don't need,
and that if an individual says they're willing to part with their money to buy
X, then that's them saying they actually need it.

Even though I don't buy this view because the world is more complicated than
the binary cause-attribution that it implies, I do think it brings up the
question of who decides who needs what. If I believe Axe deodorant will get me
"the hottest babes" and I decide really need it, would you have the government

[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/us/politics/eric-

So we set our local state to what the server says and then step forward by 4
frames to get what we think the current state should be.

    
    
      12    130     no message
      13    134     Frame=6 x=105 dx=5
    

We ignore this message from the server as it's out of order (we've already
received frame 7)

    
    
      14    138     no message
      15    142     Frame=15 x=142 dx=4
    

No need to do any stepping forward from this server state as we are in sync.

One thing to be careful of is that normally it's not just a case of saying
it's 4 frames so I just multiply everything by 4 to get the new positions.
With physics engines and more complete calculations you probably want to step
the world forward frame by frame to get a better simulation of where
everything is.

Hope that all makes sense.

~~~
diericx
This is all really interesting, thank you so much for sharing this with me! I
just have a few questions:

Wouldn't the numbers for the current frame get really huge as the game
progresses?

How would this method of sending the current frame (from the server) and
matching it with the client work if there were a lot of people on the server?
Would the server have to keep track of the current frame of each player?

Why does dx change? Are we not assuming in this example that the character is
moving right at a consistent speed?

I am using TCP, I shouldn't have to worry too much about packets coming in
incorrect orders right? But it's probably still good to implement your method
of dealing with it just in case.

~~~
iamflimflam1
dx is changing in response to the user making inputs.

Imagine you are showing a different players character - at first the server
tells us he is moving to the right by 5 pixels per frame. So we start moving
him, in the absence of any more information we keep moving him, then we get a
message from the server saying 'actually several frames a go the player
decided to move at 4pixels per frame' we have rewind our predictions back to
the when that happened and then replay with the new movement speed.

For the current frame

One small quibble:

------
sjwright
This doesn't make sense. Why would any transaction occur in a foreign
currency? If I use my Australian credit card to purchase a cup of coffee in
the UK, the transaction occurs in pounds, not Australian dollars.

The terminal never sees "foreign currency". It is the responsibility of
Visa/MasterCard to perform currency conversion.

~~~
cmsj
This isn't about the terminal.

Your card, which sees itself as a payer of AUD, gets a request for a
transaction in GBP. This research suggests it will authorize the transaction
even if it is above whatever normal local limit you have on AUD transactions.

Whether that's actually true or not, is unknown at this stage - this was a
test on a UK contactless card, so maybe we have a slightly different
arrangement than your Australian contactless card would.

It's also fairly unlikely that the payment processors would accept a
transaction higher than the contactless cap, just because it's in a foreign
currency.

It's also entirely possible that they don't bother enforcing a limit because
the UK banks involved won't accept _any_ foreign currency contactless
transactions. I've never tried to use my UK contactless cards abroad.

------
lxgr
The research paper seems to grossly oversimplify the matter of "cashing in"
the fraudulent transactions.

While the authors claim to "appreciate that banks will have a number of
security systems in place to prevent fraud", they seem to neglect that those
systems should effectively render the attack impossible:

\- There are limits for CVM-less transactions; not only in the application
running on the chip, but also for terminals. I think that there is one limit
above which a CVM (e.g. PIN or signature) is required, and another limit for
offline authorizations. CVM-less high-vale transactions would not only be
suspicious, but even non-compliant for most card schemes.

\- It is not trivial to apply for a merchant account, and I guess that a new
account would not be allowed to immediately withdraw recently acquired funds.
(If it were that simple, magnetic stripe card skimmers could simply apply for
a merchant account and avoid all the hassle with PIN skimming, finding
vulnerable merchants or ATMs etc.)

Usually every country here has their own online job searching tools. But then
again a good looking Linkedin account, combined with an active github account
where you contribute to open-source projects, always works.

If you will be more explicit about the country you are willing to go, I might
tell you where you should look.

For Poland go for pracuj.pl and have an account on goldenline.pl (Linkedin-

Note that both of these platforms are only available in Polish language.
Google translate usually helps and most of the jobs you might have a chance
are already posted in English. You may consider applying to those jobs posted
in Polish as well. They will consider you as a candidate if you are good. I am
the only non-Polish employee of my current company for example.

For Germany, there are many platforms that I am sure you will be able to find
with a little effort on Google. There are many start-ups in Berlin as well as
enterprise tech companies. Regardless of the size of the company, most of them
are already international environments where all the internal communication
goes in English.

I want to underline that in most countries in Europe, the language of
programming and tech environments is mostly English (documentation, internal
communication, white-board meetings). So just English is enough in most cases.
(I can confidently tell this, because the city that I currently live is
neither a touristic nor a big one where multi-national companies usually have
offices - it's a damn small city with a population of 300k)

Of course being able to speak the native language is beneficial, but not
mandatory. As long as you get

your boss considers it minor, look genuinely puzzled (because you are) and say
"huh, I thought I did a really great job on X, and it was really important.
Did I not do a good job? Was it not important?" Something like that. Again,
you're information gathering, and trying to shift your boss's opinion by
discussing the difference between your impression and your boss's. At this
point, you're not trying to affect the overall summary.

Thank you both for the additional insightful comments.

In my case, we were told the topic of salary adjustments will be discussed (so
I suppose it will be more of a combination performance/salary review). So I
should probably be prepared for a bit of negotiating.

 _Then, a month later, ask to see him. Now you're driving the conversation,
and are much more likely to prevail. Don't worry if this isn't when annual
raises are decided, those are for the "company driven" adjustment to your
income. The "employee driven" ones come at any other time._

The distinction between "company driven" and "employee driven" adjustments is
certainly important. However, given the company's reality, and my
understanding of that reality, I'm not sure it's reasonable to have an
"employee driven" discussion only a month after the "company driven" one. I'll
have to give this more thought in the coming week as I attempt to formulate a
strategy...

You _can_ get every conclusion you want out of QM without any wavefunction
collapses, so there's no need to discuss it (depending on your purpose) and if
you're an MW-er you'd argue that, further, there's no reason to believe that
it even happens. Since there are several self-consistent "piles of words" that
all talk about the same math but contradict each other, (Does the wavefunction
collapse? Does 1600s literature simulate the simulacrum?) not talking about it
seems completely justified.

Would it be fair to say that the second law of thermodynamics is only "a law"
given our human perspective of the direction of time? If time has no "arrow",
but a memory is only possible in non-decreasing entropy which is our
perspective, there can be another perspective in which the big bang is the
future and our future is the past, only we cannot comprehend it because a
memory is not possible in decreasing entropy?

~~~
danharaj
The second law of thermodynamics is about entropy, which is an observer
dependent quantity. It is the discrepancy between what one knows about a
system (e.g. its temperature) and its state (e.g. the position and momentum of
every particle in a classical gas). A being that knows the exact state of a
system does not observe entropy increasing or decreasing. At least
classically.

I don't understand the rest of your question.

~~~
SomeHacker44
Digging deep into my memory of classical mechanics, I think this is along the
right lines. However, I believe (seem to recall) entropy is an actual measure
of the number of ways a system can be ordered in its details and still produce
the same generalized outcome.

A crystalline solid has relatively low entropy because you can be reasonably
sure where each nucleus is, as they are highly ordered. A gas or plasma can
have the nuclei distributed nearly randomly. Both systems can be

A .NET decompiler written in .NET: I bet "let's try it on itself!" was not an
uncommon thought among its users already.

It wasn't this one, but years ago I remember using a decompiler to look
through things like the system libraries and the (relatively few) apps written
in it at the time, and it was quite interesting how much metadata was
available (if it hadn't been obfuscated). I think it's fun and enlightening to
take things apart, see how they work, and modify them, so that aspect of .NET
really appealed to me, but I still prefer native code for its efficiency and

started making clients that would target vulnerabilities in the game as well
as build incompatible game forks that fragmented its user base. Barth, who was

I'm most interested right now in The City of God due to the context/thesis
being relevant today. As a teenager I switched to Buddhism (20 or so years
ago) but have gained new interest in my Catholic upbringing as I was finding
it hard to relate to Buddhism and its history. Culturally it was different
from my own and I always had a feeling of being an outsider/imposter.

Most of HN and others who are in educated professions appear to dismiss
religion though I've come to find it as a guiding principal and cultural
history - Western Civilization is built on Christianity, Catholcism for a
larger portion.

Currently in the US we are losing our sense cultural understanding, in my
opinion, and wish for the government to set laws and regulations on
everything. The freedoms set forth in the first amendment give us the freedom
to guide our lives as we see fit, religion filling the moral and spiritual
need in our lives. The libertarian in me agrees with the freedom but to ensure
others are given the same freedom as long we do no harm to others - nor should
we judge or force our beliefs onto others.

Now I understand that certain groups haven't experienced the same freedoms as
others but is that religions fault? I would say no, and offer the perspective
of culture. Simple cultural norms bring us together. I live in the PNW and
have a beard, I know if I were to back to New Orleans where I'm from a beard
would be viewed differently causing issues with employment. This is a simple
and harmless is example that isn't a non-issue compared to others.

Overall I'm excited to begin the journey with the open mind of an adult.

I'm confused about how precedent works in this kind of case.

Generally, the precedent that a particular court must follow in a case is the
rulings of courts that its ruling in the case can be appealed to. So, a
California district court has to follow 9th Circuit precedent in a copyright
case, because it will be the 9th Circuit appeals court that gets the case on
appeal. The California district court does not have to follow, say, 2nd
Circuit precedent, because the case will not ever reach the 2nd Circuit
appeals court.

For a patent case, the path is a little different. All patent appeals go to
the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) rather then to the Circuit
appeals courts. Thus, a California district court hearing a patent case
follows CAFC precedent, because that's where the case will go on appeal.

The Oracle-Google case is _both_ copyright _and_ patent. Because of the patent
aspect, the appeal from the district court went to the CAFC. Although a
copyright appeal would not go to CAFC on its own, CAFC is allowed to handle it
when it is part of a patent case. Thus, we end up with the CAFC issuing a
copyright ruling.

What I do not understand is which courts have to take the CAFC copyright
ruling as precedent.

Suppose I sue someone over copyright in California, and suppose there are no
patent issues anywhere near the case...it's just a pure copyright case. The
appeal then will go to the 9th Circuit appeals court, not to CAFC, so does the
district court in this case have to follow CAFC's Oracle ruling? Or do they
look strictly to what the 9th Circuit has said?

Given the theoretical basis for precedent, I'd expect that the district court
follows the 9th Circuit.

If that's the case, suppose that the defendant would really prefer to operate
under CAFC copyright precedent rather than 9

If you look at it another way, it's not so bizarre. The person is retrieving
their information from another's head. They're using a social storage
mechanism. This works fine in the classroom, it works OK in the workplace. It
works well in most situations. The only place it breaks down is during
testing.

Because standard testing is only supposed to verify that you're storing the
data locally. Standard testing is designed in a way that only helps "local
storage" people, and alienates these users who get their information from
their environment.

Open-book, open-note, and open-internet testing removes this barrier and
levels the playing field for these "network storage" learners.

Culturally we just feel significantly less guilty about it. Doesn't mean we
aren't aware that it's wrong. Chinese people are fully aware of what's right
and wrong and we choose to deliberately cheat. Whether that's a cultural
tendency or genetic one is another story.

The thing I noticed in the slow new Twitter is that typing a new status seems
to involve continuous autofill-like behavior for each character typed, which
seemed to introduce round-trip lag (or javascript-parsing, or...) and causes
characters to appear at a rate of ~1/second. Unusable.

And this is one way that dominant sites fall: business considerations are
given priority over the user experience. Maybe they just have Flickr-itis and
just can't adapt to leaving well enough alone, but for the time being I'm on
old-Twitter and not contributing much to the Twitterverse until this is sorted
out. If it never winds up being fixed, I've got a head start in living without
them.

There is also a possible Second System Effect amongst Twitter's UX gods. It's

Also, ignores that Fourier optics only holds for the paraxial approximation
(i.e. the small angle approximation). I'd put the rule of thumb somewhere

example, microscopy.

frozenport
>>around a numerical aperture of 0.3

From experience you are being overly conservative. Foremost polarization
effects depend on the rigidity of your surface and the bandwidth of your light
source. The correction is minimal. Most importantly oil immersion 1.4 NA is
common and nobody complains.

Although there is another good point. After making the born approximation you
get this kind of dish shape in the Fourier transform, but on the other hand
the dish is compensated on both sides of the lense

Ah yeah, to be fair it's not a _huge_ correction, but in what I do (single-
mode confocal microscopy) it definitely becomes an issue around NA=0.3 when
trying to characterize spot sizes and collection efficiency functions. Namely,
the overlap integrals can change significantly if your source is also
polarized. Also, I'm probably more sensitive to these things than most since
I'm at the single-photon level usually.

Is a Perfect Storm Forming For Distributed Social Networking? - edw519

======
anigbrowl
Quite likely, though not for the exact reasons the author thinks. I have this
theory that while some sites trade on content (this one for example), those
that trade on specific functionality tend to be just incubators for technology
that becomes widespread if its any good.

People inside the full-service site enjoy a more structured net experience
that would be difficult to create otherwise, as well as a multiplicity of
special features that are unique. But eventually, the overhead of maintaining
existing features means change takes place slowly within the site compared to
what's taking place outside, and those who relied heavily on it as a portal
eventually discover that the benefits offered by the site are no longer unique
and disperse.

Remember when CompuServe and AOL towered above all other virtual communities?

Yeah the active learning is one reason we made it a downloadable tool. We
couldn't figure out how to make that work well as a SaaS.

That said, there's definitely advantages to the SaaS design too, so I think
the products take different shapes. It's good to see more tools in this space,
and your free usage for open data plan should be really useful for

Could you elaborate on the reasons you didn't go SaaS? Were there other
reasons besides technical configurability and sheer scale of data?

To provide a little context, we're currently building an annotation tool that
will be accessible by clients and seriously considered prodigy. I'm curious to
know what pitfalls we may not be anticipating with that model.

P.S. Your work on SpaCy is nothing short of awesome. Thanks you.

~~~
syllogism
Well, a major consideration is that uploading data to a third party is a huge
barrier. Imagine you want to work on internal messages between your users, or
support tickets, or emails within your company. Because spaCy is open-source,
we already had a lot of users where data privacy was a 100% non-negotiable
requirement. There are already a lot of people doing cloud stuff, so it made a
lot of sense for us to think about self-hosted tools.

We also had a slightly different idea about what makes annotation or data
collection "hard" or painful.

If you start back at a business or product need, you first have to sketch out
how you're going to structure your solution before you can start annotating
the data. For instance, you might need to decide whether to do sentence
classification, or tag spans of text, or recognize structured relations. You
need to figure out how to select which texts to annotate, or which parts.
Maybe your documents are long, and it's efficient to annotate only the start
of the document. Maybe the information is rare, and a lot of effort should go
into getting the right filtering process before you annotate your text.

These types of considerations are really basic -- they arise on every new
thing you do. You can develop better or worse intuitions, but in the end you
have to

Yep. The trade off is that takes 3 more bytes but it's a great example of the
thinking that went into writing 'tight' code for these processors. You're
doing a loop unroll for speed and taking up more space, depending on what evil
trick you're up to (e.g. hiding code inside a 128 byte unused spot in the
BDOS) one might be better than the other.

This article brought back so many memories!

My first job out of college was writing z80 assembly language at Cromemco.
Later we ported everything to the 68000. We didn't write anything in a higher
level language because it was too slow. In fact the entire CDOS and Cromix OSs
were written by a single person. He originally wrote everything in c - but
when he ran it was so slow. He then rewrote everything directly in z80
assembly language and kept the c code as comments. Raw c code were the only
comments in the code.

I wrote the graphics drivers for screen and printer and a wysiwyg word
processor. There were no floating point processors. All math was in the
registers (as stated in the article. You can still render a lot of graphics by
converting your renderer to additions and multiplication by 2 (register shift
left and right). I was happy to find years later that code that I derived to
render circles and arcs using only 1 bit step and multiplication by 2 was also
derived by someone else and published in graphics books. You live within
limitations when that is your only option.

I learned Z80 through the Sinclair stable but did play around with the 6502

One notable thing here is they are writing a code generator and not actually
programming in assembly. As a result their modules need to be more general
purpose than if directly programming.

Ask HN: Question about MySQL "create if not exists" performance. - NathanKP
After searching Google fairly extensively I haven't been able to find any analysis of the performance of "create if not exists" MySQL statements.<p>I want to ensure that a MySQL table is existent before using it.  The question is whether or not it will be a major performance hit to do a simple "create if not exists" once each time before using  a table which may or may not exist.  Alternately I could query the information_schema manually to see if the table exists and if not I can create it.<p>My gut feeling is that it is more efficient to simply run "create if not exists" before using a table which may or may not exist.  This way I only have one MySQL statement that can simply be executed before using the table.<p>Does anyone else have any thoughts about the comparative benefits or performance issues associated with doing a "create if not exists" on each execution?

duskwuff
This really shouldn't be necessary at all. In a well-designed application, the
table schema should be completely known to the application at all times -- the
existence of a table should never be in doubt. If for some reason this isn't
the case, you'll be much better served by catching "table doesn't exist"
errors when they occur rather than preemptively trying to create tables which
already exist.

~~~
NathanKP
I considered this aspect but I'm using these tables for statistics. Basically
I am giving each user of my website a table for storing statistics about their
site usage. Some users however, never really "complete" the process and don't
really use the website, thus they have no need for statistic tables. So I have
the idea of saving space by creating statistic tables as they are needed.

I'm going to try the "create if not exists" first and if that causes too much
MySQL server load I'll just create the statistic tables at user registration
and save processor usage at the expense of disk usage.

~~~
duskwuff
Don't create tables per user. Seriously, don't. There's a (relatively low)
limit to how many tables MySQL will keep in memory, and once you hit that
limit it isn't very good at keeping the right tables loaded. Instead, redesign
your database schema so that you can put all of your users

Demographics are appealing based on two things: the direct revenue that
advertising to them / selling to them can bring, and the indirect value of how
much they serve to propogate the brand.

Older adults are worthwhile because they've got a lot of discretionary income
once the kids are off at college.

Young hip adults are worthwhile because they increase brand cachet.

I hate to be morbid, but with the meltdown in IRA and 401ks since January,
people over 55 might not be worth nearly as much as a demographic as they once
were.

Facebook probably doesn't care too much about this.

At <http://smartflix.com>, we've done demographic surveys, and our best
customers are older adults - speaking in generalities, the women are retired,
or working part time, and have enough money to buy canvas and oil paints, and
the guys are retired or working part time, and have enough time and money to
work on their cars, learn metalworking, or tinker with their guns.

Because our price point is relatively low (our a la carte rentals are ~$10,
and our subscription plans are << $30/month), we haven't seen much of a
decline in revenue from this demographic.

juliangamble
_it 's easier to work both with monads and parsers in dynamically typed
language_

I'm asking a genuine question. I'm certain other people have had a different
experience to this. Could you expand on what makes it easier? (And would you
deliberately distinguish between 'easy' and 'simple')

~~~
kachayev
Nice question!

It "easy". Cause it takes less characters in your code: you don't need "type
classes" of any form, you don't care about liftings etc. You can start from
2-3 lines of code and see immediate result.

But it's really not that "simple", cause without constant thinking about type
of each expr it becomes very hard to trace long chains of monad operations
very quickly. Plus types are great for verifying that you didn't break
anything inside your "do" block (which is painful in dynamic env).

~~~
jerf
"Cause it takes less characters in your code: you don't need "type classes" of
any form, you don't care about liftings etc. You can start from 2-3 lines of

Considering you linked directly to the roughly-equivalent Haskell, which
contains neither of those things, that's a strange statement.

You will still need to care about liftings if you do monad transformers in a
dynamic language, and if you implement your own monadic value in Clojure you
may not literally type in an "instance" but you're still going to have to
implement it.

You may have attained parity with Haskell's ease-of-parsing, but you certainly
haven't shown it to be "easier". That _is_ saying something, though... few
languages can implement a monadic parser without horrid syntax. (Assuming you
actually have... it's a common problem to think one has implemented something
monadic without actually having done so. [1] But that's just a general
comment, I'm not familiar enough with Clojure to have an opinion.)

However...

The Content ID juggernaut was devised by Google to placate the copyright

the labels to be catered to. That means giving them a portion of the <10%
revenue generated by the works of independent creators, and sometimes shutting
down videos and channels.

that way thanks to rampant copyright infringement, redeemed by Content ID and

Let them know that because you are a freelancer, you have other contracts too,
so that will be a factor in determining how much time it will take to deliver
for them. It's reasonable to say that not having any of the project fee will
mean you need to have more parallel projects to pay the bills, and you might
see if you can get some amount for work delivered so you can scale off other
contracts and dedicate more time to them.

johnjlocke
The advice so far is very sound; I will add this as well. In the future, work
with a contract, and never work without one again. This first thing to do in
future projects is define the scope and make sure that both you and the client
are in agreeance on what will be delivered and when for how much.

For this project, the blame is entirely on yourself. That is not meant to be
harsh. No contract, you were not clear on what you were doing but took the job
and did not set expectations correctly. This is a learning experience -
communicate where you are with the project to the client on a regular basis
from now on.

Another way to look at it is the time spent already is a sunk cost.

Figure out how much time it will take you to finish, and your effective hourly
rate to get the remaining $10k. If it's a reasonable hourly rate, go ahead and
finish. Otherwise, walk away.

Also, that's why it's better to work hourly rather than fixed-price. That way
you avoid arguments when the client increases the scope.

You don't need to always have an airtight contract. What I do is make a limit
on how much I'm willing to risk, and once that limit is reached I stop working
until I get paid.

No, this doesn't have to do with construction costs (which are about linear
with square footage), it's other factors. For example, even if someone wanted
to build a tiny home (i.e. less than 500 square feet), it's illegal in many
places because of minimum square footage requirements. The problem comes from
bad land use planning, not because "dumb" Americans don't understand a larger

No, the #1 reason it's so hard to find an affordable home is that potential

An important question here are whether we're talking about immutable genetic
encoding vs genetic expression (sometimes more controversially known as
"epigenetics"), which is mutable via environmental stimuli, experiences,
beliefs, traumas, cultural influences, etc.

The follow-up question to that is the extent to which one's epigenetic state
at birth is determined during gestation and influenced by the mother's beliefs
and experiences (as well as the father's indirectly via the mother).

This would explain why some correlations are found in twin study results, but
also why those correlations are never close to 100%.

It would also explain the study results that suggest inheritance of patterns
like trauma/anxiety e.g., in descendants of holocaust survivors.

Teaching Business People How To Hack - jevgeni

I work in a team of financial analysts in a large company. My team came to the conclusion, that adhering to enterprise &quot;solutions&quot; for our results is really unproductive. So a lot of stuff we do is now solved by lightweight home-hacked implementations.<p>Being the designated &quot;tech savvy&quot; person, I now have the task to teach people the tech skills required for this. Most of them handle SQL on a daily basis and know a bit of VBA. My goal is to teach them a programming language (probably Python), some lightweight OOP concepts and most importantly the methods and the habits of a good software developer, i.e. version control, writing code for long-term readability, fast iteration development and just general care for their workflow.<p>Could you guys recommend any good resources (i.e. podcasts, articles, whatever), that you, personally, find extraordinarily good? The kind of succinct explanation of the above concepts, that made you personally fall in love with the thing being explained?

>787 Lithium-Ion Battery Containment:

>Before the AIR Safety Review Process was implemented in mid-2015, there were
other examples of FAA management accepting applicant’s positions over the
concerns of FAA technical specialists, the FAA’s aerospace safety engineers.
For example, during initial certification review of the new technology 787
lithium battery system design the certification of the 787, an FAA technical
specialist determined the lack of a fireproof enclosure could result in
catastrophic failure due to uncontrolled fire from the battery. He proposed to
FAA management that the special conditions design of for the airplane system
lithium-ion battery should include a requirement for a steel containment
structure that would be vented overboard. FAA management overruled the
specialist. The specialist worked to modify a new special condition that was
applied to the battery installation so a containment system would be required.
Unfortunately, FAA managers pushed to delegate 95 percent of the certification
to the applicant, including the high risk, new technology, battery
installation. Without FAA safety engineer oversight, the ODA found the design
without an enclosure to be compliant. Sadly, after certification, the airplane
system lithium-ion battery experienced two extremely dangerous fire events and
the FAA mandated the 787 fleet to be grounded. The design changes the FAA
mandated to allow the 787 to fly again included a steel battery containment
box that was vented overboard; as originally proposed by the FAA aerospace
engineer.

Good article and I think you are doing some very interesting research.

My problem with this type of research though is the amount of fear,
uncertainty and doubt (FUD) it generates. Your attacks are viable if certain
very precise conditions are in place i.e.:

[+] device has not been shut down for a period of time(you can probably advice
what that is) [+] the attacker knows and cares enough to try a cold boot
attack and recover keys from the DRAM, and doesn't have any other easier
options available to them to get the data [+] they are able to take the memory
out and store it in ultracool conditions [+] the user has not applied another
level of encryption on top for really sensitive files e.g. PGP file / email
encryption

I mean if I was the US, Chinese, Russian governments or organized crime and
wanted something on someone's laptop I would just kidnap them or hold their
family hostage and ask for the password. Although Truecrypt hidden operating

There is a lot of nonsense in this piece, and a lot of nonsense out of

But the one thing you can't criticize them for is "lack of innovation over the

A few things stick out:

1\. Form factor - it's a big square. That sounds dumb but there are specific
reasons why it's fantastic. Unlike an oblong rectangle, it fits very well in a
pocket; doesn't wobble around. Holding it feels solid... and it makes using
the apps fantastic. I have all the width in the world to view webpages like a

would want to do that on my phone, but suddenly it was easy). I can zoom into
things with my thumbs easily. I _love_ the square shape. It also means the
keyboard is an excellent size.

2\. Keyboard - Wide real-physical-buttons keyboard.... which is also a
touchscreen! It's capacitive touch across the _real_ buttons. I've never seen
this anywhere, and it works phenomenally. This is used for a variety of
reasons, mostly subtle features that make typing wonderful. I can backspace a
word by swiping right-to-left across the keyboard. By swiping down across the
keyboard, I load a large set of symbols that appear over the screen's UI, so
now I have 7 rows of buttons easily accessible whenever I want, which is

This would be really useful for programming, particularly refactoring. Imagine
being able to quickly apply a relatively mechanical refactoring that still
required human judgement (pretty common), and have other programmers do it for
you.

I imagine it would work something like this:

\- Select the files/directories/blocks of code that you want the refactoring
applied to.

\- Describe (in english) what the refactoring work should be, and do an
example on one piece of the code.

\- The work gets split (by file?) and distributed via a mechanical turk-like
interface (extra points if it opens tasks in your favorite editor with syntax
highlighting). As workers submit their work, the code is automatically built
and tests are run (could be a callback to your local development environment,
so you don't have to worry about shipping all your code up to the cloud and
figuring out how to build it there).

Could be pretty awesome, particularly if you could enlist an army of freshman
CS majors, bored programmers, and eager overseas engineers. I wonder if
intellectual property concerns would be too high for people to actually use it
though.

EDIT: If I still worked at Google, this would be a fun project to try
internally as 20% project. There are lots of mechanical refactoring tasks that
need to be done across large portions of the codebase, good build/test
infrastructure to easily verify success/failure for a given task, and lots of
bored/eager engineers that feed off of reward-based systems:)

To put it bluntly: who in their right mind would want to read essays by

wanted to read insightful, thought-provoking, well-researched articles. If
those happened to be written by undergrads, well, that was incidental.

So, my suggestion: rename the Journal as "The New England Journal of

Assume that an optimisation costs $X of programmer time and pays back $Y
dollars.

When your cost of production is very large, $Y > $X. That's what you see for
embedded systems with millions of units shipped and for data-centre computing
with tens of thousands of units installed. The cost of one programmer
optimising is well worth it.

But for the sunny plain of mediocrity in the middle, the cost of extra
hardware ($Y) will be less than the cost of the programmer time $X.

This is really cool, and probably a better solution than quadcopters for many
applications. However, what we would _ideally_ want in the end, would be a

That's kinda stupid garage-scienticism to be honest.

\- TFA does not mention the stability issue. Guess why people and drones fly
tri, quads, etc and not regular helis. Yeah. (a simplification: stand on one
leg. Now stand on 2, and use your 2 hands as well. 4 legs. Stable heh?)

\- Yes single large prop is more efficient than many tiny props. But put many
large props and the difference isn't so big. Let's take a $1000 ultra
efficient quad: www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0SR5bzuFq4 yeah thats 100min of
flight time for something smaller than the Align Trex of the video. And it's
cheaper too.. The trex flies 5 to 10minutes (6S 5000mah). At equivalent
batteries, the trex flies 25min (hint: the trex is not made for efficiency,
it's made for 3D). An average camera-less quad flies 10 to 15min (3S 3000mah).

\- TFA compares a $5000 Align Trex 700 with a bunch of expensive upgrades -
the top of the top - with one very good pilot with decades of training... to a
$200 toy.

\- $200 toys made of wood and plastic flown by random people are actually
pretty good at acro. Why? Because being more stable they're much easier to
fly. Ex:

For a brief period of time, every human with an internet connection had access
to a significant portion of the sum total of previously-preserved human
knowledge. Web 2.5 has pushed us backwards. After several years now of being
unable to easily find relevant results using Google, DDG, etc., I had the

What Iceland is doing is actually developing an energy source.

~~~
Sharlin
Iceland has also been utilizing its geothermal resources for centuries.
Currently circa 22% of their electricity and 87% of the heating and hot water
needs are met using geothermal energy.

accountyaccount
The sulfuric smell in the hot water takes a little getting used to, but it's
pretty amazing that it's naturally heated in most places throughout the
country (though, a bit easier in such a tiny country).

~~~
avar
The sulfuric smell in the hot water has nothing to do with the use of
geothermal power. Most tourists think so because they've only been to or near
the capital area.

Reykjavík artificially adds sulfur to its hot water to reduce the corrosion of
their hot water pipes.

I can't find a source for that in English but there's one in Icelandic, it's
the "Vinnslutæknileg vandamál við vinnslu jarðhita" section.

This seems contrary to most tourism information, and that PDF is pretty much
the only source I can find... interesting. So they intentionally make their
hot water non-potable to prevent corrosion (the bulk of tourism info
recommends not drinking the hot water)?

Seems like Iceland could really use some sort of myth/fact information as they
continue look to grow their tourism.

You should never drink hot tap water from any source unless you boiled it
yourself using cold tap water in a kettle somehow anyway. There's increased
likelyhood of bacteria and trace heavy metals from whatever heating equipment
was used. Totally not worth it.

As a research scientist:

~7 hours (after breaks), of which only 3h are programming.

The rest is organizational stuff like meetings, writing research proposals,
answering emails, making powerpoints, supervise students, etc...

So do you count your work hours as 3 hours or 7? And curious, if you try and
optimise for more 'real work' time? I feel I'm quite hard on myself and
consider it unnatural if I read an article or even browse randomly at work.

~~~
xaedes
A few months ago I had the feeling I get nothing done (programming), because
of all the other stuff I had to do.

That is why I started tracking my time consumption on a half hour base. "If
you want to control something you need to measure it" was my thinking. The
time tracking itself doesn't cost much time. Did it earlier for my private
life for a few months.

The first weeks my average programming time was only 1.5h! I slowly got it up
to 3h now.

But do I count it as 3h or 7h work?

Hm - As a student I sure had more time for programming itself. But I actually
get more work done now. I can much easier pursue multiple projects and
delegate work to students. It is just that I didn't (have to) see all the
organizational stuff that needs to happen beside the programming itself as a
student.

The other 4h I do valuable stuff. Some of it should imho be done by others,
but we are currently a little bit short on staff..^^ It's a nice learning
opportunity though.

So to answer your question: I would count the whole 7 hours.

But honestly all the work-related reading on the web (e.g. hackernews) I do
should count as work time too. Then you can add some 4 hours or so.

I started Googling when I was about nine years old, at the latest. My brother,
who is five years old, has used Google since he was three or four.

My entire life, I have been able to investigate my interests and other bits of
information, with individual independence. If a news story interests me, I
have been wired, by habit and what-have-you, to seek out the info when and
from whom I want it.

A local news program once teased a fluff piece about some record-breaking
octopus. They were hoping it would entice viewers enough to sit through the
commercials and watch it when the program returned. In the past, this would
have been the case.

But instead, because that subject piqued my interest, I went ahead and looked
it up very quickly online. Immediately, through Google News, I had access to
dozens of articles to whet my appetite. I got the jist of the subject, and
then I moved on. All of this before the commercials on TV were over.

When the program returned, they dedicated seconds to the subject, and moved
on. There was a huge difference between what I knew about the subject from
what I learned online, and the very little I would have known if I had only
relied upon the TV news segment. Entire generations are wired to rely on the
latter, the youngest ones are wired to Google.

My parents, who are still rather young--they are both 41--are more likely to
just wait for the news program to return.

These cultural differences blow my mind. They remind me how dynamic culture
is, and how much it has changed even throughout the course of my short life.

I told my five-year-old brother a couple weeks ago, that the internet is not
very old, and there was a long time when people did not have it. It was hard
for him to grasp a time when people did not have Google. I have to admit, I
ask myself that very same question all of the time.

You don't, and probably for a few reasons. An employee is not seen as being as

letting you leave. If a VC with $25m wants to look at the books, the company
will at least think about it.

On top of that, the people with millions of dollars can hire much better
lawyers and such who can truly analyze a company a lot better than your
average employee.

I've subscribed to IPO notifications in E-Trade and they usually invite me to

could not find enough interest. Couple of days ago I received E-Trade email
telling me I can participate in Square's IPO. Putting this together and the
fact that you got the invite as well, I suspect they are having trouble
filling up IPO as there is just not enough interest from high profile
investors. Clear sign to stay away.

> If your passion is dealing crack cocaine, should you do it?

I actually think so, if the passion is indeed that specific. If not, then
perhaps it's a passion for dealing in general, in which case a job as a sales
rep or a startup founder would be the best bet :) (or, perhaps it's a passion
for crack cocaine, in which case whatever, don't let me judge your life
choices).

Also, the article assumes that social impacts must be "good" (which further
begs the question of what "good" means). A crack cocaine dealer can certainly
have a "social impact", even if that impact is "more people addicted to crack
cocaine".

> We found that the most important four factors for being satisfied in your

The first three out of four reasons go hand in hand with passion for one's
work. If I'm passionate about being a crack cocaine dealer, for example, I'm
more likely to find my work meaningful, I'm more likely to form meaningful
relationships with my colleagues (depending on how you define "colleague",
granted), and I'm more likely to be good at my job. Incidentally, observation
#4 tends to also exist for being a crack cocaine dealer; from what I
understand, it pays well and has excellent job security, so long as you can
dodge the fuzz sufficiently well.

> Finally, “follow your passion” encourages the idea that there’s one perfect
> path for you

Only if one believes that one may only have a single passion. I have multiple
passions, like writing programs, watching cartoons of magical technicolor
miniature equines, making fun of hipster ninja rockstar web-scale Wangular.js
Ruby on Fails ThongoDB devops on Hacker News, and - of course - getting people
addicted to crack cocaine (in roughly that order). That would mean at least
four perfect paths for me, maybe more.

Now, if this were a cartoon of magical technicolor miniature equines, where
once you hit puberty a tattoo of some abstract concept gets magically and
permanently tattooed onto your buttocks to visually remind everyone of what
you're now permanently destined to do for the rest of your life, then perhaps
this argument would have some merit

Serious question: what's to salvage from the brain of a terminal brain cancer
child? This strikes me as a very silly way to preserve a human being. If they
really wanted to give their child a "chance" to live a full life, they should
have cryogenized her sooner, no? (It might be illegal, though.)

~~~
listic
Personally, I'm with you on this. Cryonically suspending a person that died
from brain damage or debilitating disease has even more fleeting chance for
success. Unless there's a chance that at the moment of death the conscience is
still there (due to great redundancy in the brain), it might be futile, after
all. This is one issue that I believe all cryonics companies and advocates
prefer to wholly overlook.

I imagine it should be terrifically hard to let go of your child and ' _kill_
' them preemptively, for them to have a hope of later life. Even if the
parents did even consider that option.

As far as I see it, cryopreserving a person that is not legally dead ('
_cryothanasia_ '?) _might_ be possible, but no cryonics company has procedures
in place to arrange for it and I am not aware of anyone that has been
preserved this way. At least, it is necessary to move to a country where
voluntary euthanasia is legal and the associated autopsy is not mandatory, and
you are on your own with this. [1] This is another issue that cryonics
companies and advocates prefer to overlook.

Cryonics is still very niche as it is. People are still very reluctant to
arrange for cryopreservation beforehand, as it is. Cryonics companies have
their hands full with just continuing to operate and convincing people to use
their services. For there to exist people that are _fully rational_ about
their own or their loved ones' death, and think about it more deeply than the
cryonics companies and advocates, is a whole next step entirely: I am unaware
of such people yet.

I'm ready to pay for access to newspapers via electronic means. If I could get
a Kindle DX in the UK I would buy one and use it for magazine and newspaper
subscriptions. I think it's the perfect way to get access to recent material
like this.

I would prefer to continue buying physical books because I like having them
around the house (except for technical books which have a limited shelf life).
That way I can read them again, give them to people, etc. I like the
serendipity of looking at my bookshelf and rediscovering.

But I don't keep newspapers or magazines. If I need access to their archives
I'll pay for it. If I could subscribe for a reasonable fee on a DX that would
be ideal.

At the US prices for magazines and newspapers I can imagine subscribing to
much more content if I had a DX. But the killer publication for me would be
The Economist.

I was then fired.<p>In a perfect would, I would go public. My motivations are as follows:<p>* It&#x27;s cowardly and unsatisfying to be unable to tell the truth of what happened. I am forced to conceal it during interviews and often get explicit questions relating to how it looks on my resume. These are VPs and presidents doing the asking and it&#x27;s hard to blow these people off.<p>* I can provide aid and comfort to others. I have an enormous amount of information to say about the company&#x27;s practices in dealing with whistleblowers, which can help others in similar situations.<p>Other considerations: I am &quot;good&quot;, by which I mean I think you would like me and think I am a good worker. I have alot of stuff going on, for example, I am involved in a major role in a startup.<p>I know the generic reputation and consequences of whistleblowing in general. I have a low opinion of ethics in SV or tech in general.<p>I&#x27;m looking for advice: How would a truthful, sane, likable, and reasonable narrative play out? How would I appear to you and your management? Would you hire me? Would you fund my company?

Hello,<p>Please excuse me for creating this temporary account to place the question, I just wouldn't want to be linked to this question.<p>So, now my question I need advice. In few hours I am meeting with a guy from a hedge fund, he is interested to investing as angel or with the hedge fund, as I had a meeting with him already and he wants in. My question is a bit complex one, as it involves two issues.<p>The first it's an issue with my supposed to be future co-founder. I expected that he'd manage finding the investor or at least setting up meeting with prospectives. Instead I've done that (the 2nd meeting tomorrow with an investor who is really interested) and please note I'm also the technical founder. Also, I had the initial idea and identified the opportunity, although this guy seems to have a talent at presenting others people ideas as his own. Please note he is not technical at all, but I accepted that, assumingly he would do all the business stuff, instead he dissapointed me, as he really didn't do much the last 1.5 months as I was insisting we go full time on this as soon as possible. At this point, I am serious about finding a way to avoid getting involved with guy. The only thing I am attached with him is that he knows big part of the core ideas (I know the execution pitch so please save me from one. I do have a significant code base I am contributing, and with the meaning of core ideas I mean validated ideas).<p>So, with this small bits of information, what would you do HNers concerning with a prospective co-founder he doesn't seem honest and failed your expectations? I even have some e-mails with significant questions he left unanaswered. So, imagine that.<p>So, concering the valuation now. Like I said, I considered my prospective co-founder's significant contribution, in the initial phase, to finding prospective investors as he made believe he would be able to do that in short time. Instead, he delayed me and I am sure he'd delayed me more hadn't I do anything to find an investor myself. So, he gives me the feeling that he is not honest. Therefore, even in a valuation at this level if the investor would take up to 20-30% at a

Sessions are ephemeral – once you close the tab or browser window, the session
is gone (and the viewer will go back to the 'waiting for content' screen).
This is by design – frop is meant for realtime

When you combine the two into one business, that business inevitably increases
profits by reducing the quality of all services that do not lead directly to
their own content.

Make it illegal for content businesses to own infrastructure businesses (and
vice versa) and the need for other market regulations drastically decrease.

Counterpoints:

\- Before the Internet was handed to the masses in the mid 90's, there was
still a lot of creativity. In the past 50 years we have numerous new
styles/genres of music, art, movies and other types of entertainment.

\- Technically oriented, educated people that tend to be outside of popular
social spheres were the ones that tended to understand the Internet the best,
use it, communicate with others of a like mind, and were there in the initial
rush in the 90's. I'll call these "Internet people". This is not most people.
The same people that can't tell the difference between Facebook and the
Internet still won't without zero ratings.

\- Small websites were always hard to discover unless they happened to be in
the right place at the right time or you were an Internet person and spent a
lot of time exploring and looking. Google helped small websites for a while,
but is now tuned to the normal user, not Internet people.

\- Mass manipulation of society through Internet services doesn't need zero
rating, it needs a self-feeding network effect and a site accessible enough to
non-Internet people. Facebook has achieved this and didn't need zero rating to
do it.

\- Non-Internet people with their inability to see the Internet as anything
other than television 2.0 + Facebook is causing ISPs to consider zero rating
as something to capture customers with. Remember when various groups in the
50's and 60's said TV was evil? They were right.

Programming less - bootload

_Your code at its kernel level must have this simplicity. But at the edges,
where you're accommodating the minds of users, inevitably it gets a little
messy._

Absolutely. Your core code is usually targeted to programmers, that is,
(hopefully) formally thinking folks, so you may choose to be as succinct as
possible here. At the same time UI code may become illogical, non-linear mess
only because their users can't think formally. Bookkeeping/accounting software
is a perfect example.

Those developers who prefer working on compilers, libraries or operating
systems are actually those who want to get the most out of programming.
Maximum joy, that is.

------
gills
I agree that simplicity and elegance are key, but in my experience the UI does
not _inevitably_ get messy. The same rules apply, but you have to work at
different levels of abstraction. The central structure and algorithms of a UI
are no longer about the data itself, but about transforming the data (and
transforming the transformer!). There's a special brand of programmer crack
reserved for those who create elegant and flexible UI code.

Well that went from "probably" to clarity pretty quickly. (the rest of the
article doesn't mention the probable claim again; the only possible reference
is an OED quote about "jasm", not about "jazz").

While I'm sure the OED does make a compelling connection between "jazz" and
"jasm", it seems a bit disorganised for the article not to reference this
directly (presuming that's the author's source).

The tone is also so odd: it's as if it was written purely as a rebuttal to
some pub debate that the author had been particularly worked up about, zealous
exclamation-marks throughout.

> full of jasm!’.. ‘Now tell me what “jasm” is.’.._

And "-asm" is such an unusual word ending in English, it makes me wonder how
"jasm" itself came about? (If I didn't know any better, seeing the word for
the first time I'd never guess it was supposed to be English.)

Running a regex on the dictionary, there are only a handful of other words
ending in it -- mostly "sarcasm", "orgasm", "chasm", "spasm", and various
scientific terms ending in "plasm" (e.g. "nucleoplasm").

~~~
id
"enthusiasm" is another one

~~~
Sharlin
Which has an interesting etymology. Also from Greek, but the original root
word is _theos_ , "god", from which is derived _enthous_ , "possessed by god",
and further _enthousiasmos_ , "being possessed by god", or less literally
"being inspired".

A union won't make a company hire you. Whatever power union has, it comes
after signing on the dotted line, so that particular problem would not be
solved by a union.

Unlike police or muni drivers or Detroit auto works, programmers are among the
most frequent job changers.

Other than Hollywood unions (where main benefit, as far as I can tell, is
ensuring that you don't get taken advantage of too much at the low end thanks
to minimum wages etc.) is there any example of a union for a profession where
you change your employer every 2-3 years?

_is there any example of a union for a profession where you change your

I know a few construction workers who essentially work for the union. A
contractor will get a job, and they'll contact the different unions and say
they need people to get it done.

~~~
fludlight
The unions in construction also provide continuous training for their members,
and good training to boot. I've had real estate developers in NYC tell me they
won't do foundation work with non-union labor because it's so important to get
it right the first time.

~~~
Johnny555
Though the drawback is that union workers tend only to want to work with union
workers. So you can't go with the union workers to do your foundation, and use
a non-union contractor to do other work.

An employer I used to work for found this out the hard way when word got out
that they had hired a non-union carpenter to do some custom cabinetry on an
office build out (he was an expert craftsman who was not cheap, so it wasn't
done for cost savings).

Suddenly it got very hard to find workers to finish the electrical and
plumbing work.

Hackers steal card data from Neiman Marcus - panarky
http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/01/hackers-steal-card-data-from-neiman-marcus/

======
nikcub
Notice the pattern to all of these - the hacks are only discovered _after_ the
cards have already been charged and the card companies piece together where
the possible source could have been by looking at common purchases.

That is the state of security at the moment, not only is it easy to hack into
sites, but it is easy to cover you tracks and not be discovered.

Vendors have resorted to trawling the carding forums and buying up dumps to
figure out who has been hacked.

I can't remember the industry ever being so imbalanced towards the black hats.

~~~
magic_haze
Is there any reason why these stores need to store the full magnetic stipe
details of the card in the first place?

~~~
MartinCron
I would expect the credit card companies would require that they _not_ store
the entire card swipe data (or the PIN for that matter).

~~~
magic_haze
That is what I thought as well, but details on the Target hack suggests they
managed to get hold of the cards' entire track data (I'm on my phone so can't
link to the article directly, but it's on the same website as OP's link) I'm
guessing NM has the same data policy.

~~~
ForHackernews
I thought the theory was that the target hack was targeted at POS card-
readers, not recovering numbers after the fact from a database.

~~~
cynwoody
It was.

But in order to pull it off on the scale they did, the bad guys must have
broken into Target's corporate network. Apparently, the level of access they
achieved allowed them to raid the marketing database as well as to hack large
numbers of POS terminals to leak the card swipe data.

The marketing database, BTW, contained name and contact information, but not
credit card details. The bad guys might find it useful for phishing attacks.

All these revelations are timed too perfectly. It is obviously a crypto-

Copyright for sound recordings is pretty complicated in the US. Recordings
from before 1972 were protected by a variety of state level laws, so even
recordings that should be in the public domain, like ones from before 1924,
weren't guaranteed to be so until the 2018 Music Modernization Act[1], and
even so have a 3 year grace period from when that was enacted. It gets even
more confusing for recordings from 1924-1978, when rights holders had to file
for copyright and then file for extensions, AND the law has changed numerous
times for different dates within that range.[2] So no, it's not really fair to
say that 1970's and earlier music is fair game.

My thoughts:

\- Nothing unexpected really. When they did force touch on the Macbooks, we
all knew it'd be coming to the phone and wireless trackpad, too.

\- The lack of force touch on the magic mouse means developers are less
inclined to create any essential force touch functionality into their software
as a substantial number of their users this generation of hardware may just
have the non-force touch mouse only. Not a really big deal (tons of old Macs
without force touch around anyway), but if they'd been able to put force touch
into every magic mouse too then you'd be able to create software that relies
on force touch in a few years.

\- Trackpad feels a tiiiiny bit too large now. Not a big deal, a little
redundant area is somehow comfortable and its for a desktop environment
anyway. But just look at the pinch gestures, the hand in the video is shown
pinching to full stretch and there's still area left to stretch even further.

\- Can still see a lot of people complain about the mouse's ergonomics. At
what price, is it really? We've got plenty of great mice to choose from. The
notion there are fewer moving parts is an interesting design choice, but it's
not exactly important in the way it is for say an internal combustion vs
electric engine where you see differences in wear and tear and such. In my
experience the lifetime of all my mice has been ridiculously. It's certainly a
nice looking design, but a higher elevation fits better in my hand and there
are plenty of mice that offer that, offer wireless, offer swiping gestures and
rechargeable batteries.

Anyway, the tl;dr overal takeaway is that these upgrades make a lot of sense
and I'd be more than happy to upgrade as an existing MM/TP user, but I'm not
enticed to switch if I wasn't a MM1 / TP1 user to begin with.

Question to you all btw, have you seen anyone putting force touch into their
software on a mac? I've literally used it 0 times in the past 6 months mostly
because I don't use safari, but I don't see any developers jump in to provide
any functionality, either yet.

There are two steps in both overload resolution and multimethod dispatch:
discovery of the set of applicable methods, and then the sorting of those
methods by how specific they are to the argument types. Every parameter type
in the winning method needs to be as specific, or more specific, for that
argument type, than every other method's parameter type. The single most
specific method, if any, is chosen. (The OO case of inheritance is just a
special case of specificity.)

There may be no applicable methods, in which case it's a simple error. But the
case of ambiguity is fraught with difficulties, because users generally prefer
their code to do what they mean, and inferring that from what they say - the
methods they declare - can be difficult. Suppose your language supports
implicit conversions of values to supertypes, or to supported interfaces.
Overload resolution forces you to specify a priority here - which method to
prefer in the case where the relevant parameter type is alternately one or the
other - or to produce an error - i.e. telling the customer that they're wrong.
Bring other language features, like user-defined conversions, variant types,
untyped parameters, multiple inheritance, etc., and you can can quickly find
yourself in a mess.

~~~

Clojure actually does support (multiple, open) type hierarchies (with
preferences) for dispatching on type. This example just doesn't use them. Lots

barrkel
Ah, I see. I had thought that a single dispatcher value was required; but I
see that a list of them is acceptable, and Clojure then uses the more regular
means on _that_ , rather the original list of arguments. Then, the point of
the dispatching function - which is what it's called in the Clojure docs - is
rather a classifier function, rather than dispatcher.

There's always the option to delete your FB account. I went nearly 10 months

my FB account at the beginning of this year.

Regular removal of cookies, and LSO cookies, as well as clearing the browser

Then there's the ubiquitous "Connect" buttons which are spammed all across the

now a great number of users have people on their "Friends Lists" who they have

entities being on people's "Friend Lists."

As for FB allegedly tracking me subsequent to my account deletion, could

Ask HN: Single repo vs. repo for each service? - BhavdeepSethi

Recently I’ve been working with having the entire codebase in a single repo way and it’s not really been a good experience. Every time someone modifies code in a separate module, I have to recompile&#x2F;generate sources to fix the compilation errors. Not to mention compiling takes a lot of time as well. Some of the points in favor of the single codebase approach I’ve heard is that you don’t have to worry about versioning. Since everyone has to pull in the same changes, everyone has access to the same thrift sources as well.<p>I’m mostly accustomed to having separate repository for each service. Personally, I think it makes it more manageable. It goes hand in hand with the SOA approach. A bad commit in another service doesn’t affect you.<p>Yet, I’ve seen the single codebase method in bunch of orgs. I believe Google does this as well? I&#x27;m curious to know which one is more common. What are the pros&#x2F;cons that have factored into choosing one over another?
======
w4tson
Devs should never be checking in code that results in a compilation error.
Regardless of whether something needs generating.

Also there’s a difference between an entire companies code in one VCS and a
product with many modules.

I’ve had experience with the latter and can tell you some of the pro’s:

1\. A single version for your product. This helps communications with QA,
clients and managers. And communication is the game we are in whether we like
it or not

2\. Reduced friction in developing features that cut across modules. Lets say
I need to add a column to a database and then expose in the Ui. update the
sql, added the field in a webservice, make the necessary adjustments in the
UI, write the tests all on the same commit.

3\. Increased collaboration. Quite often invisible lines are drawn on
development teams where devs are feel they are unable to modify a module
because they didn’t write it, they don’t understand it or they just feel that
its not a part of their job. With everything in one repo this reduces the
barrier to entry

Its not a free lunch

Ask HN: VC funded startup downsides? - mr_puzzled
I&#x27;m starting to question the whole thought process behind VC funded startups : take money -&gt; grow fast -&gt; get to a liquidity event so investors can make returns. VC funded startups are all about growth growth growth. I feel like there are serious downsides to this mentality :<p>- encourages failing quickly hence is a wasteful process<p>- almost always companies do desperate things to keep growing and changing, hurting users eg- reddit<p>- a steady state i.e zero growth but profitable existence is not encouraged. Such a state of existence is actively discouraged so it becomes : keep growing or die already. A lot of companies that could exist, make a profit and keep users happy instead just die.<p>- It&#x27;s likely you give up some control over the direction of the company having to balance stakeholders, getting to a liquidity event, growing a business.<p>What are your thoughts? Here&#x27;s a crazy idea : YC but for bootstrappers. Give each startup $120k and ask them to pay back 5X that once they become profitable. The most valuable thing about YC is the people, network and fellow founders. I think removing the VC factor should be considered, at least for a parallel program.
======
Eridrus
> Give each startup $120k and ask them to pay back 5X that once they become
> profitable.

The devil is going to be in the details of what "profitable" means. If the
company just keeps hiring people and growing, are they profitable, or not?

You also have to remember that this idea would be competing with bank loans,
so you would have to be willing to take significantly more risk than a bank
does to ask for get 5X returns.

Speaking of which, "5X" returns may sound great, but the timeline for those is
somewhat important too. 5X in 3 years is very different to 5X in 20 years.

Maybe it's just me, but I wouldn't take this deal. I'm not super interested in
VC unicorn money, but as someone in tech, it's really not hard to pull 120k
together. And if I thought it was just going to be "profitable", I wouldn't
want to be in a position where I am being asked to pay back 600

In general, using _n_ -grams[1], probably at the character level. (So, as the
article mentions, the bigram "ch" is common in German, and "qu" is much more
common than "q _X_ " for any _X_ in English)

You can analyse texts you believe to be similar (in language, period, subject,
etc) to the coded message you are attempting to crack, and use that to build
tables of these n-grams in various semantic units.

Of course, these are useful in many more things than code-breaking, and Google
have various datasets they make publically available.

The Google books ngram viewer[2] is a fun tool to play around with, or for the
more serious, you can download a corpus of ~24GB of analysed web data they've

While I agree with your overall message, and even the part I quote, if you
think "holistically" then it is in the US interest to dominate trade
negotiations through intelligence. For example, it's better for US national
security if Brazil had bought a US fighter. It strengthens the financial
health of Boeing, makes it easier for the US to keep up a certain level of
capability (paid for by foreignors, win-win!), has money coming in to the US
for decades as a result of the maintenance contracts, and there's a non-zero
chance that the software for flying those planes have backdoors and loggers.

I'm not saying it's right, but the security forces and corporations are very
much motivated for this to happen, with ready made excuses of national
security to justify it.

Incorrect - NSA surveillance most definitely HAS targeted Americans in
America. That is precisely what the Snowden disclosures show - leaving aside

What kind of bioinformatics software are you plugging into a webapp?

arturhoo
That's a neat way way to tight together both worlds, and I can see it being
useful in cases like testing.

Nonetheless, it is important to distinguish the need to communicate between
programs and the need to programmatically run a piece of software like ffmpeg
and getting its output.

For the seconds case, especially in more complex architectures, where you need
"interact with software written in another language" it makes sense to
explicitly separate this interaction, for example through a broker [0]. In the
end, all you need is a way to communicate from Program A that Program B can do
some sort of job, and this can be a simple string pointing to a raw video file
in a storage like S3, not necessarily the raw file.

"[Tom] saw a new girl in the garden--a lovely little blue-eyed creature with
yellow hair plaited into two long-tails, white summer frock and embroidered
pantalettes." (Tom Sayer, by Mark Twain)

Reading this, we all pictured the girl in our minds. But I believe the exact
image of the girl I have is different from yours. This is our mind working and
filling in the gaps of the information that it believes to be missing. Some
people may see the girl vividly, filling it with details like some freckles
and an embroidered dress while others will simply see a blonde girl with blue
eyes. But our ming WORKED to make that.

In the book Understanding Comics by Scott McCloud, he says that the most
import place in a comic book is the place between the pannel, where our mind
rushes in to fill in the gaps, to connect the action.

Even movies have this. We have the jump cut, that can be considered a jump
from one panel to another (with the implicit "space in between"). We also have
the "places outside the scene". If someone goes away to get a coffee, we can
picture it happening. If the scene is being filmed in a room, and we can only
see 3 of the walls, we KNOW there is a fourth one.

And, besides it all, with every medium we consume, we have the "baggage" we
take with us. Our knowledge of previous stories, movies, songs, books; our own
opinions on the theme and even if we had a good or bad day will influence our
experiencing of the "object" (book, movie, etc.)

It isn't because we're not moving our hands that the medium becomes "passive".

Books are what they are. And they are good at it. The author's fault is that
he is trying to change books while what he should really be doing is creating
a new medium.

Swift 5 Release Notes for Xcode 10.2 beta - Austin_Conlon

Though it is underplayed in the release notes, the biggest initiative with
Swift 5 is the stable ABI.

Now that the binary interface is locked down, the Swift runtime and standard
library can ship as part of an OS. That means that Swift can be used in system
frameworks, the runtime support libraries won't need to be vendored in each
app, and it opens the door to shipping (non-OS) binary frameworks.

How many MBs are the Standard Library for Swift? If it is 10MB then many user

For those of us who struggled with Swift 1 and 2, something else to remember:
the pure Swift reimplementation of Foundation was pretty basic (or non-
existent), so what we used in the early days was basically the ObjC-based NS*
frameworks but in a different language - for the most part.

Nowadays, it's possible to avoid using Foundation for a lot of basic tasks.
This is great news for Linux developers (and eventually Windows developers
when Foundation is mature enough) because a lot of basic tasks that once
relied on ObjC no longer do.

adventured
All of this said without knowing what your actual business does.

Ideally whichever is easiest to calculate use for by the customer (assuming
you can keep your pricing structure similar in terms of what you earn as
well).

If users might be sharing anywhere from 5 to 500 or 5,000 links, that's a
pricing nightmare in which the customer doesn't know their costs and it might
be very hard to estimate ahead of time. That's a non-starter for most
businesses.

When something has such low per unit costs and value as an individual link,
I'd tend to argue in favor of a layer above that which simplifies the pricing:
in this case, the per user pricing model. If you can provide unlimited links
per user in that model, all the better.

will be happy to pay more?

Last I heard, there were less than 10 companies with access to the full
firehouse (which has every tweet). Most only get a partial feed, if that.

Disclaimer: Used to work for Dataminr; was laid off.

~~~
ashtonkem
That’s true, but doesn’t mean quite what you’re implying.

The full firehose was originally given to a small number of companies,
including Gnip (eventually purchased by Twitter). What Gnip did was provide
filtering for the firehose as well as some historical searches; this in theory
would allow companies to receive in soft real time every tweet that was
relevant to their search query.

The result is that there are tons of people who don’t have access to the full
firehose, but effectively have the ability to receive every single tweet
that’s relevant to their search query. It wouldn’t be very hard to find every
tweet relevant to a protest, as this is superficially quite similar to finding
tweets relevant to a brand or marketed event.

That being said, this isn’t a product that you can just sign up for and use.
You had (my contacts no longer work at twitter) to negotiate a contract with
Twitter directly to get access to this, pay large sums of money, and go
through a fairly high touch sales and support process.

You mean Classical Mechanics? Plus your example doesn't make sense because the
term "Newtonian Mechanics" was likely coined only after Relativistic Mechanics
were discovered[0][1], Newton himself referred to it as "Natural Philosophy".
In addition "Newtonian Mechanics" isn't even the preferred name, Wikipedia
refers to it as "Classical Mechanics"[2] while the Webster's definition of
"Newtonian Mechanics"[3] is just the words "Classical Mechanics", which
themselves have a much longer entry[4]. The fact that we do not in fact refer
to "Classical Mechanics" as "Philosophiae Naturalis" actually supports my
point: as our understanding of Physics improved we renamed the field, with
older concepts/terms falling out of use and being renamed when they are
reused.

This includes the iPhone Xs and 11 (and presumably all A12 and A13 devices).
Was there a new exploit found on these chips? Last I checked only devices with
chips older than the A12 were vulnerable to the checkra1n exploit.

publicly. The exploit was paid for by a phone case manufacturer.

I was tired of games like Mafia Wars and wanted a phone-based MMO Strategy game where hundreds of players could actually engage each other on a 2D map, so I made one.<p>I track the state of the game each night so we can display a visual timeline of territory controlled by each alliance. (example: http://bit.ly/q5CFhU)  I use jQuery mobile for the front end so it runs on most phones (via Phonegap) as well as modern web browsers.  The server side is handled by Java Servlets and MySQL.<p>This started as a hobby - I'm not a developer by training - so I am very interested in feedback, suggestions, and ideas for improvements.

This caught my eye because I'm a lurker here on Hacker News who actually plays
this game! I'm super excited you are posting here because I really want to
learn more about your server architecture. Can you provide more info on your
java stack as well as the kind of hardware is running the site? Previous games
had 300+ users, so scalability shouldn't be an issue yet, but have you planned
for that?

Once criticism: For the time I've been playing, the game has been evolving
rather quickly, and new features seem to have taken precedence over client
stability.

~~~
wizzo
We've actually taken a pretty homebrew approach and aren't using any external
frameworks - just Tomcat and MySQL. On the hardware side we're using Linode
shared servers so that we can quickly and easily scale up or down as needed.
The game code is pretty efficient - we've run tests with thousands of players
and had no problems, on modest hardware, so we're looking forward to growing
quickly!

It's true that we've had some stability issues at times, but we're trying to
cover a lot of platforms (Android, iOS, webOS, web) and add a lot of new
features to improve the game. Now that we've officially launched (on 10/1)
stability will definitely our #1 priority, though.

client or server code or documenting the client/server communication so the

Who wants cheaper books? (Help the Domino Project) - cgshaw

I've noticed many HN readers mentioning books of all sorts of varieties.<p>I'm a member of the Domino Project Street Team. Seth Godin along with Amazon is trying to disrupt the publication and book distribution process in a big way.<p>One of the things we're experimenting with now is how to build a list and market to folks in a meaningful way. To get people interested in the project and spreading ideas, Seth is offering to lower the price of his first book, "Poke the Box." For every 5,000 people that sign up for the mailing list, he'll drop the price of the Kindle copy by 1.00. Right now the price is 7.99. He'll go all the way to .99. The Kindle version can be read on nearly any device / computer, but if you want a hardcopy, the book is still at a reasonable 9.99.<p>Just for clarification--I'm not here to sell books. I'm here to spread ideas and come up with ways to get better books in our hands faster and cheaper. If you have no desire to read Seth's book, but want to help us validate (or invalidate) ideas on how to better reach people to keep book prices down, please let us know.<p>This is but one experiment. We've got other ideas and eventually other books will be published through the Domino Project. Please comment in here and ask about the project or contact me, my info is in my profile.<p>You can subscribe to the newsletter at http://bit.ly/h3C0vv .<p>More info on the Domino Project at http://thedominoproject.com

Who wants free books?

I'm a member of the Internet. Web pages have disrupted publishing and text
distribution in a big way.

One of the things we're experimenting with now is how to build links and get
relevant search results. It'll drop the price of all text to $0.00. The text
version can be read on nearly any device, but if you want a hard copy, you can
use a printer.

This is but one experiment. We've got other ideas and eventually text will
lead to images and audio. Please comment anywhere.

which part did you feel was _fantastical_ or _deeply paranoid_?

I'm actually terrified by doing the math with the most conservative, best case
outcome: under that I will

a) be dead,

b) know somebody who has died,

c) many in my surrounding will struggle because of the socio-economic effects
and lack the reserves to deal with the primary effects (emotional) and
secondary effects (emotional and financial)

... also a/b/c are in no way mutually exclusive

\- If you have no breathe/heart chronic problems, and you are under 40 y/o,
your death chance, IN CASE YOU DO HAVE the coronavirus, is below 1%. \- There
will not be a strong economic impact that will stop globalisation. Maybe there
will be economics short term changes. Maybe there will be important. But what
is said here is apocaliptic. You should read about the SRAS (15 times more
deadly, less infectious), or about ebola (40-80 times more deadly, less
infectious).

ebola, SRASS, H1N1, H1Z1, mad cow, all of thoses deases have killed a lot of
peoples. Not in EU nor US. only poor non-white people have died. Everybody is
really afraid by this one only because rich countries will have to do
something, not just watch poor black people die on TV. ebola killed 11k
peoples during 2014-2016.

The only really special thing is that you've between 2 and 14 days, if you
caught coronavirus, during which you are infectious. the dease have strong
contagious capabilities because of that. But that's clearly not the most
dangerous

Two things has greatly reduced it and it resulted in a significant change in
general QOL for me; 1\. bite guard when sleeping. 2\. jaw relaxation exercise
program.

I have a malocclusion however. So ymmv perhaps.

Ask your dentist for a jaw relax program. It's just 5-6 simple exercises you
do with your jaw, (I could upload a copy of my pdf if you'd like).

Something I'm looking into now is myofunctional training/exersices (haven't
tried yet). The "science" on it doesn't seem 100% yet, and mostly promoted by
one company. Thoughts?

Edit: forgot to mention that physiotherapy helped immensely as well. I had
poor posture/forward tilting head, which i believe i feel into due to my
malocclusion. Perhaps be wary of aches/bad alignment/discomfort in neck and
shoulders and see whether physio for that could help alleviate.

with. Some offer even more comfort, etc. that can reduce clenching or soreness
beyond just preventing grinding.

2\. muscle relaxers if your doctor thinks it can help.

3\. reducing stress

4\. improve sleep posture and quality of bedding

5\. establish rigorous sleep habits, like when you stop eating at night, when
you stop using devices, adequate darkness, temperature control

Sorry, but how is PHP at fault? You can shoot yourself in the foot with _ANY_

Natsu
PHP has been known to provide convenient footguns in the past (e.g.
register_globals, mercifully depreciated), so it's not surprising that
security-minded people give it a hard time.

Think of it as the difference between the language keeping loaded footguns
under its pillow with the safety off and keeping unloaded footguns in a locked
gun safe. One is a lot less likely to get used than the other, even if either
one will shoot your foot just as well.

Fast forward to a month later. The tables have turned completely the other
direction. The fourth guy who I hated at first was my favorite student. The
three students I had liked at the beginning now were the ones giving me the
most greif. The extroverted easy to work with likable guys were pleasant to
deal with, but they weren't very smart, and I had a lot of trouble teaching
them stuff. The fourth guy was hard to deal with, but he was extremely smart
and I barely had to teach him anything, he learned everything on his own.

Once the economy got bad, the student/instructor ratio fell. The flight school
hired a bunch more instructors and got less students. Every instructor got 2
students instead of 4. I made it a habit to go around to all the new
instructors and ask them if they have a student they they don't really like
working with. 4 times out of 5 the instructor would tell me "yeah I have this
one guy..." My last 6 months at that job I had 8 students that basically
taught themselves. That was easy money.

I've found the best way to deal with unlikable people is to just let them go
off and do their own thing. The act like that (unconsciously) because they
resent you getting in their way.

~~~
hkmurakami
A friend of mine is like the 4th student you describe: very smart but comes
off as standoffish and cold until he warms up to you. He was actually let go
from a well known (everyone here would know the name) startup in SF/SV wiht a
noted brogammer culture after a few months since he "wasn't a culture fit".
He's now thriving at a place that suits his character much more.

In the end I think both parties "won" by his dismissal, but companies hiring
for culture fit should be aware that they're willingly constraining their
talent pool by doing this. (I don't think it's necessarily wrong either -- I
expect to have some form of latent character filter if I'm in a hiring
position as well. However, I'm much more fond of the introverted, "difficult"
types than the average person).

At a high level, jQuery has two main things going for it:

1) It has awesome functionality. 2) It's indistinguishably close to being
browser-independent

It looks like MS has adopted jQuery for (1), and their developers will get (2)
for free.

Of course, (2) may also have figured into MS's (apparent) decision to adopt.
If that's the case, more power to 'em. Nothing would please me more than

How well does it work to version control Mathematica notebooks in git? For
example, is it possible to get meaningful textual diffs when comparing two
versions of a mathematica notebook, and can git compress them enough to keep
repo size down?

With iPython this is also an issue -- tracking code in JSON is much less clean
than tracking code in text files.

It's interesting that Mathematica and iPython both left code-as-plain-text
behind as a storage format. I wonder if it would have been possible to come up
with a hybrid solution, i.e. retain plain-text code files but with a
serialized data structure (JSON-like, or binary) as the glue.

Papers (and PDFs) are relevant because they are easy to organize and archive,
essentially in perpetuity. Source code is too, so nothing wrong with a "Github
for Science". Notebooks, blogs, or interactive dashboards, on the other hand,
are an amazing tool both for research and for communication, but they are far
more ephemeral than a paper. They need a large overhead to keep them running
that cannot be sustained over decades or centuries. Typically, you'll have
lots of trouble re-running a 5 year old notebook. That's not to say they're
useless, e.g. as supplementary material (quite the opposite). They're just not
going to replace papers anytime soon.

Those are good points. Journals have to care about this, too, these days --

One of the most fascinating things I've read by Stevenson was his description
of his creative process, the success of which he attributed to the "little
people" in his dreams, or what he called his "Brownies".

Referring to himself in the third person, Stevenson writes:

 _" This honest fellow had long been in the custom of setting himself to sleep
with tales, and so had his father before him; but these were irresponsible
inventions, told for the teller's pleasure, with no eye to the crass public or
the thwart reviewer: tales where a thread might be dropped, or one adventure
quitted for another, on fancy's least suggestion. So that the little people
who manage man's internal theatre had not as yet received a very rigorous
training; and played upon their stage like children who should have slipped
into the house and found it empty, rather than like drilled actors performing
a set piece to a huge hall of faces._

 _" But presently my dreamer began to turn his former amusement of story-
telling to (what is called) account; by which I mean that he began to write
and sell his tales. Here was he, and here were the little people who did that
part of his business, in quite new conditions._

 _" The stories must now be trimmed and pared and set upon all fours, they
must run from a beginning to an end and fit (after a manner) with the laws of
life; the pleasure, in one word, had become a business; and that not only for
the dreamer, but for the little people of his theatre. These understood the
change as well as he. When he lay down to prepare himself for sleep,

to Ning and Ning releasing a solution. Furthermore, it appears the Dutch news
sites and TNW's translation are only reporting on the issue because the
students are comfortable in now releasing this information, only after Ning
has patched the vulnerability, BEFORE millions of accounts could be
compromised. In this regard, I don't understand TNW's tone nor this post's

Of course, Ning should certainly come forward with their findings and what

Even the "global warming skeptics" aren't actually skeptical about the fact
that warming has been happening. Rather, they're skeptical that there's a
sudden uptick in the last few decades, and/or that global warming as it exists
is human-caused.

It's well understood that several hundred years ago, it was colder (at least
in the northern hemisphere), simply because of historical records we have that
don't make much sense otherwise. Also, it's well understood (though recently
challenged) that it was warmer than twentieth century levels before that for

Team,

We're cutting our workforce to strengthen Twitter as a company.

The team has been deciding how to best streamline Twitter, Vine, and Periscope
to put their focus on the projects which will have the greatest impact.
Moments, which we launched last week, is a great beginning. It's a peek into
the future of how people will see what's going on in the world.

We plan to cut up to 336 people. This was a tough decision, and we'll offer
each person a generous exit package and help finding a new job. Product and
Engineering are going to make the most changes. Engineering will be smaller
but remain the biggest percentage of the organization, and other departments
will be cut in parallel.

This isn't easy. We'll honor those who we're losing with our service to all
the people who use Twitter. We'll do it with a more purpose-built team. Thank
you all for your trust and understanding here. As always, please reach out to
me directly with any ideas or questions.

That's not really my point. My point's we have no idea what TFA is trying to
do or see[0], so you may be able to say "this is stupid and nonsensical"
because it is[1], but you can't say "I've got a better version" then provide
something with a completely different behaviour.

[0] most likely they just threw some shit at the wall, ended up with
relatively long runtimes and called that a benchmark

[1] or maybe not, maybe it's a reduction of actual workload in the system
doing computation based on some sort of dynamic number of items so you can't
preallocate the intermediate storage and the point's to compare reallocation
overhead[2]

[2] not very likely though, considering you never need the array in the first
place as you're just summing each item with the previous one, then summing
every 100 item of that… anyway

Oh microbenchmarks.

All of this is going to be optimized away by a sufficiently smart compiler or
a compiler you tell you want to spend lots of time optimizing.

In general: don't write microbenchmarks where the results can be easily
statically evaluated by the compiler, unless you are testing whether the
compiler can statically evaluate it (this is a reasonable thing to want to
know of course, but it's not a test of the language).

There are also languages which will pretty much not bother to do a lot of the
the actual work, like haskell.

I don't know why people advise others to splat their compiled 3rd party
software all over /usr/local when /opt is there specifically for that purpose.

Also, enabling pthread on 1.8 has some significant performance problems unless

i don't see a difference between /opt and /usr/local , I just think it's a
matter of preference

~~~
sant0sk1
The difference is stuff installed in /opt is encapsulated inside its own
folder, whereas everything in /usr/local is shared (one bin dir, one lib dir,
etc).

So if I want to uninstall Ruby from /opt I do something like this:

    
    
        rm -rf /opt/ruby-1.8.7
    

To uninstall Ruby from /usr/local is a lot more work.

~~~
nudded
you could actually do the same in /usr/local. all you need to do is install
all packages to their own folder (eg /usr/local/custom/ruby-1.8.7) and then
symlink the binary to /usr/local/bin.

<http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/tree/> is a package manager that tries to do
just that

Seems like you might as well do it in opt then, since it is far less common to
encapsulate things in folders in local.

I've tried a few meal kit companies (blue apron and hello fresh) and I was
underwhelmed by the product and the service.

Whole Foods ingredients + Amazon delivery = game over for most of these meal
kit companies.

They would be able to provide users added levels of customization and probably
same day or next day delivery whereas with most meal kit companies, you have
to lock in your menu for the week the prior week, which is inconvenient if
plans change.

Ultimately, I'm excited about this move as I shop at whole foods regularly and
look forward to the ease of delivery that Amazon provides.

I wonder where Amazon will target next; they've already targeted grocery and
meal kit delivery and revealed plans to compete with Zillow and Redfin this
week in real estate. Which industry is next?

------
lubujackson
As someone who has used and enjoyed meal kits (Good Eggs, not Blue Apron), I
don't think this is a slam dunk for Amazon. Meal kits are a lot more than
recipes and portioning.

I have 2 small kids so meal planning is hard to do consistently. I can whip up
a chicken breast and veggie, but what I get from Good Eggs is seasonal recipes
and fresh produce sourced directly from local farmers PLUS prepared elements
including marinated meat and sauces.

So when I cook a meal kit I'm getting a much better meal (more like a dinner
party meal) for about the same effort as a barebones meal I would make
otherwise.

I have used Instacart and bought prepared stuff from Whole Foods, and there
just isn't a comparison. In SF, I often get or see old/bruised produce in
Whole Foods which used to be consistently good.

It's hard to gauge your level of expertise from your post, but if you're a
fairly non-technical person (don't mean to offend), you may be better off
looking at some sort of pre-built option. Amazon offers "stores" where people
can go set up their own shop. eBay's another option (although they're kind of
ghetto these days).

If you're determined to go it on your own, take a look at some of the really
great open-source e-commerce packages out there (Google it). After a few
clicks, you're usually in to adding products.

Especially with E-commerce, it's better to test the waters with something
before you invest a ton of time in it. Don't build something from scratch at
this stage.

Simple answer: because Android is not Java. It's a compeletely different

write programs for it's virtual machine.

edblarney
It is de-facto Java.

It uses java syntax, java libraries.

To say it is 'not Java' is borderline disingenuous.

Technically, there are differences which are real, and it's very fair to point
them out.

But - Java syntax + java.lang/java.io/java.net/java.reflect/java.util + a vm,
can use a JAVA IDE and java build chain, use 3rd party java libs ...

=> it's java.

~~~
hhandoko
I don't think this analogy is accurate.

It uses Java as the development language, but it has different runtime, not
simply a different platform / target, and thus different rules apply.

In regards with the Java libraries, I think this is pretty much already
covered in the Google vs Oracle case. Android provides a system implementation
that matches the interface, thus these code can work almost seamlessly.
Similar to how .NET and Mono works.

~~~
edblarney
The Google case showed that they had the right to implement the interface -
legally, but that doesn't mean it's not Java.

Syntax = Java Standard Libs = Java 3rd Party Libs = Java Fully interoperable
with Java Java IDE's Java Toolchain

= It's Java.

There can hardly be a pragmatic argument against this.

The Google case is a weird one that ultimately involved the nature of APIs and
if they can be copyrighted, but by any reasonable definition ... it's Java.

Note that they don't give it 'another name' \- so what programming language do
you use for Android?

Ask 1000 developers and they will say 'Java'.

They won't say 'something that is exactly like Java, but not actually

> The biggest downfall of Internet Explorer 6-8 is lack of support for
> transparent PNGs.

No. It's not. The. Biggest downfall is the total lack of advanced CSS
selectors, forcing you into adding needless classes and/or additional non-
semantic tags.

Also, IE 6 and 7 are full of bugs even in the little CSS they support.
Transparent PNGs have been solved long ago. So have the various bugs, but the
workarounds needed are much more painful to develop and maintain.

Using various libraries to patch in missing functionality only seems to work
until you reach real-world complexity with your DOM at which point you will
run into any of the countless performance issues with IEs JavaScript
implementation which relies on COM marshaling for all of its DOM support, so
all these patch-ie-to-add-missing-features-using-JS projects are practically
nothing but nice demos.

The moment you can at least target IE 8 and you can start to rely on CSS
having more ore less the intended effect without stacking hack upon hack, the
moment you get to use stuff like display: table, that moment you will see how
much you miss by staying in the late 90ies with the code you are writing.

~~~
tumultco
You're correct, as many of these hacks to fall down in many cases or in
unexpected ways. We've got hacks upon hacks to get them to work decently!
These are items we (or tools) can manage though.

From our user perspective, non-transparent PNG in IE6 is the major problem.
Partial transparency and 24-bit color support are vital for artist assets and
not having them can influence the entire design.

drivebyacct2
To each their own, but this sounds like an enormous nightmare in places. Did
they do analysis to determine that support IE6 was worth the developer

        private func addConstraints() {
            introduction.attach(sides: [.top, .leading, .trailing], 8.layoutGuideRespecting)
            contact
                .attach(sides: [.leading, .trailing], 8)
                .space(8, .below, introduction)
            spinner.center()
            error
                .attach(sides: [.leading, .trailing], 8)
                .space(8, .below, contact)
    
            create.attach(sides: [.top, .bottom, .trailing], 3)
        }
    

And honestly the stuff I needed to do to get CSS working let alone cross-
browser until very recently was really not as consistent, clean or predictable
as auto layouts. I think you just got used to the suffering.

The only thing I really like about CSS is the arbitrary lines you can draw in
the sand like "if it gets over 1000px wide then move the menu to the right".

Justified Representation Axioms (2017/2018)

Abstract:

"Social choice is replete with various settings including single-winner
voting, multi-winner voting, probabilistic voting, multiple referenda, and
public decision making. We study a general model of social choice called sub-
committee voting (SCV) that simultaneously generalizes these settings. We then
focus on sub-committee voting with approvals and propose extensions of the
justified representation axioms that have been considered for proportional
representation in approval-based committee voting. We study the properties and
relations of these axioms. For each of the axioms, we analyze whether a
representative committee exists and also examine the complexity of computing
and verifying such a committee."

Not so with government tech. With even small projects, you are beholden to
policies that were written several levels up. Things like no cloud-based
hosting, no sites that don't use government-written style guidelines, and in
many cases, no development that occurs outside the government facility. If you
hamstrung pretty much any private tech company with the same restrictions
government contractors have to deal with, I can guarantee you they would look
a lot different.

That's not to say that change can't occur, but to attack the contractors is to
misunderstand the root cause of why government software is historically so
bad. There are actually many, many very talented developers and software
engineers steeped in the latest lean startup theories inside the beltway, but
they can seldom use any of that because government policies stand in their
way. For most projects, you are dealing with literally thousands of
regulations throughout the development process, and most software apps have to
account for ever-changing laws and policies that are specific to each
application.

However I have already seen a great deal of positive change, with many
agencies opening their minds to newer, faster methods of development and
allowing better tools to be used.

How long will it take for MRAM to be used instead of DRAM? - runeks

So after Everspin has successfully produced MRAM on a standard 90 nm process, I'm starting to wonder how long it will take for it to decline enough in price for it to be a viable replacement for/addition to DRAM. I found this[1] chart on the price of flash storage, and according to this chart a 100-fold decrease in price took place in about 5 years. According to this guy from Everspin[2] the current cost of their MRAM is 100 times higher than DRAM.<p>Do you think it's realistic that it will happen this fast - or faster - with MRAM?<p>I'm pretty excited about MRAM. I mean, think about how awesome it is to not worry about a machine losing its RAM content after being turned off. It's especially useful in mobile devices, since they don't need to refresh RAM content in standby mode.<p>[1] https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bTMlHXSMEJHhgkUksSCTu1uupNMVZkgl-5C2vOg-8dsX5oX2Tc2WdPeozlUdWKmQpMZ7xX5sBbw8FDn_kZq42NtzO-E7Gwjj065JRXC3ZH-cCsjmOt8

Honestly, I'm predicting never. PCM maybe, but even that is a stretch.

The real question is whether the cell size of MRAM is smaller than DRAM in
process-independent units (F^2) and at what rate the cell size is improving.

runeks
I see. So the real problem is density?

There's a company here that is developing 4Gbit pS-MRAM modules on a 65 nm

I love where this is going. I now use Chrome's Dev channel or a WebKit nightly
for development, and only launch Firefox/Firebug to do compatibility testing.

Although I still have a ton of respect for Firefox's rendering engine, the
browser just feels wrong on the Mac -- not to mention it's slow launch times.
The Inspector Panel has caught up to Firebug's functionality in many areas and
is now starting to surpass it.

What kills me is launching IE in a VM and discovering how archaic its
developer tools are.

I would be the last one to defend IE in general but have you had a look at the

I haven't, I will test those out for sure.

IE8, of course, is the least troublesome but it's good to have options.

It has IE7 "Mode", so you can use the IE8 dev tools to debug IE7 issues.

I've gotten more used to the inspector, but I absolutely hate the style
inspector. Firebug got it right with making it look like your own CSS. Also I
often times can't edit a style rule, and I'm not sure why that is.

I hope those things change and improve. It doesn't seem like they want to go
the Firebug route with the CSS style inspector.

It blows my mind they didn’t have sane PKI with that many resources. It seems
like even the “small” initial team of a couple devs, a manager, _and a
director_ would’ve at least spun up a vault instance to use as a CA.

Also, easy for me say from the peanut gallery, but don’t understand why they
couldn’t have done rolling consul restarts to update the configs, I’ve done
this many times on consul clusters.

Not mine. Inhouse CA management is a true PITA, even multiple-thousand-people
companies regularly fuck this up. I have experienced hours of outage because
someone failed to renew the certificate for one of the thousands of pieces
making up a Cisco network environment, and don't get me started on the drama
that is root CA certificate rollover, experienced this in three companies and
nowhere it was painless...

TheCondor
I have seen this more than a couple times, at big places with resources to
manage it. Is it just me or does the TLS and PKI tooling just seem weak? I
keep thinking there should be some badass tool that helps manage this sort of
thing, is there something I don’t know about?

~~~
mschuster91
It's not just the tooling that's weak, it's also terminology and education. If
you're not dabbling in crypto occasionally, half the OpenSSL manual and 100%
of its codebase will be like hieroglyphs... leading to the fact that most
organizations put the operation of their PKI to the one person who can
successfully manage to get a working HTTPS cert after copypasting shit from
Stackoverflow and wrangling with the validation tool of their certificate
vendor.

What also really bothers me is that there is no way that (assuming I own the

Whenever a site writes an article and then goes to play a tournament, it
always annoys me that they never bother writing more clearly about it (I know
it's also a brevity and reader attention span thing, but still). Should the
author have just called with AQ? Who knows, it all depends on who raised,
which position that player raised from, the author's current position, and the
stack of each player (there's more but at least what I mentioned).

Position is one of the most important concepts in poker, and it's simple to
understand and explain. The fact that this article never uses that word once
means it has failed, even as a basic introductory article.

Back to the tournament: the author suddenly remembering effective stack, while
also having an M barely >0\. This is hilariously awful. It also means that the
author losing was probably not unlucky since the author barely had any chips.
I just glossed through the MIT site, and if you read page 10 on the tournament
lecture from the MIT website, it pretty much spells this out.

~~~
bcassedy
Also, there's just some plain painful stuff in there. "(the flop) reveals the
straight I've been chasing is no longer a possibility"? You don't really
"chase a straight" preflop and AQ is a not a hand that even the biggest noob
would refer to in that way preflop. It seems the author just wanted to include
something about "chasing", context be damned.

mapunk
I got the same feeling reading the article, but you have to realize that it's
written by a self-proclaimed "total novice." There's obviously going to be

And this is from a site where the whole point is to upload images.

Now lets imagine Ebay implemented this; the idea that most of that sites users
would comprehend the extent of a little tick box is, I feel, minimal.

I obviously am 100% behind freely licensing content - and do a lot of the sort
of work he mentions in getting image/content releases by email. But I also
dislike the idea of essentially misleading people and then telling them they
have no way to go back on the license (yes, this happens).

I might be an outlier here in my criticism. But Commons, in my experience,
tends to treat non-Commons people (especially image copyright owners) like
crap. That is what needs to be fixed first, before any pressure is applied to
companies like Ebay...

~~~
neilk
> But Commons, in my experience, tends to treat non-Commons people (especially

I feel this is unfair. They treat _everybody_ like crap.

On the other hand, they are very scrupulous about obeying licenses.

Anyway, the underlying assumption of the OP is that Wikimedia Commons actually
wants more images. Surprisingly, this is not the case, at least, it's not a
universal sentiment among Commons volunteers. Many of them believe they are
curating a set of the best free images, not making an indiscriminate
collection. Some see Commons as just a set of images to illustrate Wikipedia
with, and don't believe it has a separate mission to collect other free
imagery.

Also, Commons is already overwhelmed policing the content that gets uploaded.
Unlike Flickr or other image hosts, there's no mission of self-expression
there; instead, they believe every image must be correctly licensed, well
categorized, and useful to someone else (and not spam or otherwise
inappropriate). What's needed right now are more community tools for managing
the influx.

You're right that there's no way we can explain CC licensing to eBayers. We
can't even get that right on Flickr, and there are significant problems even
on Wikimedia Commons itself. No matter what you tell people, make them click
on, whatever, they persist in a primitive folk belief - by creating the image,
they get to

True, but that means you can store 1/8th of your $50 thumbdrive there. Where
Google wins is the cost of buying additional storage, which is an order of

utility as a backup environment is quite limited.

zmimon
> it doesn't look like Google offers synchronization so its utility as a

Actually, my beef with all these services is the opposite: they rarely provide
support to mount plain old drives under windows. It's always some crappy web
interface or custom client that synchs stuff around which makes it non-
interoperable with every other program I use that just wants to save something
to the file system and know that it got to the cloud. I really don't get it -
Windows supports WebDAV - what is so freakin hard about this?

I really wish they would just give me a network drive to save to and let _me_
worry about finding some synchronization software to mirror stuff there if
that turns me on.

The problem is that they are often willing to ignore an area until they get

Unless you mean state or federal law, that won't do anything, because " _The

if they have to spend twice as much as in LittleTown, Arkansas 5 miles down
the road. SmallTown can put whatever requirements they want into the law. Wal-
Mart just won't build there until they change the law.

Of course, whether SmallTown should want Wal-Mart is a valid question.
Unfortunately, they probably do, because Wal-Mart moving into LittleTown will
probably decimate the local retail economy anyway.

mangeletti
I was recently describing my thoughts about the future of big box retail
stores to my brother, except it's not as optimistic as to project our current
state of affairs into the future. I imagine, at a point when hardly anybody
can afford decent housing, that a _lot_ of retail spaces will be squatted as
housing.

Take, for instance, a Best Buy. A Best Buy could potentially house hundreds,
especially considering the vertical space (think bunk-style shelves for
sleeping). I'm not suggesting this is good or that it would be comfortable,
but we've got more than 4 million people working retail in the US, and retail
is going nowhere fast.

IOW, in the markedly more dystopian future that I imagine, a lot of the same
people that work in these big boxes will live in these big boxes.

Cool little app. One little improvement I thought of though, is to move the
inline styles into the header, even if you're just using class names like
"code1", "code2", etc.

It would just make it a bit easier to read the source code or change the code
colors if you ever needed to. It should also give you a small decrease in the
actual code size, which could matter if you were posting a lot of code on a
heavily-visited site.

The reason I wrote this tool is because some blog hosting providers don't
allow to inject custom CSS or javascript into the <header>

There are already quite a few solutions for those who can modify the header,
the most famous is <http://alexgorbatchev.com/wiki/SyntaxHighlighter>

I think you can register CSS classes via JavaScript...so if they couldn't put

With a mix of permamagnetic polymagnets, electropermanent magnet arrays plus
classical electromagnets, you could definitely do that.

You could have certain static guiding patterns, switchable EPM arrays for
creating modifiable sub-patterns (and strengths) within the static ones, and
the electromagnets for finely adjusting strengths and for pulling objects
around.

For one, EPM:s could be used for programmable attachment/removal to a magnetic
guiding system by either attracting an object with the polymagnet spring
mechanism and then letting it into a magnetic rail, or by pushing it off by
mirroring its magnetic field.

address, it makes it simple to refuse mail to compromised addresses at the

A hobby business is not a business, it's a hobby and hobbies cost money.

If you plan on this being a business you have to figure out first how much
turnover you have to make to make a go of it, and if $13 / month for a bank is
a make-or-break decision then I would suggest you look long and hard at
whether or not this is a feasible endeavor.

For sure it is possible that you'll be doing this expense out-of-pocket for a
while, but then you just put all these expenses against your future revenues.

A typical small business, including all overhead, such as administration, tax
filings, equipment and so on will cost you at least $200 / month, so if your
projected profits when this thing is up and running are lower than that you
really should reconsider your plans.

This is not meant to demoralize you, I just think that if you doubt about
spending $13/month that you have other issues than choosing the right bank.

I chose mine for reliability, easy access to international banking, the fact
that my balance is insured to a serious amount and so on, the 'costs per
transaction' and 'monthly fees' were the least of the considerations.

The recent crisis has born out the wisdom of that decision, by going with a
large but cooperative bank they were hit very little by the affairs that
caused their main competitor to now be mostly state property.

As with most things in life bank fees like this are more often then not are
negotiable. Make an appointment with the branch manager or business specialist
at your BoA branch and voice your concerns about fees like these, and how they
would make it difficult for you to continue banking with them.

For anyone thinking of opening a separate account for business the first place
to start would be the bank you use for your checking/savings account. Not only
do you have an established relationship (if only in paper form) but the will
work harder to please you if there's a chance they'd lose your non-business

I'm using Dropbox Paper since quite a while and I love it. For PCs it is
completely browser based and therefore works nicely on every platform - no
native apps needed. It has mobile apps. I cancelled my Evernote subscription
and account on the spot.

The only real downside at the moment from my point of view is that it does not
yet have an offline mode.

It's not terrible. Personally, since I write in Markdown, it's an excellent
tool for my niche documents. It doesn't integrate with Jekyll, but it's close
enough. Simplenote is another decent app that happens to have Markdown
support, but the implementation isn't very good. No image previews, no tables,
and on occasion it will outright mess up the formatting in `code blocks`.

Of course, I am very hesistant to put my full trust into Dropbox. Their Mac
app has been known to work around security measures in macOS[0].

min throwing together [http://mrkdwn.pro](http://mrkdwn.pro) \- you can feed
it any direct MD file URL and it will render it in Github flavored markdown.
You can also directly go to a file like so:

Ask HN: Do you want Screenhero back? (Screenhero-cofounder here) - jsherwani
Screenhero (YC W13) was acquired by Slack, and our tech powers Slack Calls. Today, Slack announced it&#x27;s sunsetting Screenhero-style screen sharing in Slack Calls.<p>I know there are lots of people that loved Screenhero, and I&#x27;m curious if your needs are being met through existing alternatives (Tuple, UseTogether, Zoom). If not, I&#x27;m considering working on a successor.<p>FYI I&#x27;ve been working on rebooting my previous startup in the remote desktop space, and have built Scrn (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scrn.app) with a small team.

_" Sometimes I wonder how many things could have gone differently."_

I'm a firm believer that awesome always finds a way, but I love these stories
of seemingly small decisions ( _" I could’ve spent the $500 on something other
than a Rift. I could’ve stayed in bed"_) being major turning points in
someone's life.

For me, a pivotal moment was Stanley Kubrick's removal of _A Clockwork Orange_
from circulation in the 1970s, and its subsequent posthumous re-release in
2000. My university cinema had a showing one night; this gave me time to kill
on campus after the library closed; during which time I saw a job-board ad for
work in a real estate firm.

The job led to a management position post-graduation, which turned into State
Operations Manager for a large franchise group, which turned into the business
coaching career I've had for almost a decade.

If Kubrick hadn't pulled the film? If he had died a year earlier? Maybe I
would have leveraged my journalism degree into that profession instead? From
little things, big things grow...

Neat Introductory Graph Theory Solutions - Locke1689
http://blog.commentout.net/post/1234124430/on-bipartite-graphs

======
anorwell
The chessboard-domino problem isn't related to hamiltonian paths in bipartite
graphs. For a minimal counter-example, the path of length 2 is bipartite and
has a hamiltonian path, but has an odd number of vertices so there is clearly
no way to cover it with dominoes. You can also find counter-examples in the
other direction (bipartite, domino-coverable, not hamiltonian), but they take
a bit more effort to describe.

The generalized chessboard problem is to find a perfect matching
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_matching>) in a graph: that is, a set
of edges that cover each vertex, but don't touch any other edge in the set.
This problem is a lot easier than finding a hamiltonian path, which is NP-
complete.

~~~
Locke1689
Well, they're not related in that they are not the same problem, but they are
related in that you can solve both using the properties of bipartite graphs.

I think I was correct in the post—I never actually stated that domino-covering
is equivalent to the Hamiltonian path problem. The entire point of the post
was really that we can use graph theory to generalize certain properties and
solve a number of different unrelated problems, not to equate all problems.

I did mistakenly imply that the domino covering was a path (which you're
right, it's not) at one point. I have edited the post for clarity.

Just to add to what you said - that's not at all exclusive to the FBI or the
USA. Up here in Canada, the RCMP spent huge amounts of money trying to catch
two "terrorists" that they basically created. These two people lacked the
means and motive to carry out any kind of attack, but our federal police
service wasn't deterred. A team of 240 officers worked to groom them and
provide them with fake explosives. They found two naive, isolated drug
addicts, then isolated them even further and tried to plant extremist ideology
into their heads. Even then, at several points, they asked their undercover
handler for any kind of moral justification for why they SHOULD NOT go through
with the attack, and the undercover officer did the exact opposite. In the
end, they _still_ wanted to back out but were afraid that the undercover
officer would kill them in retaliation.

Their case was so egregious that our Supreme Court overturned the conviction
on the grounds that if the RCMP had done nothing, the two wouldn't have done
anything worthy of criminal charges. To make matters even worse, the RCMP
billed for almost a million dollars worth of overtime alone manufacturing a
fake terrorist plot.

Minecraft isn't just a game anymore. It is a cultural touchstone. An entire
generation has been introduced to video games through Minecraft.

Furthermore, the gameplay effectively can go on forever. Especially with mods
on PC, there are very few limits to what can be done. Entire separate games
(e.g. Hunger Games mod) have been implemented.

Also, it's one of the best-selling games of all time. That helps. No one bats
an eye when, say, Puyo Puyo Tetris gets released and ported. (Yes, I just
compared Minecraft to Tetris.)

I am somewhat disappointing that Samsung with their NX line exited the market,

I do not think vanilla mobile OSes are right platform for the camera...

If anything, I suspect these companies have the people (or could get them),
but they have to change their culture across marketing/support/software
engineering areas. Not just how they do business, but how they hire.

What features are you referring to? Personally as someone who likes to take
photos, I find the tactile multi-button/dial interface ideal and don't want a
menu driven touch UI. It seems like some people want to co-opt a camera type
made primarily for photography and turn it into a social media focused
camcorder. I know the companies are trying to tap into that market but it
feels like it is turning cameras into jacks of all trades and masters of none.
I find the pricing obscene, but some current Leica models are stills only and
have very elegant and simple interfaces designed purely for taking
photographs. There are high quality cinema cameras all over to choose from. It
seems people are pulling the DLSR/interchangeable lens mirrorless camera
market in two different directions with opposing goals...photography vs social
media/video production.

If it's right for artists to expect, even demand, payment for the value they
provide, then piracy is wrong.

If it's alright to extract value from people's work without compensating them
as long as they aren't directly impacted, piracy is OK.

That is the debate in a nutshell.

~~~
flipbrad
Gee, is the nutshell really so small that it can only include your perspective
of the debate, rather than the other side's views, or those of moderates?

In fact, the piracy is theft misrepresentation is a core maxim of the pro-
industrial stance on copyright enforcement. it is precisely because people
view it as dishonest deprivation (theft) that people have a problem with
nonmarket, unlicensed sharing of cultural elements.

Yet such positions are rarely precisely defined (and this is true of the other
side as well, mind you) - if we accept lost sales as a valid consideration,
where does one stop? A slow browser in a newsagent's shop is chased out, and
puts down a potential purchase. or isn't chased out, and enjoys - but doesn't
pay for - several articles. An influential reviewer, having a bad day,
communicates his distaste for a work without tempering his words; at a stroke,
ten thousand potential sales are 'lost', the artist is deprived ten thousand
times over. Copyright on a work expires (75 years after the death of the
artist) - the artist is (sort of?) deprived (or rather, his estate is, or he
was, back in the day). People are being deprived of something totally
artificial which was granted to them and them unwaveringly, thanks to the
Disney lobby, enhanced. Copyright reform has always gone in one direction and
it remains illegal to format shift your own belongings in the UK. The debate
in a nutshell includes people who'd like to see things swing back in the other
direction, without necessarily eradicating copyright, simply because each
extension of copyright (a state-granted monopoly right over what you can
communicate and reproduce for the benefit of others) grants benefits to the
rightsholders at the sacrifice of the commons, and of my rights to use my
property (CD burners, CDs, books, etc) freely.

scrumper
Interesting enough. Perhaps 3.9% of the respondents didn't like having their
time wasted with a survey, so decided to be deliberately awkward in every
response they made. This would seem to fit in with the 'lumberjacks' being
older and having a lower income than other respondents: both characteristics
can be associated with a kind of hard-nosed practicality and a disdain for
treehuggers and silly surveys.

I'm sure there's a law somewhere that says that no matter how completely
indefensible a position, there is some contrary-minded group who will loudly
proclaim allegiance to it. And if there isn't, there is now.

(Edit: OP, not suggesting your survey was silly, just that the 3.9% might have
thought so.)

The respondents in general came from one geographical part of the city and
also grade the quality of service of the city more harshly than others.

I interpret this that the parks department might be doing a really bad job in
certain parts of the city. The trees are not kept well and trimmed,
obstructing views and making driving unsafe, branches in the street after
heavy winds, something like that. Now if I already think the city is doing a
piss poor job, I'm sure not going to give them the justification they need to
raise my taxes just so they can plant more trees (when they can't be trusted
to take care of the ones that already exist).

In other words, the respondent's answer depends on the who they think is
asking the question and how they think their answer might be used.

Very good point about this specifically. They live in a poorer part of the
city. It shouldn't be that way, but it may well be that their neighbourhoods
aren't as well tended as some of the richer parts of San Francisco.

We deal with Haskell resource leaks the same way you would in C++ or Java.

We have production monitors on every host that show basic metrics like memory,
disk, and CPU utilization. Atop that, we added a tracker for the number of
suspended Haskell threads. (that is, threads which are not blocked on I/O, but
are also not running)

We found that the machines are usually able to handle requests as soon as they
come in, so if the number of Haskell threads goes above 0 for any length of
time, the machine is about an hour away from melting down.

We can restart the process without losing any connections, so this leaves us a
very comfortable margin of error.

Once we know we have a problem, it's usually pretty simple to run the heap
profiler on the process and look at recent commits. We continuously deploy, so
there's only about a 10 minute delay before a particular commit is running in
front of customers. This makes tracking regressions down really fast.

Even in cases where we can't figure out why a bit of code is leaking, we can
almost always identify it and revert it until we understand what's going on.

~~~
pmahoney
> We can restart the process without losing any connections

Would you mind expanding on this a bit? I'm not too familiar with Haskell, but
I am familiar with various was of blocking new connections while allowing
existing connections to complete, either at the load-balancer level or built-
in each individual process.

What Haskell stack are you using, and how are graceful restarts accomplished?

Thanks.

One of my coworkers wrote a really cool bit of software to do this. I want him
to open source it.

Basically, you can share a single socket amongst many servers. The OS ensures
that just one process accepts each connection.

You can therefore have a manager process that owns the socket and passes it on
to application processes.

To update, start new processes, then politely tell the old ones to go away.

To add a point, first check if it's inside the (convex) polygon found so far.
If it is, you're done. Just continue to the next point to add.

If it isn't, you walk along both directions along the (convex) polygon until
you hit the first point that doesn't violate the convexity constraint. (Just
compare slopes of the lines between the next point and the target point, and
the target point and the point to be added). Then just splice it in in place
of the chunk removed.

Now, this isn't particularly fast - O(n^3) I think, but it's still faster than
spinning up a LP solver.

(Again, I'm probably missing something.)

~~~
Trombone12
The solution demonstrated on the page seems to ask for the n-gon that
circumscribes n randomly placed points, which isn't the same as the smallest
convex hull that contains them. I'm not sure why the polygon should have the
same number sides as there are points to contain, especially since the
original tweet asks for a convex hull, but there you go.

~~~
TheLoneWolfling
Oh, ok.

That makes much more sense.

~~~
Strilanc
FYI, the algorithm you were describing was to compute a convex hull. It can be
done in O(n lg n) time by sorting the points by angle w.r.t. some starting
point and then "gift wrapping".

You can find where to add a new point in O(lg h) time with a binary search,
but you may need to eject O(h) old points. Points can only be ejected once, so
there might still be some nice aggregate bound in terms of n.

Companies have at least as much interest to do research as they have to do any

Not sure the government should be involved. Not because basic research ain't
great---in an ideal world we'd all get ponies from the government---but
because budgets are finite and there are other opportunities some of them with
more definite benefits.

less, etc.)

funded research. But---if the government wouldn't have paid for inventing
computers for the militaries, IBM came up with computers only a few years

a different song by him.

The three songs are 'From the undertow' from the album 'a curious feeling',
and 'Jerry Jackson' and 'Portrait for Jerry Jackson' from the album 'a wicked
lady'.

There is a link between the first two (the instruments) and another between
the last two (the theme).

The weirdest thing about this whole affair is that I was literally doing
nothing and the answer just jumped in to my head, that the instrumentation on
the first song matched at least part of the second. It's that 'gong' like
keyboard sound that did the trick.

Once I'd found the second the third was easy because it is on the same record.

Weirdest thing, memory. It's almost like an 'agent' got dispatched to match
each and every 1 second fragment against every other long ago and suddenly a
small match was found and reported.

However, one of the pledge bonuses is as follows:

* How load balancing is handled. Load balancing isn't just for ultra high volume sites that need multiple machines. The main use case I have for load balancing has to do with reliability, particularly when it's time to do OS patches. Most of my projects are games that have people from around the world hammering on them. It's become impossible to find a good time of day to bring things down for a couple of minutes while I reboot after an OS patch or upgrade how much memory a machine has.

* Server configuration. Automatically handling the webserver configuration is a great value to the customers. But it's helpful to know if it's deployed in a multi-threaded way like Apache MPM-Worker vs MPM-Prefork.

* Database replication, and/or automated data backup. How it works, and how you can restore.

I'm currently using Rackspace for all my stuff, and liking it. But I'm not
really looking forward to getting into HA-Proxy, and figuring out how to get
the keep-alives and so on configured properly. Perhaps I should have just used
amazon, with their dizzying array of loadbalancing and database options. The
thing that has kept me away, though, is the complexity involved in learning
all of their product offerings and my complete inability to understand how
much it'll cost. (It's like it'll be easy to figure out how much it'll cost

remote usability testing. You can share the participant's screen and it syncs
up the audio conversation with what is going on on the screen. Eye tracking is
mostly unnecessary (and not available via GTM). GTM will even allow the
session to be recorded. I also have my clients sit in and mute their line
while watching. If you have a rich talk-while-clicking protocol and you are
probing at the right times, it is pretty clear where people are having trouble
and what they are looking at. When you are done, you can edit in iMovie or
most editing software. If you want to do an exit survey, use SurveyMonkey.

Is Silicon Valley Still the Best Place to Start a Company? • Tomasz Tunguz - ttunguz

TL;DR: Not necessarily. It depends. If you care about venture funding, then
yes, 35% of funding still is silicon valley. If you care about being acquired,
then increasingly less so. If you care about IPOs, then yes lots of Silicon
Valley-based IPOs. Basically, looking at this from an exits perspective shows
Silicon Valley has an edge still.

Are those the metrics that matter though? Why does looking at this from a
purely exits perspective matter?

~~~
Waterluvian
I'm not really that knowledgeable about this. But why is funding limited by
geography? Or is it a self fulfilling prophecy?

~~~
rexreed
It shouldn't be, but it is. Lots of VCs won't invest outside their network and
outside the range of people they can physically influence. Sometimes it has to
do with sitting in on board meetings (which is increasingly less relevant).
Some of it has to do with who they can pull in from their networks for
leadership positions, most of which is geographically concentrated. But in an
increasingly more remote-first workforce, I think that's becoming less
relevant too.

Honestly I believe this article is written from a perspective that might
become increasingly less relevant over time. To your point, geography matters
now, but maybe much less so in the not-too-distant future.

it took me a long time to get into BoC but the strange thing is that I never
get sick of them. there are very few bands that do that. (Mogwai does that too
or within the hibhop genre that would be The Roots, or Mos Def).

It seems that the quicker I like a band/song the quicker I also get sick of
it. And music that I have to get used to with passive listening - e.g. have
them playing in the background but not when running or driving then the longer
I like them. Some artists and albums have literally stayed with me for
decades. (e.g. The Roots _Illadelphia Halflife_ or _Things Fall Apart_
acompanied me when my kids were born, when I got my dog, when my dog died,
when I got married, when my kids left for university, ...). Not every band is
around that long or is able to adapt its music style to remain relevant (for
my taste) ...

I remember the times when I went to buy music at record stores and there was
no way of just purchasing the top 3 tracks from an album and skip the rest.
You either bought the whole album or you got a single but there was nothing in
between. Having shelled out the money I then wanted to make an effort to also
give those songs "a chance" that didn't immediately stick. And it was always
those more complex tunes that I ended up liking the most ...

Supercomputers are increasingly used in the sciences to scale down the search
space of massively complicated problems such as protein folding, molecular
docking, and chemical synthesis. In several instances they lead us to novel,
non-intuitive results, sometimes as small as finding a functional group
prefering a gauched vs anti conformation that changes a particular interaction
completely. With drug design specifically, we can cut down the chemical search
space necessary to find inhibitor molecules and search for potential
problematic harmful interactions before ever running in vitro assays.

Science today is more serendipity and hard work than acts of sheer brilliance.
Having high-throughput tools that save us from looking too hard give us more
time to think and more quickly update our models.

Supercomputing will lead us to smarter medicine, cures for cancer, better
materials, and a more energy-efficient planet. Computer science is a major
cornerstone of today's scientific endeavors, and we increasingly need to
encourage interest and investment in this field.

Yep!

The main thing is not wanted to show potential adversaries the extent of your
capabilities. It also allows them to glean information on how to counter the
newly disclosed capability as well.

For example: If this was a satellite, the specific one is almost certainly
outed. Satellites are tracked constantly and by the angle of the photo and
approximate time you should be able to figure out where in the sky it was and
what satellites were in orbit. With that you now know to not do anything when
those are present.

If Iran isn’t capable of doing that sort of analysis, certainly every other
major power in the world is.

Frankly, I’m betting it was the X-37B or a previously unknown spy satellite
hiding in plain sight as a commercial satellite.

With so many satellites up there, I'd be surprised if you could find any
moment, anywhere on Earth, long enough that you could do something remotely

but other than that if they want to see you, they'll see you.

Getting rid of accounts also means getting rid of account management
chores...like the one here...that eat into the time needed to make the user
experience better. To be clear, no matter how good you make the signup, it is
a bad experience that stands between a user's enthusiasm for the product and
their use.

Going further, there are approximately two user experience scenarios that go
with signup.

1\. The security conscientious user will spend time thinking about security
and managing identity and assessing risk associated with adding another
account because every account increases attack surface area.

2\. The security naive user will just use an existing identity pattern and
that makes your site a more attractive target for black hat hacking and
therefore increases effort that must be exhibited on non-functional aspects of
the site.

Or to put it another way, would you rather spend your time managing an account
system or doing creating something interesting...and productive: I found your
comment from this resubmission of your site (plus an HN search):
[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15283017](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15283017).
It goes to the normal page instead of the new better experience, as would be
expected. And so my experience was worse than you hoped because it is hard to
control incoming links.

Adding signup and accounts are a task that frameworks make easier than the
important functional work. But they are hard to get right because no user
says, "I wish I had to sign up for this instead of doing the interesting thing
I came here to do." This means accounts are hard to get right. It is only the
ease with which frameworks make creating a user account system possible that
makes adding user accounts "best industry practice."

tl;dr = Treat the need for user accounts as a possible edge case.

Good luck.

bane
National distribution in the U.S. is an immense affair. Beyond the expense of
advertising in local markets, it took the intensive development of several
layers of massive infrastructure projects before we've arrived at today's
level of "effortless" distribution. The principle problem is that the United
States has no domestic East-West waterway option. No matter how good your rail
and road shipping system is (and the U.S. has among the best in the world for
freight), you can fit a lot of train's worth of goods into a single big
container ship. Rail also only gets you so far, as you need local trucking
links, large inter-modal warehouses and so-on.

What really happened was the rise of the trucking industry in the late 70s and
early 80s coinciding with the rise of big-box stores like Walmart. This built
all of the secondary and tertiary infrastructure -- and capacity -- to move
whatever stuff you wanted wherever you wanted, pretty cheaply.

However, there's also two major East-West barriers in the U.S., the
Mississippi river, which has largely been overcome but was a major geographic
barrier in an earlier age, and the Rockies, which both involve a large energy
cost to get over, but also have unreliable roads in certain areas during large
parts of the year.

Many many large brands exist only on one side of their respective barriers or
the other. Yuengling beers for example, more or less don't go any further than
the Mississippi, while Dreyers ice cream more or less go no further than the
Western Rockies.

I see no platform that will take your text (or PDF) and offer good
watermarking. Or, for that matter, _any_ watermarking besides a name and email
on every page.

Name and email is easily defeated, because this is easily stripped.

A successful system would be a multi-pronged, steganographic watermark
approach. The approach would, unfortunately, rely upon security by obscurity.

Whitespace approaches are good, but can be defeated by pdf2text followed by
PDF creation. Nonetheless, they form a decent prong.

Additionally, there is a language-model (NLP) based approach based upon
synonym substitution. Some common words can be replaced with synonyms without
significantly altering the meaning of the text. So if word A has 8
replacements, I just added three bits to my secret message, the watermark. (I
can't find the citation, sorry. If there is sufficient interest, I can dig it
up. Or email me.)

Additionally, these approaches can be improved by adding error correction, in
case there are minor modifications to the PDF.

As I said, these approaches are a weak form of security, but current
approaches offer _no_ security.

I think of floating point numbers as being good for representing real world
quantities - things you can measure with an instrument. It never matters if
you read 1.2999999999993 instead of 1.3 because every practical instrument is
less accurate than that anyway. If you start needing to test for equality,
that's a sign something's wrong in your design. You can never measure two
lengths with a ruler in real life and check if they're equal. So maybe you
should be using integers instead, or maybe you don't really need equality.

Your point 3 about rounding issues with addition disappears if you think of
the value as being a physical measurement. You just don't care about those
errors because they are always insignificant.

Isn't the problem with floats for money more a problem with the conventions of
accountants? By rounding everything to 2 decimal places, they're obviously
creating far more error than double precision's ~16 places. They just tolerate
their specific type of error by convention.

I don't know if the popularity of this on HN is a case of the emperors new

There is nothing inherently base-10 to finance or any other field. Finance
deals in _exact_ quantities but that is because it deals in exact units. E.g.
if a single stock tick is 0.1 cents, then a 0.11 cent increase is as
meaningless as a 1/30 cent increase. There is no more need to represent
arbitrary exact decimals as there is to represent arbitrary exact binary
decimals. All that finance needs is integer multiples of the relevant unit.
And presumably this is already hardcoded into their COBOL or FORTRAN code.

Nothing presented on that page made me thing that DEC64 would be useful for
anything that integer arithmetic in the right units would not be better suited
to.

tomsmeding

Thats not me being snarky, its a very serious observation - you'd get laughed

> Why?

Obviously I can't know it for sure, but my argument hinges on parallelism.
Imperative programming isn't so well suited to parallelism as you probably
know, and Python is sticking firmly to the imperative pseudo-code area of
programming (which it does very well). Even for the scripting tasks I think in
10 years time it'll just be unacceptable to have so many cores under-utilised
and functional languages make parallelism so much easier that it'll be a
fairly easy choice to start coding a new project in those languages instead of
Python. And then on top of this main argument, I'll just say you never know -
I don't think people would have predicted the decline Perl has had to such a
big degree (sure its not dead but its going that way). Python won't be here in
100 years (or 200, or 300..), I'm 100% sure. So I'm just arguing that the
actual number of years left of Python is likely to be within 30 years. No-one
knows the exact length, but my prediction is that its within that range.

> What makes Scheme and Haskell "long-term" languages?

They're just very simple and pure, and that's important for longevity because
they aren't likely to be replaced in a kind of "major revision change" by a
similar but better language, because they don't really need a big revision
change, they're very good (or should I say "good enough") already. Python just
doesn't so obviously provide the best language of

Quoting chris_wot1:

Flaw 1: I didn't say no illegal immigrants are talented. Let's say odds for an
illegal immigrant to be talented is 50/50, while we know skilled workers like
this kid is 100% talented (track record proven so far) -- so why makes it easy
for the former group but not the latter?

Flaw 2: If there are slots available, they should be allocated to talented
individuals. Evidence has shown many entrepreneurs and college graduates
(legitimately) have gone back to their countries because of inability to
obtain visas here.

Flaw 3: It's a bad thing. If you compare it to how tough it is for a legal,
skilled worker to come here. Besides, I personally know countless people are
planning to send their kids here illegally before 15 to benefit from this new
regulation. But that's the whole new debate. My only point here is: Why not
make it easier for talented individuals instead of illegal immigrants?

Isn't the obvious solution to this problem the enforcement of existing laws

Or conversely, if the government is so weak that it can't stop the taxi
cartels from fighting bloody battles, surely it's also too weak to enforce cab
licensing laws.

buyx
Yes, the fundamental problem is a weak state.

However, deregulating the industry made the problem far worse than it could
have been. Our law enforcement is not entirely ineffectual, and a permit
system would have provided more control than a free-for-all, by moderating
supply. Buses remained more tighly controlled and I don't see bus warfare
(there is an upward trend in accidents involving buses though I think that has
more to do with poorly skilled drivers than profit-seeking).

jessriedel
It's worth pointing out that many commentors in the last thread on this case
justified the historic price regulation of cabs by municipalities based mostly
off _safety issues_ , and often said that it was reasonable for the government
to continue to so regulate even when technology disrupted the industry:

<http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4221589>

<http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4221844>

<http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4221747>

But the city council gets some angry emails from constituents about blocking
Uber and what do they do? Remove the minimum prices requirements _without_ any
compensating changes to the safety regulations. (Presumably, Uber cabs already
satisfy the safety rules for dispatched sedans.)

So, whatever you think about cab regulation in the abstract, I think this is
good evidence that the mechanism for how the government actually makes
regulatory decisions bares no relation to abstract arguments. The government
officials are just human beings responding to their various incentives.

since it's an order of magnitude faster in tests I've seen.

But lz4 seems to still be the champion for raw throughput speed with decent
compression, this might change (have changed?) with the negative compression
modes in zstd.

It would be interesting to hear from people who've got a bit more hands on
experience with zstd in theses contexts.

The dictionary training, would that be applicable on a dataset/volume in a FS
context? It would be awesome if for instance I have a dataset for jpg and
another for raw-photos and I could get some good compressions for those.

Media usually yields quite bad compression ratios using more traditional
compression formats, dedupe can improve this some but usually requires large
DDTs (deduplication tables). Could the dictionary training be an alternative
in these cases?

Interesting! At some point I have started creating small shell functions to
switch between environments (setting the correct paths, etc.). This was when I
was mainly doing C, C++, and Prolog work.

In my last two positions I primarily work on mavenized Java projects and find
that IntelliJ projects provide most of the context switching.

The upside is that it is far less work to set up and customise projects than
vim/emacs plus shell. The downside is that the customisation that you can do
is far more limited.

I'd love to hear experiences from someone who works on Python or Ruby code,

Ok, let's give your skyscraper a nice 80' x 200' floor plate. A 100 stories
up, and you've probably spent a billion dollars on construction and land and
entitlement...at least in the US. Less some other parts of the world, more in
others.

You're only half way to matching the tallest building, have just put an
additional million and a half feet of expensive space into the local real-
estate market, and your costs are only going up.

But that doesn't really paint the right picture about how expensive it is to
build upward beyond a half dozen stories or so rather than building outward or
just cramming more into less space.

No to put the cost of building upward in perspective: the great pyramid was
the tallest building for nearly 4000 years. Lincoln Cathedral was then the
tallest ever built for more than 500 [250 years if you want to say it lost the
title when the spire collapsed, which brings up the point that the great
pyramid would have been, but for erosion the tallest structure from 1647 to
1874, but was still the second tallest in the age of steam and iron].

So yeah, it's expensive and hard and unless you're the Pharaoh doesn't serve
much purpose.

Really glad to see Aeon gaining traction. Their editorial voice runs counter
to the dominant academic convention that separates liberal arts and humanities
from the hard sciences and mathematics.

It's not about putting them together, so much as recognizing how artificial
the distinction is in the first place. Both branches are fundamentally
imaginative. To use a rough analogy, they're like the left and right sides of
a single brain - neither of which is sufficient by itself.

If they've got one writer who stands out, it's Ross Anderson. Two of the best
pieces they published were done by him. If you're familiar with the Clock of
the Long Now and the larger effort to cultivate a sense of deep time, these
are exceptionally worthwhile. Can't recommend them highly enough.

Now my questions are:<p>1- We are focusing on one market and it looks like our message is working, we are spending ~$1 per day to get the word out, is that a good thing?<p>2- What&#x27;s the best way to quickly educate the user about how to use the app?<p>3- Is it possible to ask for a seed fund at this stage?

1) One consideration is scale: Estonia's population is around the size of a
city, 1.3 million, about equivalent to SF and Oakland combined. It's land area
is around 17,500 sq miles; a U.S. state of that size would be the 42nd
largest, between West Virginia and Maryland.

That doesn't diminish the services for thier citizens; to the extent that they
enhance government through tech, that's great. But if you are comparing
countries, it's much different to organize and service 1.3 than 300 million.
In fact, if I were running a small nation (something I know nothing about), I
might use that relative nimbleness as a competitive advantage.

But wouldn't applying tech for very big populated countries would be better? I
mean: the more people are contributing to an "open source" project, the better
it is

So in the end, I feel like that if big countries would be more "open" by going
in the e-government sense, we would have a "Linux" government (I admit that I
really don't know nothing about this, but I find this very interesting).

It would be good if you could categorise your source code comments somehow and
have your IDE help manage them.

By default you would browse code with important summary comments visible, but
if you're interested in any one area, you could then drill down into much more
detailed and text dense comments right within your editor to read about design
decisions and the bigger picture in plain English.

Comments could be further categorised into, say, business logic related
comments or those related to design patterns, or page flow or test cases or
internationalization or whatever, giving you more options to learn about the
code and drill into the specific area you care about.

This readily accessible living documentation would be a much better way of
learning about code bases in plain English without consulting out-of-date

I'm utterly terrified of any CS curriculum that allows a student to graduate
having taken only one year (three quarter-long classes) that require
programming. What are those students going to do when they graduate? Manage? I
guess it's Stanford, so they can always just join a startup...

~~~
akeefer
The point of a top-tier university education in CS is much more the
theoretical side of things (lambda calculus, graphics theory, np-completeness,
algorithms, discrete math, etc.), which most people are less likely or able to
pick up on their own. Programming as a skill requires constant practice for
years, just like writing, and isn't something you can teach as easily in a 10-
or 15-week course.

I would say that especially at higher-end universities, there's also an
assumption that you'll figure out the programming part on your own. The rather
brutal CS 248 class at Stanford, for example, requires you (or at least used
to) write a 3D game using OpenGL, while the class itself is solely concerned
with graphics theory, techniques, and algorithms: it doesn't cover OpenGL in
the least, and the students are expected to learn it, along with whatever
other technologies they need to write the game (input, sound, etc.) on their
own.

That means that, yes, you can graduate with a BSCS without being a good
programmer. You can also get an MS or Ph.D. in CS without being a great
programmer. As a general rule, theoretical computer science and programming
are very different skills, and knowledge of one aspect does not confer
knowledge of the other. From all the interviewing I've done over the years, I
think I can safely say that those rules apply to graduates of pretty much any
college, not just Stanford.

He's not "rubbing it in", he's pointing out some harsh truths. Perhaps mostly
about how most people define "big picture", but in general they need to be
said.

I'll go one step further; in a followup, the author said "[T]he leadership of
the company is excellent" when that is demonstrably not so. Just sticking to
the technical management part of things, the leadership of this company has
known, and should have realized what it meant, that for that last year they
had a key coder who was producing unmaintainable code. For the last half year
this guy has been melting down and is now non-functional. Yet he is still a
"co-founder".

They don't seem to have then necessary sense of urgency about this emergency
("We're in trouble (in _my_ estimation only) because no startup can afford to
have a key person take a dive, and every developer is key.").

This is an existential crisis for the venture and there's probably nothing
more important for them to do at the moment than resolving it with a good
plan, which I just don't get the impression is happening.

~~~
pw0ncakes
Fair point.

We believed that the unmaintainable code problem would be less of an issue
after launch, and that this person knew his codebase well enough to keep it on
life support until that point, at which we could hire people to fix the
problem, possibly with aid of post-launch funding. We assumed it was benign
"technical debt" -- a bad technical situation that can be paid off later when
resources are less scarce.

What we didn't count on was the meltdown of the person responsible for the
problematic code. In hindsight, we should have seen it coming, but it seems
like there are always things going wrong in a startup, and _everything_ seems
urgent.

I've wanted for a while to fire this guy, throw out his code, and rebuild
everything from scratch, but have been under the impression that we don't have
the time/turning room to do this. I'm not experienced enough to know the
externals (e.g. how hard it is to get funding, etc.) and whether or not this

Ok I see, KT provides a visible log of all changes happening to a given key,
but my initial question still stands: I can squat, say, eschmidt@google.com
today and wait for someone to pay me a huge amount of money to give up that
name ?

~~~
Ajedi32
I'm not 100% sure, but it sounds like that's outside the scope of key
transparency, and Google is envisioning that the ["certification authority
that the system [represents]"][1] would verify that you indeed own
`eschmidt@google.com` before letting you register an account using that
address.

Having worked at NXP for a short time, I agree with you but I have the
impression that most of the unwillingness to be open (with those things it
makes perfect sense to be open about) comes from laziness and fear of
unintended consequences.

The center of gravity of power is held by groups with security focuses and
they're supposed to be professional paranoids... It's just unfortunate that
the least effort, safest decision for many other folks is one which can be
seen as consistent with what those groups would have made.

Perhaps it's because I'm Canadian and have lived in a world of "constantly
aware of US politics but not governed by them" but I find the attitude the OP
is now discarding to be superbly and painfully naive. Basically delusional.
Imagine the feeling you would get when someone tells you "I entered by credit
card number in that 'check if your credit card has been stolen' banner ad and
it said I was safe, so that's good news". Same feeling.

So while I'm glad the realization has been had, and the childish notion has
been discarded, I'm really worried that this is some kind of common idea among
educated non-Americans. Is the ability to read newspapers or follow politics

Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos), Woody Guthrie:

[...]

The sky plane caught fire over Los Gatos Canyon,

A fireball of lightning, and shook all our hills,

Who are all these friends, all scattered like dry leaves?

The radio says, "They are just deportees"

Is this the best way we can grow our big orchards?

Is this the best way we can grow our good fruit?

To fall like dry leaves to rot on my topsoil

And be called by no name except "deportees"?

This is some time after 1948. Then, just as now, there were people who saw
non-citizens as barely humans, in the US and everywhere else. But then there
was Woody Guthrie as well, and the many people like him who saw the human in

5am - 3pm. After that - it's a downhill slide

The software will run a command line usable via nc on port 23, and also an
HTTP server on port 80. To get the HTTP server to actually serve files, an SD
card image with FAT filesystem needs to be created and the web interface files
put into it (I can explain if anyone wants to try).

What is to be done is a minimal example for integrating the stack and
corresponding documentation. For example how to integrate with the reactor,
which is abstract from the perspective of the stack but must follow a specific
interface. The stack itself only uses timers since other event sources would
be used for I/O by e.g. interface drivers. Currently there are two event loops
provided, one for Linux based on epoll (aprinter/system/LinuxEventLoop.h) and
one that uses busy looping meant for microcontrollers
(aprinter/system/BusyEventLoop.h).

If you're going to write a TCP stack to see how it works, it's useful to log
all packets that don't advance the connection. This includes all rejected
packets, plus any duplicates or ACK-only packets that don't advance the
connection sequence. Examining the contents of the bit bucket is useful. I did
that in the early days of TCP, mostly to debug other implementations that had
interoperability trouble.

Yes people have the gumption to ask for numbers like that, and yes that's how
it works. What you described is a heavily abbreviated version, but it's pretty
much it.

Startup founders sit down with corp dev folks at a larger company.

They've had a dance with them before even setting foot onsite, now they'll
dance again in this meeting and similar meets for several months.

A number will be proposed to the founders by the corp dev folks after they've
done a fair bit of wooing, the founders can choose to push back or take it.
They'll hash out details of the acquisition, such as finances, logistics, long
term strategy, etc.

But long story short, yes, they ask for really high numbers. It's not so much
"gumption" as it is "you know what you're worth and you don't want to leave
money on the table."

So on a rather non-lethal note, I built a pair of robots for a predator/prey
sorts of experiments[1]. I had written code that used an R/C servo to locate a
beacon, and then navigate to the beacon. It worked quite well, but when I put
the beacon on the 'prey' robot it rarely worked at all. The challenge was the
added complexity of no fixed reference point. I found a great book[2] which
described a number of approaches to the problem and ended up using a pretty
simple pursuit model. The trick for me was tracking both the bearing to the
target and the bearing on loss of acquisition (so keeping track of "how" it
left the field of view) I ran out of CPU and memory before it got too
interesting but now I should revisit it as I've got 10x the CPU and memory to
play with.

[1] One thing about robots is once you get them doing the easy stuff you want
them to do harder stuff.

Software is rarely any better than it absolutely has to be for people to put
up with it, and these people _must_ put up with it. You need to find a
business case--either customers are defecting to other vendors, or fewer leads
are converting to customers, or time to market for new features is hurting
you, or good staff are resigning in disgust. If none of these things are true,
then sadly the business is actually making the right call, because terrible
software is cheaper and the market is all too willing to take it.

From your post it seems you're not quite ready to leave. So trying to share
your insights and raise awareness may be worth a shot. That is, if you can
comfortably speak with upper management without being singled out.

If the company is profitable and the users are pleased with the product then
from an upper management perspective there may not be anything wrong. Until
the bottom line is impacted there may not be leverage for change. The key is
to alert management to the state of the product and the course it's on.

Parallel development may be an option as the next release of the product would
address the underlying issues. This is costly and upper management would have
to understand why that's necessary.

\- Management is well aware that the software is problematic. I believe
they've been resting on their laurels for a while due to monopoly position.
Things are changing though; competitors are catching up.

they are forced to use it by our true customers: their bosses. Those higher-

Great commentary. Encoding high-level categorical variables as unordered
integers, or even frequency count maps, is pretty common practice, but really
only valid (as the author says) in tree based methods. Given deep enough trees
(or enough iterations in the boosting scenario), it is my anecdotal experience
that trees are able to parse out relevant values. The problem with indicator
variables in general is the enormous potential loss in computational time and
increase in complexity. My models have hundreds of vehicle/car types, U.S.
state, etc., and so this type of coding helps quite a bit in performance
without sacrificing (and sometimes improving due to curse-of-dimensionality)
model performance (IMHO YMMV)

------
hooande
I think the lesson here has been evident for some time: There is no one best
classifier, only classifiers that perform better on particular problems.
Random Forests work well because as ensemble methods they can be optimized to
explore many different aspects of a data set, but they don't perform
significantly better than SVMs or most of the other methods.

In practice the solution is often to _use a combination of multiple methods_.
Trees, support vector machines, multilayer perceptrons, gaussian kernels,
bagging and boosting. In most applications you don't have choose. Combining
the results of all of them together using a weighted average will out perform
any of them individually. And in most cases, the whole is greater than the sum
of its parts. Each classifier fits a given data set differently and provides
its own perspective on the prediction problem. The goal isn't to choose the
best one, but to find an ensemble of methods that best explain the patterns
and relationships in the data.

There are many cases where resource and speed limitations dictate that only
one classifier can be tuned and implemented, and in those situations it's good
to know which one is 'best'. But when it's possible to build an ensemble out
of many different methods it's almost always the best way to go.

I maintain that video is what made Flash ubiquitous, and thus enabled websites
to assume that visitors would have Flash installed.

HTML5 removes that advantage, so the installed base of Flash will decrease,
causing more and more sites to not develop for a Flash-audience.

So nominally, the post is right - HTML5 doesn't replace Flash. It renders
Flash obsolete.

Remember Shockwave? Also a browser-plugin, but only used for small niches,
games etc. Never had the ubiquity of Flash. This is where Flash is going after
HTML5.

"you will have to decide between using Flash with a 99.6% market penetration
or HTML5 with roughly less then 40% of users browsers"

Adobe keep rolling out the '99 percent' argument, and it is false. This
argument is essentially 'hey look, everybody is already running our
proprietary virtual machine so there is no need for a standards based
solution!'. If we all thought like that, there would never be any progress.

HTML5 is not a flash replacement, but HTML5 + CSS3 + Canvas + Javascript + SVG
+ new DOM etc. sure _is_

When most articles refer to HTML5, they are often refering to the combination
of new technologies, rather than the markup standard itself (ie. what was
initially 'Web Applications 1.0' from WHATWG).

melling
I think it is usually understood that when people say html5, they are
discussing the set of technologies that you mentioned, at least among
developers. Unless another buzzword arises, the term html5 is going to stick.
When the nyt or wsj write an html5 article, for example, do they really need
to explain the details to their readers?

A more scary thought is, what if we develop human-to-human transfer

inevitable that people in power will purchase young humans and transfer to

“Then I think it os inevitable that people in power will purchase young humans

Depending on how you see it, that already happens by having “a son who will
continue my deed”. People give a birth to people, pass down genes, knowledge,
viewpoints, behavioral patterns.

What you mean is probably that ‘self-aware thing’ that could teleport to a new
body. But in fact there is no teleportation, since there is no evidence of
such ‘thing’. You could make a fresh copy of your body (or a machine) and
maybe copy your brain contents to it, but you will not see from these new
eyes. Someone completely un-different will do. Because no soul; sensory gaps
define borders between us, your original eyes are still in place and your sad
brain is still there. Your copy will be happy that they are alive for yet
another century, but it is no different than when someone very similar is
already young and happy while you’re slowly decaying. Why not just tell them
all your stories and fade out then?

That brings us into the situation where dystopian nightmare already exists (it
ain’t me, it ain’t meee) and you’re doomed to live in your body no matter what
till the death.

Buy a wallet with conducting mesh (Faraday cage) or make a sleeve for your

Quick failure test it: by seeing if card still works on terminal when

I've carried a Datasafe wallet made by Kena Kai for ten years or so. It
includes a metallic mesh next to the leather that is durable enough that the
wallet is still in good shape. I have no idea how well the protection truly
works (it's marketed as complying with "FIPS-201 guidelines," which might not

This does not instill confidence. Hashes are not encryption. Furthermore there
is an enormous difference between "we store your password as a single round of
MD5" and "We use pbkdf2/scrypt to store your password".

~~~
gizmo686
My reading of that statement is that "Passwords are strongly encrypted" means
that they are stored securly such that the cannot be 'decrypted' even by
someone with access to the database. This phrase is intended for people
without crypto knowledge who would not know what a one-way hash is. The "using
a one-way hash" phrase is intended for people who do have this knowledge and
clarifies that they are actually using a hash function, and that the previous
statement was just a simplification for lay people.

It all depends on time, though it's unlikely I'll do a dossier on the EFF
unless something prompts it.

I will say broadly that their coverage of information sharing, surveillance
law, and intellectual property is rounded down to their specific issues and
narrow perspective - and these issues aren't necessarily one-for-one mappings
to "what's best for the internet/civility".

One example that comes to mind was their coverage of the recent Obama
Administration Executive Order 13694 [1][2] where they dropped the
international purpose and nature of the order entirely, as if the sanctions
weren't directed towards, and enforced by law, at actors in China and Russia
(and Iran and smaller players) overseas.

Following Snowden - who truly did show that the NSA was surveiling hundreds of
millions of Americans - the EFF's speculatory, alarmist and misleading
coverage of national cybersecurity and civil rights confused and angered a
confused and angry group of people we would rather have engaged in deliberate
and reasonable debate. Namely, despite how different in kind, scope, purpose
and method EO 13694 is, the EFF reported on it with the tone of the Snowden
disclosures and its audience associated the two.

I have spoken, too, with the EFF - and was disappointed both by their their
inability to use PGP (even after suggesting it to others) and the way they
engaged with the material I provided them. [I sent them evidence of a backdoor
in popular software and an analysis of a possible convenient backdoor location
for a popular hardware brand; they quietly acknowledged these reports but
AFAICT did nothing with them - as a comparison when I sent similar material,
using PGP, to cryptome they were immediately published.]

I should not have been so disappointed by what they did with the

Like all good ideas regarding electricity, Tesla already had it.

Tesla coils operate in reverse to turn high-voltage into high-current. This
was the base of Tesla's idea for wireless electricity. One Tesla coil can
deliver power through the air to another coil, however it typically only has a
fraction of the power of the input. However Tesla coils are capable of
receiving atmospheric electricity (lightning) and outputting current, however
only Tesla appeared interested in this.

A large enough Tesla coil could survive a lightning strike and produce huge
amounts of high voltage direct current, which is incidentally exactly what's
required for producing hydrogen.

It would be nice to see a company build a large tesla coil capable of
surviving lightning strikes to produce hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles.

My guess would simply be because the applications are limited in the West.
Europe would have no demand for the technology as yearly lightning strikes can
be less than .1/KM^2, while parts of the US can easily get to >50/KM^2. Lots
of Africa, and many parts of the southern hemisphere, can receive lightning
strikes of >200/KM^2 yearly.

Aside from the US and Australia, quite literally no technologically advanced
country gets lightning on the scale needed for this to have the great
potential it has. Even though much of Asia has high lightning strikes, China
and Japan have virtually none. Leaving just India who would have the means to
research something like this.

Honestly I believe the major problem is the current produced. A positive
lightning strike can hit at 300kA, and electrical discharged requires a
voltage of 3 million volts/meter traveled (IIRC a lightning bolt averages 100
million volts). This means to get it down to 110V, you're likely dealing with
~300 gigaAmperes. >60 Amps will allow you to weld 16 gauge steel wire. So you
would have to have enough conductive material to handle the flash-heating
produced by a surge of 300gA. This flash heating may, however, be productive

Obviously it is faster than grep... which is "linear search"! Compare it
instead to some "hashing search" to see how good or fast it really is. For
example, take SQLite's Full Text Search as reference.

Imho, there is no point in such a custom solution: it is too limited and too
simplified for real general uses.

~~~
LordHeini
Using some database backed full text search will beat this by a huge margin.

Especially when it comes to actually working correctly.

As the author states where are some caveats with invalid "hashes" and i
managed to get false negatives on the third try.

For example 'Baden-Württemberg' and 'Egypt' is in the file but not found by
the search.

Not to mention fuzzy search which is highly important if you are doing any
kind of text search.

And setting up some PostgresSQL or SQLite costs nothing compared to the cost
of debugging this rather naive approach.

~~~
peterburkimsher
Some queries (e.g. San Francisco) work on localhost but not Github, apparently
because of case-insensitive URLs. That's probably what's up with Egypt and
B-W.

A better hashing/binning algorithm should fix that.

I'd say it is normal. Generally you wouldn't find equations describing some
proposed model, instead you would find "equations" describing the statistical
observations. This paper, however, isn't empirical. It instead proposes a
theoretical framework, based on the earlier studies. It argues (hopefully
soundly) from the premises of the quoted studies to the conclusions it
reaches. The point of the research isn't to present this is exactly how this
behaves in mathematical terms, or even suggest a mathematical model for how it
could work. Instead it presents a semi-formal description of how it could
work, so someone can come up with an experiment trying to establish if it
really does work that way. Once some evidence is obtained, you go from there
to the more mathematical models.

Its hard to formalise things especially in fields were you're far removed from
the maths. So rather than spending a ton of time making a model that is
probably fundamentally wrong, you make an approximation in informal language.

Ads publishers treat us like a free resources that they can tap into. They
hire psychologist and sociologists to know the best way to trigger emotional
responses into us. They track our every move on the Internet. TV shows are
especially created to dumb us down and make us more receptive to the ad-break.
And ads are so omnipresent that they are virtually unavoidable. I don't
remember the last time I got convinced to buy by an ad but it must work since
they keep doing it.

So yes, I don't feel bad and ad-block the hell of everything and wish I could
do it in the real life too.

exposed. I need to know upfront how much of purchasing influence I'm expected
to spend on average otherwise how can I choose what is cheaper ?

~~~
bemmu
I am torn how I feel about ads.

It seems that they work for web and app publishers, because it's a way to
collect micropayments, while making people feel like they are not really
paying anything. Instead of asking someone to micropay you $0.001, you ask
them to waste brain cycles to tune out the ad + cause some increased chance
that they'll overpay for a brand name later. This might end up being more
expensive than the payment would have been.

I must admit I would behave the same way. If you gave me a way to pay $5 /
month that would be split among the sites I visit based on the pageviews I
generate, I probably would not do it. I wonder if there would a way for such a
system to be set up, so that it could offer something more than just
installing AdBlock would. I doubt it, but would be happy to be wrong.

It seems that ads are the only realistic way for this to work for publishers,
while adding an unfortunate mental tax for everyone not savvy enough to
install AdBlock. I hope one day we will come up with a solution.

I agree with much of the article. I think social media really damaged my view
on Millennials. I learned that when it came to social media people didn’t want
discuss their ideas. They don’t want a connection. They want to shout out
their beliefs and get a pat on the back. Criticism, even the least caustic, is
generally rolled into trolling. Don’t get me wrong there’s actual trolling and
real hate. I think there are people who can’t really discern between them well
enough.

He’s right about shoddy work presented as a final product. I’ve seen terrible
‘art’ pawned off as brilliance. I see people making themselves into
authorities without any exceptional works. There are people that want to be
gatekeepers/authorities to ideas and properties without ever paying their
dues. I remember growing up and thinking “How fortunate are we to live in a
time in which credentials could become meaningless?” Information is free. You
can learn to do anything. The problem is that there are people that bypass the
learning phase and somehow gain an army of support based on very little
knowledge of a subject (the food babe).

The thing that bothers me the most is that these people are surprised that
they are being criticized so much. They are wildly popular; they say something
that contradicts reality (often dangerously); they think that should go

That was an interesting read I agree and find that code names that rely on a
word that means a specific thing in a given field is really helpful as well.
For example with Neural Networks we extend the analogy that originated from a
graph/network into an image of the brain and add a new term and properties, so
when we add the term neuron we can give it the property that behaves like it
does from the field it originated from such as being able to fire. This
creates a wonderful mental model that not only explains the purpose of the
algorithm to "learn" much like brains do, but also serves as a way for people
to remember, much like a pneumonic device, all the different pieces that go
along with the algorithm.

I also find trying to draw analogies from different fields can lead to new
discoveries for yourself and others. In the case of the neural network maybe
the person who invented it said, what would it look like if we were to model
the human brain in a computer? Obviously the intent there would be for your
model to function as a human brain. You could always do it the other way
around and start with an existing model and say what properties could I add or
remove to this system to make it perform a different and interesting function?
If I add this new property does it make it a different enough function that I
have to change the underlying analogy? I think if you ask the right questions
and seek their answers then this is one way in which you can evolve ideas.
Also this way of stating different disparate ideas and evolving them is a good
teaching method. For example I was once explained that a binary search tree
with all items inserted in order was just a fancily decorated linked list, and
though kind of silly it gave me an aha moment and connected the two more
deeply in my mind.

One thing that I would love to see from these diagram tools is to have the
different components be aware of which other components can be connected too
and how they will interact.

I think that will create a set of new features and possibilities for the
tools.

For example don’t allow an nginx component to be connected to a MySQL
server(not sure if it’s possible though, you get the point) or require a load
balancer when a browser wants to connect to multiple nodes, etc, that kind of
logic.

That can then be expanded into having it suggesting architecture patterns or
even generating definition files for you.

Just an idea

Visio does this. It's really a shame that Visio's SVG renderer is so bad,
since its PDF and raster output is really good. But SVG is the standard now,

The Cloud and Open Source Powder Keg - tdurden

This article perpetuates the myth that Amazon forked Elasticsearch. They did
not; not even close. The website they published links to a github organization
that hosts a lot of repositories, all of which are plugins. They simply use
the OSS builds that you can 1) produce with the official build scripts in
Elasticsearch 2) That Elasticsearch actively publishes on their website in RPM
and Docker form. The readme's for said plugins instruct you to download these!
Sure, they make you look for it but still. The key premise that they don't do
that is simply not true. And yes their repository contains clearly documented
code that is a mix of several licenses. This is not confusing at all as it
cannot be for legal reasons. The license file, which is very short, explains
this.

What Amazon did do is replicate some of the functionality Elastic has in their
proprietary code base in the form of plugins and open sourced that. Very nice
of them and completely fine of course. But I'd like to point out that they are
not very actively contributing to Elasticsearch directly and fully dependent
on Elastic (and others) continuing to do the R&D for them. Elastic meanwhile
continues to distribute the core of their product under the very permissive
Apache 2.0 license, which allows Amazon to do this and which Elastic is fully
committed to continuing to use. Meanwhile they ship a lot of their added value
as non OSS software, which means their business is not that much threatened by
the mediocre ripoff by Amazon. Some of that is actually freely usable; some of
that indeed requires a commercial license. Likewise, Amazon ships OSS (like
Elastic) and proprietary stuff but makes their money from hosting stuff rather
than licensing it. Elastic does the same with Elastic cloud.

In doing so, they are going against the trend at e.g. MongoDB of using a very
restrictive OSS license that pretty much requires a commercial license in most
corporate environments and is also problematic for commercial partners to
contribute to. Apache 2.0

I'm currently struggling with dealing with shared libraries at work. I think
the challenge is that the whole concept of dev-ops is fairly new[1], and from
my experience Java, .Net, Python, etc. weren't designed for easy management of
versioned dependencies. You have tools like Maven, Nuget, and Pip that pop up
because it's a real problem, but they're add-ons to the ecosystem rather than
built-in at a foundational level. And more to the point, if you want to set up
your own package server[2], it can be a huge effort to integrate it into your
build process[3].

The more I learn about history, and see how things like tribalism were the
driving factor in many decisions, the more I see the same in our current
world. I'm not going to get into politics, but: We have a tendency to look
into the past and think "How did those crazy people ever behave that way?!?"
and then turn around and do the same exact thing "But our world is different!
Our enemies really are the bad guys this time!"

We really are just a group of big, technologically advanced tribes, fighting
for perceived scarcity of resources. The scariest thing about learning history
just how much nothing changes.

~~~
ktRolster
_The scariest thing about learning history just how much nothing changes._

It's changed a _lot._ Several thousand years ago, we realized that having a
king solves a lot of problems, such as tribal warfare, and squabbles between
small groups of people. Pax Romana it might be called, although it was found
on a smaller scale before that.

The Greeks appreciated the power of a monarch, but didn't like to be told what
to do, and their emphasis on individual freedom eventually led to democracy
like the Roman senate. Unfortunately, the roman senate couldn't handle
changing demographics very well, and became indolent, corrupt, and useless, so
a dictator was an improvement.

Throughout the middle ages, philosophers put a lot of thought into the idea
of, "How to find the best monarch?"

Eventually the United States came up with an idea of how to balance the power
of state with individual freedom, and put some procedures in place to handle
demographic changes, learning from the Roman's failures.

Learning takes centuries, but it definitely happens. The improvements to the
legal system since Sumerian times is notable as well.

No, no password for any of the so called "insurance files" was ever released,
as far as I know and can google. All I can find are recent (2019, 2020)
articles talking about the files and how no password was ever revealed.

Relatedly, Assange described the files not as "dead man switches" to be
unleashed in case of his arrest, extradition, killing as the media liked to
portrait it, but instead said that the insurance files contained (unredacted)
data that wikileaks intended/intents to release later anyway, in redacted
form, and that the encrypted unredacted data was put online to be backups if
wikileaks lost the data e.g. due to a raid. The remains of wikileaks activists
could then recover the files from the torrents or other people who downloaded
the torrents, and could decrypt them to get the data back (but wouldn't
release the password into the wild).

Philosophic Taoism introduces Dao, the origin and derivatives of the essence
of nature, its laws and forms, on top of which the Taoist religion developed a
complete methodology for normal people to ascend into heaven by practicing
introductory transcending courses and eating natural/artificial elixirs.

The ultimate stage of ascended beings will be Tao itself, the advanced stage
is celestial being, and the intermediate stage is god, and the beginning stage
is 'trueman'.

Celestial beings have freedom to create new rules/universes with certain
backfiring possibility which may cease their own existence. Normally they
don't care about earth and human beings except for promoting new gods. Gods
are anthropomorphic and every one has a job. They either enforce specific
rules or govern certain domains to maintain the human world. Truemen are long
lived human beings and they can self-educate themselves ascending to be new
gods or destroyed by Tao if they fail to purify themselves.

Therefore, Taoism has two ways of creating anthropomorphic gods:
promoted/guided by Celestial beings or self-help to ascend.

The first way is for great inventors and heroes etc. The second way is for
Taoist priests and emperors, but neither of them succeeded.

LoL

In China history, many famous emperors were poisoned by mercury because Taoist
alchemists believed it's an essential ingredient for any elixir (on purpose?)

\- How can we deploy docker hub images (for cases where the image is built by

that hides the files on the repo homepage. :)

almarklein
Thanks, I will update the readme to include more info.

To answer some: It pushes a zipped directory to the server, which includes a
Dockerfile. There, the server builds the image and deploys it.

Deploying pre-build images is probably best done by using a Dockerfile that
uses FROM to point to the pre-build image.

I'm slightly more amused: I have a 3G in my pocket whose headphone jack has
literally caved in on itself from overwear (from a big 1/4" -> 1/8" adapter

side for sound to work—and yet I still consider this to be a pretty damn nice

I supposedly have unlimited data from Verizon on the Android phone I have. I'm
actually surprised at how little I've been able to use in a month (my max has
been 2-3 GB). I don't watch a lot of videos, but I stream a fair bit of music
and browse the web frequently, making use of wifi when possible.

I think this works like shared hosting. Many people think they need unlimited
bandwidth, and it sounds great, but they end up using far less than expected.
This more than makes up for the people who use excessive amounts.

~~~
michaelbuckbee
To a great extent I think it's just the "no surprises" aspect of having
unlimited bandwidth as well as the not having to pay the cost of your time in
monitoring, worrying am I using too much and all that.

I only recently did the math with my phone and figured out that I could save a
chunk every month by downgrading from the unlimited plan and actually using
the WiFi in my house.

Ask YC: What "problem" does Facebook solve? - bosshog

I have found it hard to give a great answer to this, "Keeping in touch" seems kinda meh.
======
run4yourlives
I think FB did exactly that for the college crowd, and considering that crowd
tends to have many loose connections, it solved a huge need for them -
figuring out what everyone was up to.

Once they launched to the world at large, many people enjoyed connecting with
people that had been in their lives previously like some big high school
reunion. This is still the first thing that attracts a new user to fb.

The problem I see is, without a constant need to stay in touch (i.e. who's
doing what, who's going where this week), it really has no purpose. Once I've
seen what my buddy in grade 2 is up to now, and who my first girlfriend
married, I don't really need to know anything else.

Hence: Applications. FB apps are the solution looking for a problem. In many
cases, the app itself is what people like to use. For instance, scrabulous is
pretty popular with my wife. The problem is that for someone like me, all the
apps do is annoy the hell out of me, and make me less likely to use fb.

I've seen more than a few friends suddenly drop off fb. I suspect the trend to
continue.

~~~
brlewis
After they drop off fb, how do they keep in touch, or do they?

~~~
run4yourlives
If they're my friends, I already have their emails, phone numbers etc.

If they're somebody I knew from my past, they don't. Because outside of a two
minute catch-up when we first discovered each other on fb, we haven't said
anything to each other anyway.

Oddly, the historically developed magnitude scale (which goes back to the
ancient Greek astronomers) has the brightest objects ranked with magnitudes
that are negative numbers, and dimmer objects ranked with increasing numbers
that eventually become positive numbers. Of course the estimate of eventual
brightness of the newly discovered comet is just that, an estimate, and may
disappoint.

FYI the Greeks didn't have negative numbers. Philosophers were still arguing

When I was five or so, my dad got excited one day and said there would be a
comic in the sky and we would go see it that night. I thought that was pretty
cool, and I thought about how they were going to set it up.

I'd seen searchlights many times used for advertising where you could see the
beam hit the bottom of an overcast, and I figured they had a way to use one of
those to actually project a comic up onto the cloud cover.

After dark, we drove out of town up to a hilltop. I was puzzled: it was a
perfectly clear night, so what were they going to project the comic onto?

Then he pointed and said, "There it is!"

But it was no comic, it was just a little star with a fuzzy tail.

Storj Crowdsale - trundlingtrain

======
Taek
Why does storj need 6 million dollars? What are they planning on doing with
it?

One problem with Storj is that their technical contributions to the field have
been very minimal, the best I can tell is that they've introduced
'BitCumulis', which is a 'modular' design for integrating multiple solutions
such as those presented in MaidSAFE and ethereum. They haven't actually made
any convincing contributions to the bigger problems.

From what I can tell, storj is a front-end that is waiting for other teams to
solve their proof of storage and proof of bandwidth problems. And I don't
understand how that calls for 9800 BTC.

~~~
tinkerrr
For those who don't know about the MaidSAFE project, The Whitepaper (a good

[https://github.com/maidsafe/Whitepapers/blob/master/Project-...](https://github.com/maidsafe/Whitepapers/blob/master/Project-
Safe.md) here's their code:
[https://github.com/maidsafe](https://github.com/maidsafe) This project is
something that's quite interesting in its scope. It goes to see how successful
they'll be in implementing all of this, and how robust the system would turn
out (e.g. would someone lose data if 10% of the network magically disappears
overnight)

walden42
IMO this deserves a lot more attention than storj. It's everything storj has,
plus a whole decentralized internet infrastructure upon which other
decentralized applications can be built. It seems the most logical way

I'm working on a highly distributed coop cloud built with OpenStack and
Bitcoin: [https://www.stackmonkey.com/](https://www.stackmonkey.com/). The
appliance is in beta as of yesterday, but the site is still in progress.

I'm at a slightly different layer

That's significant because water ice is an extremely useful resource in
colonization of the Solar System. It can be harvested for potable water, of
course, but it can also be cracked into Oxygen and Hydrogen, for breathing and
use as a rocket fuel.

That last is extremely important because of the rocket equation. The amount of
propellant (fueled mass / empty mass) you need to accelerate a rocket to a
specific velocity (delta V) scales exponentially with the ratio of that
velocity to the rocket's exhaust velocity. Staging lets you stretch this harsh
restriction by throwing away parts of your vehicle so that you can clean the
slate and get to a better mass ratio for the next stage. But staging is still
exponentially costly, just more efficiently so.

Now, if you look at the very end point of a trip to the Moon and back you have
a vehicle launching from the lunar surface and then (the same or another
vehicle) transferring to a return trajectory to Earth. These maneuvers take a
sizable amount of propellant (especially launching from the surface). The
weight of that propellant needs to be gently landed on the surface of the
Moon, which costs extra propellant. Further, the return propellant plus its
corresponding proportion of the landing propellant needs to be boosted from
Earth orbit to the Moon, which costs further propellant. Etc, etc, all the way
down to the launch vehicle(s) on Earth. As you see, the return propellant
imposes an escalating parasitic cost throughout the whole trip. If, instead of
the above, you were able to pilot a mostly empty vehicle to the Moon's surface
where it would fuel up with Liquid Oxygen and Liquid Hydrogen manufactured by
mining and processing lunar water ice then you would be able to cut out that
whole huge chunk of extra weight and propellant needed to get to the Moon and
back.

Which means, you could travel to the Moon and back with much lower Earth bound
mission mass, which means you can use smaller launch vehicles, which means you
can get to the Moon cheaper and easier.

Not to mention, of course, that supplies of water make maintaining a mostly
self-sufficient lunar base much, much easier.

------
Aron
I would think it cheaper to send 32 ounces of water from Earth to the moon in
a Dasani bottle,

There are significant constraints around what can be built. They change over
time, and in fact, finding ideas that were rejected for being too hard in the
past can be a good indicator of something that could be built now.

And many great business ideas that solve huge problems with clear distribution
channels can fail, because the solution that works isn't possible or feasible
to build yet.

Yeah, standard cupcake. But what I always found puzzling about
entrepreneurs/SMB owners who write things like this is, how do you then go out
and convince other people to work for you? Are you bullshitting candidates
while actually looking down on them as tools that are stupid enough to "work
for your dream" or have "forgotten they had dreams of their own"?

~~~
yariang
Why is this puzzling? I doubt any entrepreneur thinks _everyone_ should do
their own business. If that was the case the world would be made of companies
of one person and nothing would ever get accomplished.

The mindset of an entrepreneur is very peculiar and is not representative of
the average person (if such person existed). Most people don't _want_ the
stress and pains that come with having your own business; they are happy with
a regular job. Therefore, you're not cheating someone who desires the
stability and guidance of a job by getting them to work for you. Just because
the OP can't stand the thought of working for someone else doesn't mean he
thinks everyone must feel that way.

So I don't see where the confusion comes from?

Rubbish. Stuff like e.g. boats in the multi-tonne weight class are secured by
tying knots every day. Spearfishers. Mountain climbers. I could go on.

Get some 2 mm Dyneema rope, which has an average breaking strength of 300 kg,
run it through some D-rings and tie it with an Alpine Butterfly. You will be
able to do pullups off that artwork if you want.

~~~
abakker
This all depends on what you're hanging. If hanging art worth more than $100,
use steel cable. Museums and galleries all use steel cable because it is
easier and nicer to work with. dyneema is strong, but not chemically stable
and will degrade over time with exposure to atmosphere and light (though
obviously there isn't a lot of light behind a piece of art on the wall).

~~~
semi-extrinsic
I agree that it's easier to work with - you don't need to know any knots, just
twist it and it stays. So that's a definite benefit.

But when it comes to UV and chemical resistance, I don't see how one would get
any degradation in a museum setting. Dyneema is used in heavy industrial
applications like mooring lines and tugboats for very large ships with
lifespans over ten years. Unless you're hanging up something that you're not
taking down for a century, it shouldn't be a worry.

I've been on two interviews recently, and both saw experience in .NET as a
negative. I found myself having to down-play experience in .NET in both cases,
in order to guide the discussion toward more applicable skills for the role.
Even when you may be a polyglot programmer, interviewers tend to label you as
.NET or Microsoft. Which, has apparently become a bad thing. Unless you're
interviewing with a Fortune-100 company, in which case, .NET is still somewhat
popular.

Author states "Using the Disruptor (a lock-free ring buffer on the JVM), you
can easily process 20M+ events per second. On .NET using ordained "best
practices" anything more than a dozen transactions per second is considered
decent-to-good performance and at that point, you just need bigger/better/more
hardware."

WTF? This is inane.

~~~
cachemiss
Yeah, he's comparing one of the best optimized ring buffers on the JVM to
actual transactions, that's one of the worst comparisons I've ever seen. I've
shipped large scale systems on .NET and on the JVM, the issues you run into
with .NET are that windows isn't as easy to administer IMO as linux variants,
and your ecosystem isn't as strong, that's about it.

.NET doesn't have a runtime profiler that will deoptimize / recompile etc.,
which can cause slowdowns in certain use cases, it does have a better unsafe
story, and value types, and reified generics which can make things faster for
you.

This 'cultural' matching process is _the_ most important element of having
anyone join your business - investors, board members, staff, even clients if
your business involves ongoing interaction with them.

I like to think of the 'have a beer with' as having the 'family photo fit' -
if you can't picture this person fitting into a photo of your business family,
then you don't want to work with them. _Especially_ if they are bringing money
you need, because personal differences will painfully divide the business.

On the internet, there are few barriers to entry. It's incredibly cheap and

The fact that there are fewer barriers to entry also make startups where there

I've dealt with deploying Java apps in-container, as .war files, and it has
invariably been painful. Deployment to a new server requires installing the
container first. Then configuring it, an excruciating process of editing many
XML files. Configuration management for production, staging, QA, and
development environments almost immediately becomes a whole separate set of
fragile programs and scripts.

I have found it much easier to treat the main app as just a piece of software
that happens to interact with the rest of the world using HTTP. Deployment
becomes trivial; it really just needs a startup script and a directory of .jar
files (dependency libraries) and another .jar or directory of .class files for
your actual application. Installing on a new server doesn't require much more
than a pre-installed JVM.

Out of curiosity, what value does deploying in a container add for you?

In no way am I trying to be enterprisey (although if we do end up selling this

deployment across multiple nodes. In that context, the (re)deployment
facilities provided by any container beats coordinating things on the command

deployed as a WAR...

Last winter wasn't. We barely had the heating on at all. Year before wasn't
that bad.

I always find the people who care a lot about the weather to be rather idle-
minded. Unless your main intellectual past time is playing golf i'm not sure
how it can affect you. If you are busy doing something awesome the last thing
you are going to care about is the rain.

JonoBB
What a pejorative statement. If those awesome things involve being outdoors,
then you care a lot about the weather. If you grew up in a country with an
outdoors lifestyle, expect that to be severely curtailed when you come to
London (or the UK for that matter). If you have kids, expect them to be
playing indoors for a disproportionate amount of time.

For someone who grew up in a much sunnier climate (South Africa), it can be
crushingly oppressive at times.

~~~
easytiger
I grew up in one of the rainier and colder parts of the British Isles and I
don't recall any such issues with playing outside. Sure I had to wear wellies
when playing in the fields or local common green areas but I don't recall it
restricting whatever it was I was doing. Perhaps it is the modern need to have
adults oversee everything a child does which actually causes the restriction.
I'd expect most children couldn't care less about the rain and bad weather.

Also I visit South Africa 4-5 times a year and I don't notice my daily routine
change much from London apart from driving more. If anything I walk less
because it is too hot around Dec-Feb. Indeed I'd be pretty worried about
letting kids out for long periods in such unrelenting sunshine.

Oh, so then the weather matters after all. Apparently it matters so much that
it has affected the whole work-hour traditions of Spain. Huh.

"Weather" can be pointless wringing, and it can also be complaints from people

Pedro essentially highlights the fact that different cultures are taking
different political, academic and commercial approaches to the space.

I found some of his comments insightful: _If you think about it, democracy is
still in the 19th century. Your communication with your representatives and
ministers amounts to a few bits per year. It 's ridiculous._ and _Just like
Americans believe in lawyers, the Chinese believe in engineers_. However, I
resent the needlessly antagonistic us-and-them closing paragraph, which is not
constructive. In Buddhism it is said that "right speech" unites people instead
of dividing them, and the conclusion to the "scary technology" article
transfers the scary to China and is fundamentally divisive.

Back in the real world, as a nominal German starting an AI-backed startup in
China, I also found it refreshing and healthy that he can directly criticize
Germany for its cultural conservatism in a widely read German publication. We
don't see much of that in Australia, New Zealand or China, all of whom, I
would argue, consider themselves as a culture significantly less homogenous
and conservative than they really are.

Perhaps the world is a far more nuanced place than any of its commentators can
fathom, or to quote another German - Einstein (speaking perhaps prophetically
for 20th century humanity on the cusp of the self-styled information era):
_The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don 't know_.

I don't quite understand the sudden optimism around the feasibility of strong
AI. The only major advancement in the last two decades seems to be neural nets
in pattern recognition. Before deep learning, pattern recognition wasn't even
considered proper AI. The other advancements seem to be just based on better
compute and not a new revolutionary idea.

I hope people also get to hear from researchers on the other side of the
argument (like Michael Jordan): the real risk is not super-intelligent AI
destroying human race, but stupid AI being handed over control of critical
aspects of our daily lives.

So based on what you said (since I really have pretty much no knowledge of my
own) this sort of thing MIGHT be a good idea because they are indicating that
the users would just see what trades other people are making. In a comment
further down they mentioned that "The data would be entirely made up of
trades, no opinions, comments and noise". If that's the case and there is some
kind of disclaimer saying that nothing is investment advice, then no one would
be liable right? Or am I oversimplifying?

I guess the only other thing I would worry about would be ending up trying to
learn from someone who has as little experience as I do.

I love this visualization - but I think there's a very different intuition you
get from PCA in high dimensions.

I prefer to think of the singular vectors in PCA as an ordering of "prototype
signals" for which some linear combination best reconstructs the data. That
explains, for example, why the largest singular vectors on natural time series
data gives fourier like coefficients, and why the largest singular vectors on
aligned faces gives variations in lighting.

society can be corrupt or fall to pieces. The wars we have had in recent years

this reason we need to be discussing the climate without using the 'rights'

My takeaway is that the paper's intended goal is to explain a neat, perhaps
practical, way to emulate some qubits. It doesn't do anything "magical", it
encodes all of the amplitudes into the signal (in a real quantum computer,
you'd have no direct access to the amplitudes) and explains how to emulate

This is something that has been noticed before mathematically, but hard to do
in practice. The article is maybe a little confused. The limitation on size
comes from the limit on frequency/amplitude resolution - for a given scale and
resolution, the need to distinguish states grows combinatorially. It can be
overcome by making the system smaller. Eventually you can rely on quantum
effects to help, when you are no longer emulating a quantum system, you've
basically built one.

Well, you could distribute your _encrypted_ wallet as widely as you want,
without worrying about theft or loss (if you have a good passphrase and spread

The point of using the Pi is that you can make sure the _decrypted_ wallet
data only ever exists for a short time in RAM on hardware that is very likely
non-malicious and that never has and never will connect to the Internet. If I
had a significant amount of bitcoins sitting in an address that was generated

not the other way around. Previously, our algorithms wouldn't understand the
importance of this connection, and we returned results about U.S. citizens
traveling to Brazil. With BERT, Search is able to grasp this nuance and know
that the very common word “to” actually matters a lot here, and we can provide
a much more relevant result for this query."

> _... people were willing to pay for an a set of partially broken dishes if

I think this is similar to what is described by Dan Ariely in his book,
_Predictably Irrational_ , as the Decoy Effect. Relevant excerpt from
Wikipedia [1]:

"People not only compare things, but also compare things that are easily
comparable. For example, if given the following options for a honeymoon -
Paris (with free breakfast), Rome (with free breakfast), and Rome (no
breakfast included), most people would probably choose Rome with the free
breakfast. The rationale is that it is easier to compare the two options for
Rome than it is to compare Paris and Rome. Ariely also explains the role of
the decoy effect (or asymmetric dominance effect) in the decision process. The
decoy effect is the phenomenon whereby consumers will tend to have a specific
change in preference between two options when also presented with a third
option that is asymmetrically dominated. This effect is the "secret agent" in
many decisions."

In your case the third choice - email - is the decoy or secret agent - making
the other two options more attractive for ease of use.

# of days since the last alg=none JWT vulnerability - tosh
https://www.howmanydayssinceajwtalgnonevuln.com
======
gavinray
This exact vulnerability is something I've seen in a good number of open-
source codebases or boilerplate repos in the Node ecosystem.

The library most people use for JWT stuff in Node is Auth0's. There are two
methods for decoding a token payload: jwt.decode() and jwt.verify()

Both of them return the decoded payload, but one (if you don't read the
documentation) sounds more immediately like the one you think you want to use.

jwt.decode() doesn't verify the token when decoding:

[https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken#jwtdecodetoken--
o...](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken#jwtdecodetoken--options)

If you dig through Node repos on Github searching for "jwt.decode()" or
"this.jwtService.decode()" you'll see a shocking number of results.

The other big mistake I've seen is encoding personal data in the token,
instead of just an ID that only has meaning inside of your database. It turns
out not everyone is aware that JWT tokens are publicly decodable and that the
only security is in the signing + verification. Many people I've spoke with
think the token is like a hash.

~~~
hinkley
I worked on some code signing code, and one of the internal customers, who had
a lot of clout (but not as much as they thought) were adamant that I needed to
provide them a way to pluck data out of the payload without verifying the
signature first. I told them, in a variety of extremely diplomatic ways, to
politely fuck off. In fact I did a sweep of the code to make extra sure that
none of the data paths gave you anything before verification had finished
(there were not barn doors but there were soft spots). When your dog is
sniffing around, it's time to hide the treats.

The only reason you want to look at a payload is to make decisions about it,
_before you can trust those decisions are rational_. What I did promise them
is that

I wonder how the rate of covering by snow compares with blown bulbs needing
replaced, as both result in the lights not being visible. (Though I'm guessing
it's more likely for more than one light to be obscured by snow than to be
blown, which might makes things worse (or better?))

In areas where there is little or no snow then this would be an (un?)expected
benefit of the change to more efficient lights.

Same thing with halogen vs xenon car lights. One of the reasons xenon kits are
illegal in many countries, they lack wipers and xenon lights can't melt snow
(they usually also lack lenses, hence they dazzle other drivers).

imrehg
Accidents are terrible things, but I'm not exactly sure why to blame those
traffic accidents on the lights instead of the drivers. First rule: drive as
the driving conditions permit. Had it been a power-cut or a mist (making the
traffic lights similarly unusable), would people still blame the lights if
someone crashes their car? Unintended: sure. Hazard: quite possibly. Driving
carefully: priceless...

epochwolf
If you can't see the lights you can misread the signals. I live in Green Bay,
WI and I saw most of the lights along my morning route to school were covered
on north/south lanes but clear on east/west. It was very very difficult to
determine what light I had even using the east/west lights to rule out them
having a green light. I had several close calls. Additional in Green Bay
visibility was quite poor and the roads were dangerous.

As for people missing the signals, I have a theory. Everyone I know determines
if they have a red, yellow, or green light by looking at the color of the
light. (Bear with me here.) I look at the position of the light instead of the
color. I am the only person I know with normal vision that does this. From the
number of people I've asked, only those with colorblindness read lights by
position. I would assume this means most people look for a light to find a
stoplight. Given poor visibility the lack of a visible light means people
won't see the signal.

I've tried to model the REPL environment of murex more on what tooling I'd
expect from an IDE rather than what tooling I'd expect from a POSIX shell.
That's not to say I've created a polished UI/UX nor that there isn't some
Bash/zsh features missing from murex. There's still someway to go before murex
will be out of it's beta stage. But that's the design inspiration behind the

What is that typeface? Every vowel looks like an "o" that was cut up to look
like another vowel, its absolutely hard to read. It's also ironic that there's
(allegedly) a focus on readability for the language but absolutely none of
that concern found its way to the website.

I do like the piping syntax.

Thanks for the feedback. I'm dyslexic so I did actually spend a long time
picking a readable typeface for the website since I often struggle with some
of the artistic choices other designers inflict. I found this typeface (and
the other stylings of the site) to be what was easiest for me to read.

However I do acknowledge that I haven't conducted any form of research into
other people's opinions and nor have I tested the site on many other platforms
aside Firefox and Safari. So what works for me might not work for other
people.

To that end, if others agree it's not the most readable typeface (or any other
issues with the site are pointed out) then I will definitely change it. As you
rightly say, being readable is the most important concern for that site.

For all of NASA’s faults, realistic practicing emergencies in a simulator is
something they get right. The crew have already started this process with the
Dragon, and will have been pressing these buttons while dressed for space and
in the middle of simulated emergencies.

(Fun fact, the buttons in the Soyuz capsule are currently operated with a
astronaut held stick during launch and landing.

Very interesting.

The only odd part is that the modules (drivers) themselves are not referenced
by URL, but only by a simple word (in the example "port_io").

Also, I wonder how we could combine drivers. For example, (theoretically)
instead of using "https" as driver, we could compose it as "HTTP over TLS over
TCP", and change any of those subcomponents as desired. With URLs this might
become clumsy.

It depends how you want to express the hierarchy - URLs say "this is my
transport system, and this is my address".

But you could propose doing:

The problem is that "tech journalists" tend to actually be business
journalists. They aren't investigative journalists looking to uncover the
workings and untrue assumptions of society increasingly dependent on tech.
Most of them do just want to cover new companies & new products & other
business news. Many of them invest in those very companies or have spouses in
that business community. Yes it is a problem the way tech covers Apple
compared to the way tech covers NSA. But what it reveals is that tech
journalists aren't the type of journalists we need (definitely not journalists
in the 4th branch of government sense) and that investigative journalists need
to learn more about tech.

JVIDEL
Are there any non-business journalists left? last time I checked CNN had no
war correspondents anymore and most news sites have turned into gossip rags

care about the wrongdoings of the industry and because no pageviews=no money
then nobody runs the story.

Yes! Someone finally said it. The worst are the operators. You don't need
these libraries and their lack of tests.

Noticed this might be an ad about a book... Parsing JSON in Swift. The bubble
is real. What developer would buy this? What's next, a book about
NSURLSession?

jtbrown
Wait... who told you I was writing that book? Just wait till you read next

------
mpweiher
And here's your regularly scheduled announcement that the actual _JSON
parsing_ is done by the library call
NSJSONSerialization.JSONObjectWithData(...) in line 3 of the code.

The rest is just getting the parsed data out of already parsed nested
dictionaries and arrays in a way that makes the type checker happy. Calling
that "parsing" is probably the biggest myth of them all (though agreed about
all the other myths).

~~~
efaref
True. Although the Android JsonReader class does force you to write your own
parser (it is itself merely a lexer). This is really inelegant.

What I'd really like is a way to write my POD types as normal:

    
    
      class Foo {
        int bar;
        String baz;
        ArrayList<String> blah;
        ArrayList<Xyz> xyzs;
      }
    
      class Xyz
      {
        String name;
        int value;
      }
    

And then just write this to parse it all.

    
    
      ...
      Parser<Foo> p = new Parser<Foo>();
      Foo f;
      try {
        f = gp.parse(input);
      } catch (JsonParseException e) {
        ...
      }
    

I'd be willing to accept having to annotate some of the fields, (but other
than that, this should be possible to do).

It says: " To sign a message, encrypt it with the private key To verify a
signature, decrypt it with the public key and make sure it matches the
message"

This is only half true for one algorithm: RSA. But even there it's only true
for something called "Textbook RSA", which is an insecure variant of RSA
nobody should be using. It's not true for any real algorithm.

I'm really not a fan of such sloppy "I want to explain it easy" crypto
introductions that are simply not correct.

(Also found it odd that he uses "Verisign" as an example for a CA. Verisign
has been bought by Symantec and Symantec was distrusted by browsers recently,
so it's as dead as it can be.)

I presume what you're saying is that there is a whole set of missing
verification additions, but if not, what are you referring to for textbook RSA
being insecure?

~~~
tialaramex
You need to "pad" the number that will be signed so that it's the right size
and shape to fit, or else bad guys can choose for you to sign a number that
makes it very easy to find your private key by looking at the signature which
is clearly a terrible outcome.

Remember RSA is just very simple maths, done with huge numbers. If you pick
the right "huge" numbers things that look hard become very easy indeed. So we
need to ensure we never pick them.

The correct way to do this, which a lot of systems haven't adopted yet, is
called RSA-PSS, the Probabilistic Signature Scheme. PSS has a proof that says
if you believe RSA works, and assume certain other reasonable things, this is
actually safe.

Before RSA-PSS (and still today in lots of backwards compatible systems),
people used PKCS#1 v1.5 which has a scheme somebody threw together to do some
padding but without any great insight. There is no security proof for PKCS#1
v1.5, it's probably safe, ish, but we can't be sure.

totally filled, but it's also not, because memories and feelings like

I've noticed in recent years that I really cannot parse out quick cuts in
movies anymore. For example, I have a very hard time following action
sequences in the Marvel movies, and the Transformers movies were just a jumble
to me. I mostly don't even bother with trying to watch movies anymore.

I'm probably just getting old...

~~~
moskie
These action sequences being a jumbled up mess is a feature, I think. It
allows the action on-screen to be visually sloppy and imprecise (thus easier
to make), and the audience makes up for it (subconsciously) with their
imagination filling in the imperfections with something even better than what
they could put on film.

At least, that's what I tell myself. Perhaps we're both just getting old.

~~~
MAGZine
You're exactly right. Not only is the ASL (average shot length) decreasing
over time _, but flurries of quick shots are great for hiding action that
doesn 't actually happen. It's definitely can be used as a crutch. Not always,
it can accelerate the feeling of action, but often feels lazy, and a
disservice to the viewer.

_e.g. Citizen Kane had an ASL of 12 seconds. Transformers: Dark side of the
moon? 3.4seconds!

Why do so many people have such trouble with this simple concept?

Git isn't complicated, you just have to understand that a git repository is
composed of two things:

1) The _index_ which is the git information about all your files (ie. .git/)

2) The files you currently have checked out.

When you git fetch, you update the index, nothing else.

When you git merge or git rebase or reset or checkout, you update your _files_
from _the index_.

-____-

It makes me extremely sad to see this repeated over and over and people don't
get it.

~~~
tednaleid
The index isn't the information on all your files (it's not the .git
directory). The index is an intermediate holding location between the file
system and actually storing all of those files as a commit in the commit tree.
It's the current state of the proposed next commit.

Your description misses (or conflates) an entire tree of information (the HEAD
tree), and it's arguably the most important one as it holds the whole of your
git repo's history.

I didn't fully understand git till I read Scott Chacon's "A Tale of 3 Trees"
which explains what reset is all about and goes into the details: <http://git-
scm.com/blog/2011/07/11/reset.html>

I love git, but I do not think it's obvious or intuitive without some
explanation. It's different than any other SCM I've used in the past. I
created this presentation a while ago that I think highlights some of the real
concepts that people need to know to really understand git:

It is in Google‘s interest to generally retain a maximum possible number of

basically not doing that much. The main thing is that you stay put and don’t

I like it so far, for the most part. Especially that you can quickly switch
between the article and the comments, which in normal browsers I'd even a
hassle on the desktop. If we some day get the ability to content as well ...
:)

Not to much of a fan of the colored bars for nested comments, shades of the
same color (we already have an accent color on WP) might be nicer. Might also
be nicer to people who are colorblind.

The address/toolbar below the article feels more like Android than WP. On WP
you usually get an explanation of icons in the toolbar when stopping up
because their captions are right underneath the low end of the screen. Took me
a while to figure out what the icons meant which IMHO isn't that great UX.
Also a reason why I like the toolbar design on WP, because it's compact and
supports labels if the user needs them. Not sure how to incorporate the usual
toolbar design into the current workings of the app, though.

When tapping the '...' button the animation of the ellipsis feels like it
rotates around the wrong pivot. It doesn't do so when swiping to the left.
Maybe that's because the scrolling left animation of the bar is eased when
tapping the button and the rotation animation is not. Maybe its even easier to
bind the rotation angle to the current horizontal shift of the bar (coming
from WPF here, so maybe it doesn't make sense).

Clearing the browser before loading a new article would be nice. Loading takes
a while and tapping on a headline just to see the old content can be a bit
strange.

~~~
Livven
Thanks, that's some very interesting and useful feedback!

1\. I assume "the ability to content" means voting/commenting? ;)

2\. The advantage of those colored bars is that they are very easy to visually
parse, while also requiring very little indentation. In fact, it would take 40
levels of comment

What was unusual was that my revenue went from... very little to enough to
quit my dayjob in a very short period of time. Afterwards, I gave the guy a
lot of free credit, just 'cause he was so impactful to my business, but he did
another review not that long after, finding that Linode's superior I/O (and, I
think, more VCPUs) made more difference for his application than the
additional ram that I gave them at the tested price point.

My point is that when something gains natural traction on one user-curated
news sites, it's only natural that it will gain traction on other user-curated
news sites with overlapping userbases.

I use Tinder and have met a ton of really amazing people through it, including
a girl who is now my best friend's long term girl friend. I don't use it to
date though purely because if I venture into that realm, the temptation to
play it like a game is too high.

However, if you want to know how to Tinder, it's simpler than this is making
it:

1\. Choose pictures where you look good. Simple as that, don't overthink it -
whatever "looks good" means to you is probably right. If not, ask your friend
of opposite sex.

2\. Write something funny in your description that leads the other person to
have something to say to you.

3\. Don't be shy - message people you find interesting with what you find
interesting about them. If you don't find anything interesting about them and
have nothing to say, don't send anything! If what you find interesting about
them is they're attractive, that counts as finding nothing interesting about
them.

4\. Ask them out with your friends. The goal should be to include new people
in your life, and the best way to do that is to say "my friends are going out
to x place tonight, would you like to join us? It'll be x number of us, bring
your friends if you want".

#4 is why Grouper is so fantastic btw.

Privacy, I would guess.

For exemple, you could see that your Tinder match was from X town and liked A,
B, F, G, K pages.

You could then go in FB Graph and write "Girls from X who likes A, B, F, G, K
pages". This returns two results and you find the girl. Even easier if you
knew her first name, you could go "People named Z who likes ... in ... city."

I did car trip around Iceland few years ago in may, having most of inner part
still unreachable due to metres of snow. Running tiny Chevrolet Spark in
places like Western fjords on their dirt roads with meeting car overy 1-2
hour, good memories. Communal pools could be found in most small villages
around, I recall a big one in Akureyri, second largest city (population
18,000). Definitely part of the culture and considering overall ridiculous
prices there, pretty cheap.

But all pools are standard treated clean water although whole island has
natural hot springs with bluish hot water coming straight form he ground all
over it (it's basically like a big volcano all over). Very few places to enjoy
those. I guess tourists want to have different experiences than those living
there.

I would definitely agree with that. In the US large parts of the country seem
fairly alienated from each other. Not only do they seem to not be able to
relate to each other but often times actively vilify. I have only lived at the
West coast which largely seems at odds which some other parts of the country.
Parts of the South come to mind immediately. The circumstances people live I
seem so very different and thus are their needs and concerns. I rarely meet
people who have social bonds to the South who fondly talk about them. I fact
that might have never happened. For contrast on Iceland life also send to be
very different if you live in Reykjavik rather than I a farm in the rural

apps that are routinely in the top 100 these days (Pinterest, Dubsmash &

Slightly off-topic but we're in the middle of building an iOS / Android SDK /

I have been surprised how hard it is to turn up prior-art on this subject.

Couple of companies come to mind:

* Realm.io has successfully positioned themselves as a thought leader in swift development for iOS by producing solid blog content and leading the Swift SF meetups (+ contributing to open-source projects).

* Crashlytics/Fabric.io is more interesting -- my experience with them has been entirely word-of-mouth (but they have a big presence at Twitter's developer conference/WWDC/Google IO, too).

* Parse generally has interesting, high-quality technical blog content: ([https://blog.parse.com](https://blog.parse.com)).

I agree that both Realm and Fabric have done an excellent job reaching out to
developers. Fabric went to another level in providing a slick interface to
make it easy to drop in and update their SDKs. I'd be excited to see that more

I sketched a really rough palm tree and it suggested a bunch of tree drawings,
one of which was a palm. That's helpful, but everyone who wants a palm gets
the same palm. Wouldn't it be great if the tool recognized that I was trying
to draw a palm and then improved mine by adjusting it according to what it

Everyone should have the freedom to their opinion. However, if I say I don't
like gay marriage..I have a really good possibility of getting fired from my
job and being called "homophobic". I've even heard that even stating this
opinion is a form of discrimination. Let's be clear here, I'm not talking
about bullying people that are gay or attacking them personally.

Along those same lines, I've seen horrible things being said about anyone
religious. Horrible and bigoted shit. Yet, there is no outcry. Nobody is
getting fired for essentially doing the same thing to another group of human
beings.

Saying you "don't like gay marriage" is a bit like someone in 1950s America
saying they "don't like interracial marriage." I don't think that someone
should get fired from their job for believing that (because I wouldn't wish
that on many people), but it seems that it would be hard for someone to
reconcile those beliefs with fair and positive treatment of all people in
their work-world. How can you feel that someone shouldn't be entitled to get
civilly married while still fully respecting them as a person?

It’s not just the 30% cut, it’s the “loan” that stores get by withholding
payments to developers for arbitrary amounts of time.

If you have a poorly-performing app, it may take _months_ for a few
“purchases” to even reach you! Meanwhile, all expenses (web hosting, $99/year
developer fees, etc.) don’t stop, and any downsides (e.g. supporting
“customers”, or reviews from “customers”) still affect you.

Apple loves to boast about its thousands of “developers” but imagine the size
of the slush fund Apple can maintain if there are tons of poorly-selling apps
not being paid out for awhile? It’s a large, interest-free loan to Apple.
Meanwhile, discoverability and other features that could actually improve
sales are entirely up to Apple (and most of these suck).

So if you devote most of your time to a poorly-discovered app that no one
buys, you can’t make money. Thus, it isn’t surprising at all that lots of apps
start to be “shoveled” into the store, in the hopes that the poor sales of all
of them combined will be sustainable. Rinse and repeat.

Apple is directly responsible for huge problems with the app economy, and
there is really no defense of their tactics at this point.

As I said in an earlier thread:

Apple pioneered the 30% cut, and it was a massive improvement over the status
quo. But they haven't ramped down at all since and that's why these
conversations and cases are happening.

Also for game theoretic reasons, they should charge a higher % for in-game
purchases and lower their cut for outright purchases.

Honestly, I'm blown away that 1) people would pay monthly for a custom font

app.

I feel like this is a statement about iOS development in general; that
perceived design is more important than the continued functionality of an app.

Or, maybe I'm just reading it wrong and the custom font was a one-time
purchase.

I don't think that's strange at all. The look and feel of an app -- especially
a simple tool like a notes app -- is a large part of what makes it valuable.
There are many people who don't care, but they were never going to pay for an
app in a category that has so many free alternatives. Those who are willing to
pay are exactly the sort of customers who are delighted by the attention to
detail that is exemplified by using a custom typeface.

There is no _right_ starting place. There are lots of good starting places
though. What have you looked at so far? Have you tried anything yet?

 _What language should I pick up if I am interested in creating a dynamic
website?_

Expect at least one "use X" answer from fanbois of every language "X" in
existence. Ultimately you can use Java, Python, Groovy, Scala, Ruby, Clojure,
Haskell, Erlang, Fortran, or COBOL; whatever floats your boat. But if you're
looking for a recommendation for a language that's particularly good for
"Getting started," I'll throw out Groovy, Python and Ruby as good choices,
especially if your interest is in building web-apps. You'll also want to learn
some Javascript in either case.

 _How can one get started learning something like Python or JQuery?_

Buy a book titled something like "Learning Python" or "JQuery in Action."
Google "Python tutorial" or "JQuery tutorial." Go to the python.org website
and/or the jquery.org website and browse the docs... look for links like
"tutorial" or "Getting started." Start writing code. Get stuck, Google for
answers... get really stuck, post questions on Stackoverflow or on relevant
mailing lists. Pick a project to build and start building it... iterate over
those last few steps. Find a user's group for the language you pick in your
area. Attend the meetings and "hack nights" (if they do something like that.)
Write more code. Look for interesting videos on youtube, watch those. The
Google Tech Talks series offers all sorts of stuff. Write up a blog post when
you learn something cool or implement something interesting. Fork interesting
projects on Github and play around with them. Make some minor improvement or
add some new feature. Release an open-source project on Github.

If you get that far, you should be good to go. Never stop learning though.

exercise and try to think about why this might not be the dumbest decision
ever. Maybe it could be more than just a ploy to increase sales of 1st party
cups. Maybe it's about Quality control.

I grew up playing a lot of Nintendo games. SNES. N64. Gamecube. Wii. There was
one thing I noticed about it. Nintendo always made the best stuff. They made
the best controllers. The best games. The best memory cards. I had a 3rd party
memory card that said it stored "56 blocks." But if you tried to put more than
20 on it, you'd sometimes find your data magically lost in the morning.So
despite the GNU/Linux ethos (I'm typing this on a Linux machine), freedom to
use 3rd parties does not always give a better user experience. More than that,
I found Nintendo also had to approve every single game and accessory that was
compatible with their system (seal of approval). So even that was considered
the good stuff. This seal keeps a certain floor of quality control

The way I see it, they probably did it somewhat incrementally. To some degree,
they've ALWAYS programmed the ECUs "to the test", because isn't that basically
what the authorities want? A system that meets standards X, Y, and Z, as
verified by a test of X, Y, and Z? What got them into trouble was the fact
that ECUs became more and more sophisticated, allowing them to gradually
isolate X, Y, and Z into ever-shrinking "islands" of compliance. It was
tolerated for so long that both engineering and management probably became
accustomed to cheating the test to some degree, so when the standards became
even more stringent, they basically saw nothing wrong with creating a special
"clean" ECU profile narrowly tailored to the specific parameters of the test
procedure. Granted, they knew they were cheating, but I think when you're
inside the corporate bubble and everyone's operating on the premise that
cheating has always been tolerated on the test, it becomes harder to be the

Insurance and Pensions are trickier, and it gets to the point of real
(inflation adjusted) versus nominal returns. If an insurance company needs to
invest against a real returns, than a 3% interest rate with 0% inflation is
the same as 7% with 4% inflation. This is how we should think of our 401Ks -
as long as we maintain purchasing power, the # of the rate doesn't matter.
(Rates rise when inflation rises and goes down when it shrinks) The flip side
is if insurance companies or pensions make nominal promises ("Give us 10% of
your income per year, and we'll invest it guaranteed at a 5% return") then it
becomes problematic. But in a low rate environment, people shouldn't be making
these kinds of promises.

Do people here think there's any importance to how professional/personal the
domain name of your site is? For example, I registered inconsistent.nl

I would argue that people who are unwilling to give their opinion (and I know
that there's many on both sides of everything, that are quiet), are simply
forcing themselves into an uncomfortable situation.

Often you (or rather I) will deal with the results of your opinion, but for
the freedom it offers, and the drive it gives me, I'll stick by it.

The only party I've seen so far _actually_ trying to make this storm in a

playing that card is cheap and dishonest, at best.

I'm no psychologist, but to my mind, that kind of behavior absolutely _reeks_
of awareness that the thing you're trying to make be about something else

I'm gonna copy what I said in the other thread, because it's more relevant

You know, reading the various devs' tweets, they use twitter in a way that is
completely foreign to me. Is there anything these guys think that they don't
tweet? ("Hey, who's picking me up from the hotel?" is not something I'd ever
announce to the world at large.)

This incident shows a danger of working that way--one of these guys apparently
had a rude little thought best kept private--and let's admit it, we all have
those thoughts at one time or another. But because he tweets everything, that
little passing thought was pushed to the world, which is not good for anyone
involved.

From reading the article I make some inferences and try to explain what I

GamerGate is a movement of some kind (I actually have no idea what they
support) that began deploying an attack called 'doxing' (which I understand
involves publicly disclosing the identity behind social media personas in
order that real life attacks/intimidation can be conducted against the actual
humans) against people they are against.

First comment, by the OP, asked,

 _I'm curious as to what HN thinks about this._

Since you asked, I'll say that Crabtree has certainly mastered the Science
News Cycle

<http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1174>

by making a press release that has had uptake from dozens of news outlets. But
none of those news outlets seem to have reporters on staff who are competent
to judge the genetics issues involved, or who even know sources in the
Behavior Genetics Association. (The article you have kindly submitted has
better sourcing and analysis than most of the previous articles based on the
same press release that I have seen, as the reporter took more care before
rushing to print.) I have friends in the Behavior Genetics Association (I'm
part of the Facebook group for the association), and I've already asked them
about this. Gerald Crabtree has some interesting institutional affiliations
and previous accomplishments,

<http://www.hhmi.org/research/investigators/crabtree_bio.html> but he is not
leading researcher on the genetics of human intelligence--I have met most of
those at a meeting of the International Society of Intelligence Research. If I
saw more discussion of this idea in the actual science online sites rather
than just in gee-whiz popular articles, I would think that there is more
"there" here.

Have you seen reviews of James R. Flynn's new book Are We Getting Smarter?
Flynn's book deals with much more recent times (just the last century) but has
the advantage of being based on actual IQ tests.

Microsoft used to be a company that produced terrible software and was yet
utterly dominant. They're now a company that produces beautiful software (in
my opinion) and are entirely unable to get people to buy it. I don't own a
Windows tablet or a Windows phone, because the app selection is awful, but
I've used both and they are fantastic. Speaking of which, with all their
money, how are they not paying app developers to port things to their
platform? With their marketing expertise, how are they not just shoving these
phones into people's hands? When people think of Ballmer they think of Vista
or "DEVELOPERS!" or throwing chairs about Google. I think of his failure to
drive adoption.

I'm also one of thousands of people who has my digital content locked up by
them due to their ridiculously complex digital rights management on the 360,
that is far far more ornate and frustrating than anything rootkit-toting sony
has ever thrust upon me.

They are paying people to develop apps for their platform. oodles and oodles
of cash. it's literally a joke amongst mobile developers that they have come
to almost expect a pay-day from microsoft to port things to their platform.

In my opinion, they have meticulously dug themselves into a hole of being
generally untrustworthy, and it will take a miracle to extricate them from it.

Here's a little example of what it looks like, from examples/royalfamily.slo:

Ask HN: Is 'Handy.com for offices' a viable business idea? - faisalkhalid80
I&#x27;m thinking of launching a &#x27;Handy.com for offices&#x27; product in London. Is this a viable idea? The only reason I&#x27;m asking is because it seems Handy.com and others have not even bothered trying to crack this market.<p>Am I missing something? Is the market really small, is that why Handy.com and others haven&#x27;t bothered with it? What is it?<p>As someone who&#x27;s run small offices (50 ppl) in London, I&#x27;ve personally found it quite hard to keep up with all the things that needed to be done. Cleaning esp is a pain. In the past I&#x27;ve used cleaning services recommended by the building, but its hit or miss really.<p>I&#x27;ve always wished there was something like an Uber for office services, just press a button and have someone show up to fix or clean up, so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m building, but just keen to know why it seems no one else has done it before. It just seems like not having to worry about dealing with issues in the office would tremendously boost my and the office managers productivity, hence keen to try this.

I'd be as huge fan. Running a small office with 15 people in it takes a lot of
work. I'm definitely not above mopping the floors, doing the dishes or hanging
whiteboards myself, but it's more effective for me to pay someone to do this
while I spend my time working on the product or helping someone else.

I can't speak for the size of the market, but offices we've looked at in LA
don't often include cleaning services, and there are a lot of small offices
that couldn't justify a full time person for this role.

I would like to be able to get the same person most of the time.

The services that would be important to consider doing are:

    
    
      - Cleaning  
      - Assembling new desks/furniture  
      - Light repair and maintenance (stuff not covered by the lease and doesn't require speciality knowledge)   
      - Setup / Cleanup

This is another key component in Google's strategy to create a suite of

make them money and (incidentally) cut way into Microsoft profits.

Now as a start-up - are you wasting money running a host of "internal" support
software or are you using what is out there and freely available? The latter
of course, because what matters is what you are building. Well that's how it
is gong to be soon for a lot of businesses who have "made it" - they are not
going to waste money and (perhaps more important) management time running
their internal support IT functions. Yes they will run ERP systems but why get
tangled up with office software/email/Intranet etc. etc.

EDIT: I maybe better should say, how much easier it is to use. After, all it
is a JVM, so it will be slower than C, obviously, but you also get rid of the
million of possible bugs you can introduce in it (which makes using Python so
attractive to me). So, is there a good reason for somebody who as used either
Python or OpenMP for multiprocessing to switch to Clojure?

~~~
leif
Python is almost always memory-heavy. C is not, if you do it right. Of course,
C, if you do it right, will be the fastest, it's the "do it right" that's
hard. Clojure, on the JVM, will be slower than C "done right", but faster than
most C, because the JVM's JIT is surprisingly smart. Any performance problems
you get with Clojure can usually be mitigated by adding type hints to force
your repetitive calculations to use primitive type operations, which will get
compiled by the JVM to direct machine instructions, as fast as C.

You should switch to Clojure from Python because it's faster.

You should switch to Clojure from C because it's easier, and more
specifically, easier to get it to a certain level of speed (which is high).

Don't let the JVM fool you into thinking it's slow. It isn't.

~~~
fnl
Well, I do not quite agree with your argument that Python is "always memory-
hungry". As a matter of fact, writing "good" Python code is a very seldom
observed art and most performance issues can be gotten rid of if you know
enough about the language and follow the style and design advices of true
"Pythonistas", as the "gurus" there call themselves (and many more who do not
deserve that title ;)). However, I have been programming several years in Java
on an earlier assignment, where stuff got so clumsy I wrote a 6 page manual
for my team outlining "don't do's" in Java because it would either cost tons
of performance or memory, mostly related to very basic stuff such as
instantiation strategies and everything that might be "good" for OOD, but bad
for performance. We ended up writing most of the core of the system in Lisp
and then generated

all use words related to human activities and the roots of machine learning

something to be passed out to the lowest bidder.

So much time spent in meetings, an hour with 10 people discussing how a
feature should work, when I know I could have just coded it up in that hour
and they would have just said "Yeah, like that".

Coding is engineering, but in an accelerated form. Improve the performance of
an engine by 10%, something the user could notice instantly? Hard work, big
dollars, lots of resources, hard to deploy to many users. Improve the
performance of an application by 10%? You might do it by yourself in 30

I am a programmer and I am very passionate about coding. I think it all comes
from the fact that I loved mathematics and physics in school. I love solving
problems, finding ways to reach your goal using your logic. On the other hand,
I dislike designing because I am not good at creating something without a
specific goal. I can't just think up ideas for design. However, when I am
faced with a problem where I have a starting point and I have a target to
reach (implement feature X into Y), I am thrilled by finding the logic behind
making everything work like desired.

As for you, I don't think there's anything you can do to really love coding.
You love designing because something in it thrills you I am sure. But if you
cannot find something to thrill you in coding, there's not much to do about
it. How about you use free frameworks to create websites instead? It would
save you a lot of time on the coding part and you would have more time to
spend on things you like. Try to find one that minimizes the parts you dislike
about website creation and that gives you the most freedom on thing you like.

OpenGL ES 2.0 over DirectX. I wonder how much help it might provide in this
context.

At this point, it appears to be possible to target iOS, Android, and webOS
with C and OpenGL (I haven't tried building an app this way, but it's on my
to-do list). Here's hoping that this development means I can add Windows Phone
to this list. :-)

This only works for games. How do you do User Interface in C on Android?

For games, windows phone doesn't support opengl es. So you still need to
rewrite some code.

Build your own UI widgets with OpenGL? :-P

It does look like someone is already experimenting with an OpenGL ES
implementation over XNA, so we might still have access to some form of OpenGL

I doubt XNA based Opengl ES will be efficient. If I were a game developer, I'd
rather rewrite my code.

The Game problem can be solved with game engines. But I'd like to write opengl

To Improve Your Sense of Direction, Lose the Technology (2017) - Tomte

======
ddingus
This is really foreign to me. Direction has never really been a question.

I grew up rural. Direction, where north is, etc... got built in early. Long
hikes into the hills, canyons. By teen age years, most of us had the whole
place mapped.

Today, I still can catch myself orienting, picking up references. When I
travel abroad, I experience this massive orientation for a while, placing
everything new with reapect to that which is known.

As a very young person, direction was a part of memory. I can tell you which
direction all our houses faced and what was nearby.

Late 60's and early 70's were when those defining times happened. Maps made
immediate sense.

If I were to struggle with this today, losing the tech is one option, but
augmenting senses in the ways mentioned are likely to have better outcomes.

If you value these things, you want to grok, in the sense Heinlein meant. Make
it an intrinsic part of you, automatic.

One of my favorites is sitting in an airplane. Front seats are different from
kiddle and rear ones too. But, when I concentrate, I can feel the course
changes, look out the window, identify the center point of a turn...

I feel this is something, this direction awareness, almost all of us can
improve on. Worth it.

Seems to me apps can help here. Give people aural, haptic feedback and just
have them place their phone consistently.

Always be aware of where the Sun is: how high in the sky, and in which
direction.The Sun will always tell you where North (or South) is. It becomes
so ingrained that North is always automatically known.

Yes some days are cloudier than others, but the direction of the brightest
light can be ascertained at many times during the day. Do the same at night
with a few favorite stars/constellations.

Ask HN: Launching my first major site solo. Need advice. - curt

For the last couple months I've been building a site that has huge viral growth potential. Since I don't have any experience managing back-end systems (normally have assistance) I need to find a hosting solution that's really easy to manage and can scale quickly. I've been researching cloud hosting and looking at a few hosting companies. Since I'm bootstrapping the startup currently, I'm budget conscious. Any recommendations on companies or hosting methods? The site is entirely php, uses mysql, and I'm looking to add Ajax soon.<p>Additionally, can anyone recommend a good open source shopping cart? Looking mainly just for the back-end processing, I already created all the pages. Since I'll be selling physical products it needs to handle and process payment, address, and shipping information.

bpotter
Hi Curt,

I see two considerations for hosting: budget and technical ability. For
example, using Media Temple's DV service is going to be inexpensive ($50/mo to
start out), scalable, and simple to setup. Compare that to RackSpace Cloud
Servers
([http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/server...](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/servers/)),
which is even less expensive up front ($12 a month or so), but from what I
understand requires a bit more technical ability to setup/configure the server
(please correct me if I'm wrong folks, as I haven't used Cloud Servers yet,
just talked w/ people that have). Either option will easily scale.

There are many other options, but don't want to provide "advice" when I
haven't used solutions like <http://www.voxel.net/> or others.

Other considerations - is this going to be a global audience? If so, look into
using a CDN. You could use MT's CDN
(<http://mediatemple.net/webhosting/procdn/>) if you use the DV service since
it is currently only available for MT customers.

I don't have much experience with ecommerce platforms, but your needs seem
pretty basic and should be covered by any opensource option out there. Can you
think of anything specific that you'll need in the longterm spec

I have a lot of respect for these guys; I had a few new ideas for ways of
implementing Common Lisp, but decided not to when I realized with the amount
of free-time I have, it would be about a decade of work.

I've spoken to Robert online, and he mentioned that a lot of people told him a
from-scratch implementation was doomed to fail. The only reason those people
were wrong was in that they underestimated his tenacity.

Great talk. Both parts were interesting: tool building and the application of
designing molecules.

graphene
Super interesting.

If you read the Feynman speech that he references at the beginning, he
actually mentions that as you scale machines down, things like mechanical
rigidity will degrade and you will need to change your design rules
accordingly. I always assumed that when you reach the molecular level, thermal
motion and the constant bombardment by water molecules would mean that the
only viable option is to use proteins, just like nature does, so it's very
interesting to

 _" Emergent structures have the property of being possible to generalize
about and simulate to some extent by simpler means than the modeling of their
most fundamental components. When this is not the case, it means the large
scale result of the fundamental components is chaotic."_

Our brains require abstractions to function because our brains are _subsets_
of reality. You simply cannot pack all of existence into your brain to
conceive the whole thing at once. So _everything_ \-- every perceivable
phenomenon or relation that exists in any possible experience -- is going to
be _modeled_. This means that there does not exist anything that "when broken
into its components" is made of fewer abstract components than the whole.
That's contradictory nonsense.

Which means you can't assume that "when it happens," you'll get a chaotic
universe (or whatever you meant by that.) It's got nothing to do with scale,
since choosing to call one thing 'fundamental' and another an 'emergent whole'
is no less of an abstraction that swapping them around. You could just as
easily say the motion of particles is an emergent property of the temperature
of the whole, and you'd be no less wrong about it. It's a dualistic relation.

Which makes "emergence" a pointless concept. There is no "absolute simple" for
you to take as a fundamental abstraction from which other things emerge. And
I'm pretty sure the concept has never actually been used to solve a single
problem. Not even hypothetically.

This is Laughlin's thesis in his book [1]. The idea is that the mathematics of

One possibility is that they are counting on bidders being irrational and
desperate, in which case refusing to disclose keeps valuations irrationally
high and exploits the winner's curse; possibly the strategy here is to make
the Israeli National Library overpay because it is committed by
ethnonationalism to pay whatever price necessary, and revealing the contents
risks either public criticism of the National Library overpaying or scaring
away other bidders as they learn the papers are boring & losing leverage over
the National Library.

>In 1988 she sold the manuscript of The Trial for $2 million, at which point

To some, $2 million would be a bargain for, say, a new Kafka novel.

The conspiracy theorist side of me has often wondered whether maybe Kafka did
it intentionally. Intentionally left his novels unfinished, intentionally
started a legend that he requested them to be destroyed unpublished, etc. It
would certainly resonate with the tones and themes that permeate his works.
Perhaps he himself realized that no ending could possibly suit a novel like
"The Castle" better than the unfinished lack-of-ending he gave it, which makes
our hearts yearn so strongly for an ending, and which is such a great parallel
with the futility of the novel itself.

For the curious, this trial was eventually resolved in favour of Israel's
national library, on the grounds that this was Max Brod's instructions in his
will:

"But Judge Kopelman Pardo rejected Ms. Hoffe’s claim that the papers were a
gift from Mr. Brod to her mother, instead viewing them as a trust she was to
administer. The judge noted that Mr. Brod’s 1948 will instructed that his
archive go to a “public Jewish library or archive in Palestine,” and that he
later specified Hebrew University, where Israel’s national library is housed."

Why do internet services always seem to be more expensive in the UK? Surely
they should be able to be provided at approximately the same cost as the US.

For example, Steam games are consistently well above the US price + 20% for
VAT.

Netflix is £5.99 a month, which is over ten USD.

I'm sure there are many more examples.

~~~
bonaldi
There can be lots of reasons, not all of them just "that's what the market
will bear".

There is a genuine cost of doing business in the UK, for instance, in that you
can't fire staff on a whim, have to pay national insurance for them and so on.

For Netflix (and Spotify, I'd imagine) rights issues can also be expected to
come into play: rights holders may charge more for UK clearance than they
would US.

Steam I'm not sure about - they don't seem to have a UK operation. Perhaps
they join Adobe in the "squeeze them till they hurt" camp.

it?

Today, _$1 = P44.28_ so _P129 is just $2.91_.

Of course it was adjusted with the market value here in PH. It was really a
good deal. They also partnered with the telcos here to boost their presence.
And I think, they don't have much competition here in PH.

I was once responsible for designing mission critical embedded application
that would be guaranteed to withstand power cycle or crash at any time and
continue from the point it interrupted.

Wasn't very hard but it required rigorous design. The important pieces were
state machines that were committed to a log based storage at significant
points in operation.

Then there is detection and handling of repeating crashes which is where it
really gets interesting.

It is not very well known but the Apollo Guidance Computer had this same
capability! The famous program alarms (1202 and 1201) during the Apollo 11
descent were caused by low-priority jobs stealing processing power from the
high priority ones. The operating system was designed to just restart the
computer in those cases (this would kill the low priority jobs) and continue
execution from where it left off:

I began design and development with research on other projects with similar
requirements and AGC was one of them, I remember.

The difference in my case was that I did not have simple non-volatile memory
like AGC had, I had flash chip with no wear leveling. To protect the flash
from premature death I had to design my own database to store data in form of
deltas appended to the file. When it started it would scan from the beginning
of the file until last complete record and start from there. When the data in
the file reached preset size all live records would simply be rewritten to

I think Los Angeles--and much of southern California--need to worry about
preserving their water supply--especially the deep aquifers that take millenia
to recharge--before worrying about anything else. They need to fix this
problem now, because if they don't, southern California will become a
wasteland. The rate those aquifers are being depleted by farms in the San
Joaquin Valley is astounding; measurements have been taken showing subsidence
of an inch a month in some places. It may already be too late for southern
California, in all honesty. If I were living there, I would be finding a way
to move out as soon as possible. Yes, the water crisis out there really is
that bad.

Sorry I don't have any links handy, but my opinions are the result of spending
two days a couple of weeks ago researching California's and India's water
problems. I highly recommend doing some reading and watching some YouTube
videos to educate yourselves on these issues.

~~~
cpprototypes
The rest of the nation's attitude to California's water problem is very short
sighted. I don't think most people realize how much food is produced in
California. If California agriculture goes down, the result will be high food
price increases everywhere. Many just have a cavalier attitude of "the market
will adjust". There are big issues with just assuming "the market will adjust"

1) There is a big lag time for some crops to grow. Something like corn is no
problem. But apples or anything else grown from a tree? Or any other crop that
requires years of growing before it's productive? It will be many years until
the California output could be matched.

2) Other places like the Midwest have potential water issues too. For example,
look at the history of the Ogallala Aquifer. If a greater strain is put on the
aquifer, it's possible they will also have the same water shortages that
California has now.

The California water crisis is a national issue, but the rest of the nation

The quality of the text rendering could really be improved by using subpixel

Basically, every place you're likely to read code is going to look better than
the images generated with this.

Subpixel rendering requires knowing the pixel orientation (are sub pixels left
to right or top to bottom) and the order they are in (rgb vs bgr) and finally
assume that the display screen is in real full color mode, and not some limit

Because the EC is a market in which Oracle intends to make a substantial

Anti-trust actually has some meaning here, it stands for not being able to own
a substantial portion of the market and then being able to gobble up your
competitors (directly, or, as in this case indirectly).

American companies invariably explain this is a lack of 'free market', but it
is one of the few cases where I think that some government involvement in
business is actually a good thing.

The EC got to sharpen it's knives in this respect on a very unwilling telco
industry, and they are fairly sharp when it comes to stating how far is too
far.

Whether Oracle has crossed the line or not in this respect is hard to tell,
IBM still has Informix/DB2, there are other open source alternatives but I
think a fork of MySQL is another way of resolving this.

But then there would have to be a pre-sun style company behind it to give it
legs, otherwise corporations would never go for it.

NASA/Hasselblad Astronaut's Photography Manual (1984) [pdf] - aaronbrethorst
http://www.hasselblad.com/media/2207875/astronauts_manual_singlepage_lr.pdf

======
jrapdx3
The NASA Hasselblad was, and still is, an impressive piece of photographic
machinery. Hasselblads were used for a long time in the US space program, the
manual saying "since 1962" and obviously, well beyond 1984.

And indeed having been around in those years, the cameras proved their worth.
The images they captured were astonishing, looking like nothing else, in
essence a unique art form truly living up to its actual "other-worldliness".

I've often thought the photographs of the early space era are among the most
beautiful and haunting images of all time. The fascination with the photos and
the camera itself is certainly justified.

It was fun reading the pictorial advice contained in the manual, which stated
classic ideas anyone interested in photography has probably encountered many
times. Yet the lessons could still be profitably applied in the digital era. I
remember "exposing for the highlights" with transparency films, and even in
today's world often enough it's still a good idea.

~~~
friendzis
Film and digital differ fundamentally in how they capture under/over-exposed
areas. You can overexpose film and still preserve some - it won't be all
white, while underexposed is... pitch black. With digital its different: once
you overexpose you get plain white and everything is gone. Underexposed areas
still contain some detail.

~~~
aaronbrethorst
Digital and slide film are pretty similar in my experience. Color negative and
black and white negative film, on the other hand, definitely offer a lot more
opportunity for shadow and highlight recovery.

Interesting to see all the classic photography rules given in the context of
the space shuttle. Focusing for depth of field uses the example of the payload

manual in quite the same way ever again.

Oh, absolutely, but switching languages every weekend isn't going to get you

It sounds like at the very least your boss doesn't know how to be a leader in
the workplace either: if you have a shortcoming which is impacting the way you
are perceived by your leadership team, or your job performance, then it is
incumbent on leadership to:

1/ Help you understand the deficiency and determine whether it's real, or
optical (for example: "I see John coming in late all the time! That guy is
really lazy!" vs. "Wow, John comes in late and leaves early but he's SO
productive when he's here!")

2/ Provide you with clear practical steps you can take to improve, and what
the impact of you improving will be (on you, on the business)

3/ A clear expectation on what the consequences will be if you do not improve
(is it just "you're gonna be a midweight forever dude", or "the skills you
lack are vital for this job").

Most people have a cap on where their natural intuition and instinct can take
them as leaders. Going beyond that requires coaching, mentoring, and training.
If you were hired into a leadership role but can't lead, then it's a
deficiency of their hiring process. If you were hired as an individual
contributor (IC) and are being expected to lead, then you need coaching.

Do not accept the part of your brain which is telling you that this is on you.
If you were fired because you can't lead then that's terrible leadership in
and of itself.

Find somewhere with a strong engineering culture and great leadership. Be open
that you are worried about being stuck in Individual Contributor land forever
and that as part of your development, you want to receive coaching from a
leader who can help you adopt a leadership mindset. Make it clear this is not
about promotions, titles, or pay grades: you want to understand leadership and
have regular conversations with someone who is leading.

You do not need to be humbled.

That's just BS. Nothing about being a developer today has anything resembling
leadership role. If that were true, developers would be coached, that never
happens. They would decide what to build themselves, they do not. Others
decide what, when and how to build everything, using backlog, scrum and
sprints. You would have a

That's the mentality that leads to toasters running Linux. For many
applications there's absolutely no need for ARM MCUs and all their added
complexity.

Plus for the hobbyist at home, PIC still comes in DIP formats which is handy
for breadboarding or soldering without the added difficulty of SMT.

~~~
bitbckt
I couldn’t agree more with the parent.

Further, PIC isn’t the only “non-ARM” in this space. Your average RainBird
type water timer likely uses an MSP430, for example.

The idea that ARM should be used in any/all situations is naive.

~~~
exmadscientist
> The idea that ARM should be used in any/all situations is naive.

I mean, sure, this is true. MSP430s are great when you need the lowest power,
and AVRs are tiny and cheap for lowest cost. But... I do this for a living,
and there's a reason our go-to is the Cortex-M series. M3 or M4 if you need a
lot of CPU power, or M0/M0+ if you need small. They're just so, so much easier
to program that the trivial additional cost of the microcontroller washes away
in the noise.

And it's not like this leads to Linux toasters; the M0 is not a
microprocessor, it's a microcontroller. It's got a two-stage "pipeline" and
absolutely no memory protection! There are tricks to get the larger M3s to run
Linux, but it's hacky and not something you'd want to ship.

PICs are essentially obsolete, and none of us would _ever_ consider them for
new development. They're annoyingly constrained hoary old beasts.

The main difference I see between bikes/pedestrians and cars/motorcycles is
that there is minimal cost/effort to reverse and change your mind. So, on a
bike or on foot, you can jaywalk or run a red light by slowly peeking out and
making sure it's safe. If someone with the right of way is coming, you can
simple stop and let them by. You absolutely can't do that with a car or
motorcycle.

My general rule, as both biker and pedestrian, is to not get in the way of
others who have the right of way. They shouldn't have to change course or
worry about you. Most pedestrians (and plenty bikers too) are absolutely
clueluess though. They don't look for bike lanes, they walk in the bikelanes,
they jaywalk without looking if a bike (or car) is coming, they open car doors
without looking, etc. I think this frustrates a lot of bikers, so they end up
not caring and trying to ride through a crosswalk full of pedestrians and
doing other asshole things, but I don't think that's the norm.

As a reasonable adult, I know I shouldn't jaywalk or run a red light because
they are rules, but I have confidence via my senses that I can do that with
absolute safety and respect for myself and others.

Full disclosure: I do staffing, but I'm also a 20-year software developer and
15 year manager, so I'm an outlier. Assuming you're talking about regular
staffing companies, but here are some general reasons.

When you're hiring, you're often too busy do recruit yourself. What can hinder
your chances further is believing you don't have time to educate the
recruiters you've hired, and I've seen that, too. Of course, you may believe
that spending time with a typical recruiter will not help your cause.

You may not have a good network, either. Whether the typical recruiter has a
meaningful network depends on them, but it doesn't happen overnight. Most
recruiters are very friendly and extroverted, so at least face to face it's a
pleasant interaction.

You may be poor at marketing your company/open position to developers. This I
see a lot, in the same way I see great developers who don't market themselves
well. I recently came across a job description where the first three
paragraphs were about the company and the parent company - a very big name!
Even at the hiring company, there can be a disconnect about what developers
care about.

Finally, there are a lot of good developers who have no problem with
recruiters. What prompted me to enter staffing was the number and quality of
developers who came to me for help with their job searches, but I wasn't in a
great position to help. Truth is, job searches suck and if you can find
someone trustworthy to help with that, it's a relief.

You can get specialised recruitment agencies and I came across a few in London
who focus on one area. Head hunters will use all means necessary to get
details from a department of the type of people working there. They then do
build up a network of people outside

First of all, keep working on the C. It's a very important programming
language that underlies almost everything. If you learn to program C really
well, you'll be able to understand what's happening even when you're using
languages that are much higher-level than C.

As for a programming language to learn after C: try Ruby or Python. Both are
considered great languages. I'd not only recommend starting with Ruby, but if
I were you I would check out Hackety Hack at <http://hacketyhack.net> . It's a

will do for fun. If you can figure out the stuff on that site, you will be

As you can easily check with M-x find-function a `scroll-up` function is
implemented in C. This is a known problem - I can't find it right now, but I
remember I once read a blog post where the author complained about this: in
general you're not going to get good results when trying to advise, override
or modify C-level functions from Elisp code.

IIRC cl-flet was recently (well, in the current decade I think :)) modified to
be lexically scoped, so that won't work (anymore). This is why I had to use
`letf` with `(symbol-function 'symbol)` instead of a neater `(flet ((beep ()))
...)`.

Personally I deal with beeping like this:

    
    
        (setq ring-bell-function (lambda ()))
    

but this disables any beeping, which may not be what you want. In short,
things you `setq` or more generally `setf` tend to be visible from C functions
(no guarantees though).

On the other hand my Emacs (on Linux) refuses to beep in any circumstances
even if I run it with `emacs -Q` and do M-: (beep) - I have no idea why, I
suspect it's either my sound configuration or has to do with the way I built
my emacs from source.

I'd say for this:

    
    
        (funcall
          (funcall
              (lambda (a) (lambda (b) a))
              1)
          2)
    

raising a (void-variable a) error is correct behaviour under dynamic scoping.

Thankfully you can use Oculus devices (or at least, the Quest) with the new

being able to hack around on it through an adb shell.

Many of us here have experienced our work getting cloned by others. While I
totally get that 'everything is a remix', I still can't help but feel that
kick in the gut every time this happens. I am always bothered by how much I
care. It took me a while to reconcile this emotional-jerk. Here's how I see it
now:

John Cleese has a wonderful talk about how each project consists for 'open'
and 'close' modes [1]. In one sentence - open mode is playing around with
ideas and stumbling upon a gem in the rough, while closed mode is the
execution of polishing that gem to perfection.

Seen through this framework, I would claim that 'cloning' is the act of
jumping in on someone else's open-mode work, and forking a new close-mode.

Why do we care when someone does this? I think that as the open-mode is a
highly creative process, it is hard to not get emotionally attached to the
rough-gems it produces. Some will describe it as nothing shy of birthing an
idea. In that sense, the kick-in-the-gut that I feel is probably the sense of
loss associated with someone 'snatching my new-born'.

I'm not suggesting that cloning is good or bad, but just trying to provide a
reasonable explanation to why we feel pain when someone clones our work - even
though we know it's OK.

[EDIT: there are situations where 'cloning' is in essence thievery. And that's
not OK. Where to draw the line deserves its own thread.]

While change.org states their opinion that "It's pretty clear the attack is in
response to the [Ai Weiwei] campaign" and strongly implies that it's the
Chinese government responsible, it seems a bit of a leap to me.

First, DDOS is not something that the Third Department seems to do much of.
They'd be much more likely to spearphish people at change.org and then host
some malicious code on the website. The "Jasmine Revolution" calls for protest
was something that the entire party was very pissed about, but those calls
emerged from a relatively small blogging service based in north carolina that
would have been easy to take down - yet nothing happened.

Second, DDoS source country != DDoS controller. This should be obvious to
everyone. Obviously when anon DDoS'd paypal et al. most of that traffic was
coming from the US, but no one thinks the US was behind it. China has some of
the highest rates of infected computers on the net, obviously many of those
will be in bot nets that can be rented for any purpose. When you hire zombies
it's quite possible to specify what countries you want them to be in.

Clearly it's become quite common to blame China for hacking very quickly. A
lot of the time that's only based on something like the IP address of the CnC
host being based in Beijing. The difference here is that's usually a safe bet
because of the PLA's massive ongoing program of malware based espionage.

Here they really don't have the same history. I'm sure a program like
change.org has a lot of people who don't like them, and who better in this
environment to try to blame your bad actions on than China? Hell, the story is
a big potential boost for change.org publicity too. At the current time the
web site seems to be dealing pretty well. Surprisng considering a spot like

I&#x27;m a long time reader of Mr. Graham and other essayists like Mr. Welch of stilldrinking.org, they are writers that I very much like reading, and they also tend to write in a very conversational manner- PG even has an essay titled &quot;Write Like You Talk&quot; [1].<p>When I reflect on the various technical books I&#x27;ve read over my life, I realize that the ones that I am able to get through most easily and pick up the ideas within with the least amount of friction are those written in a more colloquial manner.

I think it's important to differentiate Conversational and Stream of
Consciousness tones. Most people speak as they think of ideas which falls
under Stream of Consciousness. If you write that way, you will end up with an
unorganized mess full of filler words and phrases. The professors who say
don't write conversationally are actually warning you not to fill your writing
with the nonsense that permeates normal speech.

Paul Graham mentions taking physically awkward bits and making them sound
conversational. That is the trick. Don't start with stream of consciousness
and call it conversational. Start with normal writing and make it flow like a
conversation.

Writing conversationally is a bit like writing dialogue. The trick it to taken


From there you could build UI "kits" that use the core functionality but each
have a distinctive look and feel.

~~~
tomelders
For the past few years, i’ve been building “reusable component libraries” and
I can say with confidence that they’re a massive waste of time.

When you get into it, the UI usually the least difficult problem to solve in
an app. The real challenge is state management, control flow, and wrangling
sode effects.

Alas, people are still wedded to the idea that UI is where all the time is
wasted.

The truth is, it’s always been easy to put a button on a screen. But making
that button do something? That is a much bigger problem. I’d argue that 99% of
the effort of putting a button on a screen goes into implementing whatever
that button does. But stakeholders don’t understand that. They think buttons
just do the thing they do, so when it takes six weeks to put a button on
screen, they naturally assume that a reusable component library that includes
a button will somehow shave days and weeks off a project.

Which is why they gravitate towards UI libraries. And then they introduce a
new problem that wasn’t there before. They want us to use Material UI, but
they want us to make it look different. And they want a bunch of extra UI
elements to boot. So not only do we still have all the original problems of
creating an app, we’re now on the hook for turning some implementation of
Material UI into something that fits with with our architecture, but is also
completely different.

So while I hate UI libraries, I recognise that they’re something inflicted on
a team. So I’ve started work on a UI library designed specifically to address
this problem. It’s a UI library that’s meant to be changed and easily
customised by it’s consumers. It’s minimal functionality and minimal styling.
I’ll announce it here on HN when I think it’s ready. It may never be ready
because not only is it a difficult problem to solve, I’m also very lazy.

But anyway, I say all this because I hear what you’re saying, and I’m working
on it.

One nice thing that this release does that isn't explicitly mentioned in the

Maybe Dotty will bring some excitement back to Scala, these days it's just

The one thing I would like is for all functions to be pure by default and we
could have something like "impure def" for functions with side-effects and
functions that take mutable objects as arguments. It's basically my only
complaint about the core language. Well, I would also like iota and defer from
Go, but that's minor.

~~~
dpratt
Enforcing pureness on the function might be difficult w.r.t. things like IO,
due to Java interop, and frankly that's one of the strengths of the platform.

Inferring loose immutability constraints on a function would be interesting.
You could implement it in the compiler, perhaps something like an annotation
on a method that declares all inputs must consist of only final/immutable
values, enforced all the way down the chain.

This is more of a JVM gripe, but as long as we're talking about Go, I'd _love_
to see actual VM-level coroutine support. It'd make async code in Scala a lot
easier to both author and debug.

~~~
tormeh
Well, you could just assume that all non-Scala code is impure.

Actually, thinking about it, why not just make it illegal to modify arguments,
full stop? It's perhaps the worst software practice I can think of.

Facebook twitter apps can just scrape twitter for your most recent status

_What's left is local news, investigative journalism and intelligent coverage
of national news. Perhaps 2% of the cost of a typical paper._

I'd like to see a citation on that "2%". I don't believe it.

What will we miss? Obviously, the basic reportage function of newspapers is
what we'll miss--the boring research, interviewing, verifying, and so on. This
is something that bloggers cannot reproduce without a news infrastructure and
being on salary.

~~~
lliiffee
2% seems to me laughably low. I would think it is something like 50%. It might
take up 2% of the _space_ of a paper, but the reasons we will miss it is
because no one else appears ready to do it. Why not? Expense.

How many investigative journalists do you think the NY Times employs? IIRC
they have about 800 employees, so maybe 100 tops. Let's say the cost of
employing them is 20M per year. Last year the NYT made 6 million on revenue of
748 million, which means their costs must be 742 million. This makes Seth's
numbers roughly correct.

~~~
lliiffee
You seriously believe that 98% of the NYT expenses are consumed by movie
reviews, the crossword guy, and David Brooks? Anyway, the fact is, Seth pulled
that number out of his ass, and that is irresponsibly sloppy at best. (And,
ironically, an excellent example of the kind of thing editors and fact-
checkers are for...)

You're forgetting the actual paper and the cost of distributing it.

We know the revenues (roughly) and that the expenses are about the same. How
many actual investigative reporters do you think that the NYT has? Multiply
that number by your guess of their average burdended cost and compare that to
the total expenses.

I work regularly with Hadoop users and I there is rarely talks of
"shortcomings" of Hadoop. More often than not, rather than Hadoop not giving
enough to the user, the user is not giving enough to Hadoop. Once users start
understanding the power of the platform, they start to do some really
incredible things.

Hive and Pig are just applications that interface with Hadoop, although they
could be classified as "SQL" or "PigLatin" to Java Map/Reduce, they are also
more than that. For example, Hive has a shared metastore so you can treat
Hadoop kind of like a shared RDBMS that allows you to map schemas after the
data has already been transformed.

Most the people I talk to, especially on here, are still pretty wet behind the
ears when it comes to Hadoop. It's a very daunting technology, but I can
assure you there is nothing but progress and innovation in the community.

I agree that this is a new and daunting technology, but its also technically

Linux and Hadoop are not analogous. I've used Linux since the pre-1.0 days and
been building distributed computing and database platforms since before Hadoop
existed; I've seen both of these ecosystems grow from the inside.

Linux won the server wars because it rapidly iterated and evolved in a time
when a free UNIX-like operating system was desperately needed. In the early
days of the Internet, no operating system was ready to be a heavy duty
Internet server OS. FreeBSD, started from a stronger position than Linux but
development was carefully controlled by academic purists. Eric Raymond's "The
Cathedral and The Bazaar" was about these two communities.

Operating systems, like Linux, tend toward natural monopolies. It is
extraordinarily expensive to build a competitor. Linux was the most agile and
rapidly evolving competitor in an early market that was poorly served by
incumbents. While it took the rest of the world years to notice, it was
obvious by

So here is our approach to something that will, hopefully, work better:

\- it has a feedback system that allows you to indicate why you don't like
someone (too old, too male, too boring etc)

\- video starts out blurry, and becomes sharper with time (hence the name! ;))

\- you can 'like' people, allowing the other to see when you're online and
request to connect with you

Could this work? Comments, suggestions?

Guarantees, SLAs, and Hollow Promises - nkohari
http://kohari.org/2009/12/07/guarantees-slas-and-hollow-promises/

======
wgj
The usefulness of an SLA is not the refund to the customer. It is the cost to
the provider, which if painful enough, assures the customer that the provider
has incentive to keep the service up.

This blog post says, in so many words, they would rather not be bound by such
incentives. (and they are seeking customers who have no such requirements.)

~~~
nkohari
Sort of... the point was more that the promises are pretty hollow in the first
place. We don't need financial penalties being applied to motivate us to keep
our service up, at least beyond the natural loss of customers if we were to be
down for an extended period of time. I think offering anything beyond that,
for a service as low-cost as ours, would be lying to our customers.

~~~
wgj
Agreed, and lying is never a great idea. But you also specifically noted that
you do not invest in the kind of solutions that help ensure better uptime
stats. And other sites that have failover and other HA techniques are not
making empty promises. They are showing that they intend to try harder, and
your blog post so much as admits they really do try harder (with more
expensive architecture, and the willingness to be penalized on failure.)

So, regardless of the icing on the cake, you seek customers who do not rely on
uptime. That's a valid choice, and I mean no disrespect. I'm just calling it
what it is.

~~~
nkohari
I suppose you're right. We felt that it was more worthwhile to price our
services lower and avoid going overboard with HA, because our application is
arguably not "mission-critical". If it's down for awhile, it's bad, but no one
dies and money is probably not lost (at least not a lot).

The investments we do make in infrastructure are geared more towards disaster
recovery, because if we went down and lost our customers' data, it _would_ be
a much more critical failure on our part.

~~~
wgj

Heck, I'm impressed that enough people are running an MTA that touches
incoming mail for this to be effective. It was never "easy", even in the 90s.
Back then it was an issue of having a performant, secure config. But these
days, it's way more complex and too much money.

I wouldn't think that many people are using fetchmail + local MTA anymore, but
maybe I'm wrong.

I used to do it for my family, but maintaining an MTA, spam filtering,
IMAP/POP, webmail, CalDAV & CardDAV is rough. And supporting folks hooking up
their devices that increasingly needed to go 8 menus deep to punch in the
settings for something that wasn't gmail/hotmail/outlook was just too much.

And then you can't run it out of your house, unless you pay money for static
IPs, or you pay for hosting and make sure you keep yourself off blocklists.
Just the cost of doing it made it not worth it unless you hit economy of scale
number of users.

That said, sendmail did improve my M4 skills FWIW.

I have a related question. I had an idea many years ago and I've poked at it
irregularly since. I have kids and I've already had one startup fail, so I
just kind of slow-rolled this one.

I still believe the idea has merit, so I keep poking at it here and there. I
spent money on design work and it's incorporated, but I don't have a partner
or support mechanism.

I had a BizSpark account, but I "graduated" in February, so I can't host the
API for free anymore. I was considering redeveloping the API in serverless
AWS, but that will take time. I have a working API in .NET Web API.

So I'm I'm missing a place to deploy my API (and an Identity Server
implementation for OAuth2) and an iOS developer to implement the designs.

Looking for advice...and

Right now a whole economy exists around these mundane jobs: All of the
warehouse workers [1], delivery personnel, and a ton of others do their
"mundane" jobs in the logistics chain, because that's what they can do. For
many people, their driver's license is the only real qualification they have.
But in the long term, not even a pilot's license will be a qualification that
ensures employment [2].

What happens to these people once autonomous driving becomes adopted on a
larger scale? Are they all gonna start working at Boston Dynamics, creating
more autonomous tools? Will they all learn to code and start writing apps?
Will they become successful artists? I seriously doubt that.

Will they work in newly created auxilareily industries? Maybe a few of them,
but the "new jobs created" from this will never make up the number of jobs
lost because the change to automation is also an increase in efficiency of
productivity, meaning that the same work can now be done with way less effort.

Work starts in £15m plan to get Concorde flying again - abstractbill
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8712806.stm

======
ctkrohn
Air transport is one area where technology has seemingly stagnated, or even
reversed. Airliners seem pretty much the same as when I was a kid. You
certainly don't get to your destination any faster. There have been
improvements -- aircraft such as the 787 are built with light and strong
composites; the A380 is the biggest airliner ever; low cost carriers have
driven down prices; you can get WiFi on certain flights. But you're not going
any faster, or traveling any more comfortably.

Compare that to the period from 1955 - 1975. Jets entered commercial service,
displacing slow and noisy gas-powered propeller planes. The Concorde made its
first flight in 1969, entering service shortly after. The US had its own
supersonic airliners on the drawing board. There were even proposals for
hypersonic transports. We ended up getting stuck with cosmetically identical
jetliners and a series of unmanned hypersonic test vehicles. Remarkable feats
like SpaceShipOne are few and far between.

Aerospace technology relies on inspiration. "Because we can" used to be a
large motivator. It's tough to get around economic or military reality, but at
the same time it's sad to see fewer mind-blowing engineering achievements.
Most of us couldn't afford a Concorde ticket, but I bet there were plenty of
people who still thought it was damn cool.

I mean, sure, people would _freak_ about a flying reactor, if only on
principle. But that sort of thing dies down with time.

Sorting is categorizing, just with an order imposed on the categories.

If the categories have a natural order, then people will exploit that when
they sort.

Suppose you had to put some cards with names on them into bins labeled by
first letter. You might go through the cards one by one and stick each in the
appropriate bin. It would help you if the bins are in alphabetic order, rather
than scrambled.

Sorting into categories involves a search to find the category for an item;
the search benefits from order.

Infinite, or recursive? Alphabetic, lexographic, and numeric sorts are

What topics, if any, should I consider off-limits?

There are a couple things you should know going in, or at least by the end of
the first call:

1) What is this PE firms model? Google them, cold call founders of companies
they've bought, etc. Some will want to buy you to integrate with existing
entities. Others want to accelerate your growth, based on their operating
model. If you don't have time to figure this out, you need to know all of
these details by the end of your first call.

2) What do you want out of the deal? Ever entrepreneur should have a number or
a vision, or both. You need to know what gets a deal done for you.

3) Why are they reaching out to you? Is it exploratory or already vetted and
strategic. Before you say anything of substance, you should understand where
they are at in the process. Oftentimes the level of the person you are
speaking with dictates the seriousness of the conversation / interest level.

4) Are they winners? Funds can't help but brag about their successes. Who are
their big exists? What do they return to their investors? How many funds have
they closed (and when)?

dnautics
I don't think open air seats are good when you've got a low atmospheric
pressure, either. It looks like the prototype is a mock-down at a lower scale.
The principal advantage of hyperloop is that it takes the atmosphere (which is
a liability for maglevs) and turns it into an asset,- by collecting it at the
front and redirecting it below as a mode of levitation. This means the tracks
can be unpowered. I'm not sure if the tracks are powered in the chinese
maglev, but the article said "superconducting" so that's energetically costly
either on the pod or on the tracks.

An interesting maglev alternative to superconduction is inductrack, which,
however, cannot be combined with magnetic propulsion -

But now I'm visiting a friend, and keep getting interrupted by them in order to do various things, and it seems like my intervals to get things done are altogether too small to really dive into my code. I've made minimal progress, even though there are so many things to do, and I have so much time(on aggregate) to do them.<p>Possible solution: every time I wrap up a coding session, write a paragraph summarizing what needs to be done next, why, and where?

When I know I am wrapping up a coding session, I'll often leave a few trivial
things unfinished - so that when I sit back down again for the next session,
I'll have an easy place to jump right back in, and it will force me to
(consciously or otherwise) get back to somewhere near the mental state I was
in when I half-finished the thing.

In this particular situation, pick what you want to do: get your coding done
or visit your friend. If the priority is the former, tell them "I've got some
work to do for a few hours, so I'm going to go find a Starbucks and set up
station. Want to meet for a drink around <five hours from now>?" If the
priority is the latter, then embrace the distraction, spend some quality
time/activities with the person you've traveled to visit, and if you must
code, keep it to small discrete chunks like bugfixes or writing unit tests.

People complain about things like shading in Maven being complicated. What
they might not realize is that pip doesn't even try to address conflicting
dependencies, it will just silently give you the wrong version! You ask for
A==0.2 and it will give you A==0.1 if another dependency asked for A==0.1
first. And it won't even warn you even though it's straight up broken
behavior. Virtualenv makes packaging annoying since it's almost vendoring but
not quite. To totally understand the packaging system forces you into the
world of eggs, wheels, disutils, conflicting versions, condas, etc.

standard of dependency excellence when it's probably the worst overall
ecosystem of major languages.

Might I suggest a different route? How about you release what you have there
the same way all those libraries you base your work on were released. Trust
me, they are full of research that nobody knew would pay off, with things that
seem obvious in hindsight, but took many, MANY late nights of experimenting.

If what you're saying is true and your "novel ideas" and the solutions you've
found really are that valuable, then there is an incredible trove of respect
and admiration waiting for you. (And if you're smart, you will find ways to
convert that into "making a living".) You'd be robbing yourself of a huge
community (again, the same community that you are currently _using_ \-
bootstrap, jquery, threejs, modernizer etc.) cheering you on, respecting you
in the same way that you might have felt using those other public libraries.

The only thing you see at the moment is that you _have something_ and you
imagine that the thing you have should be the thing that pays your bills,
directly. So you have decided to close it down as much as you possibly can
(and, judging from the use of public, floss libraries, it's debatable how much
you actually can). I'm telling you there is another way. You could be "the
library" for people mixing 2D and 3D.

The path you're on right now only leads to one of two things: First, you're
going to go closed-source. Then somebody else will write a floss "the
library". Then you get angry and lawyer up. Then you realize that only the US
and a handful of other countries is idiotic enough to allow for patents on
software. Then you realize that trying to "go legal" is probably pointless.
Here, you are at a crossroads: On one side is the path I'm telling you to go
now, you're then just five years behind on where you could be now and somebody
else has earned all the admiration and respect. On the other side is an old
and bitter man, clutching his wallet.

To understand the effects of video games, one needs to go back to debriefings
conducted by the U.S. Army after WWII. Interviewing soldiers returning from
battle, researchers discovered a very disturbing fact. A significant number of
soldiers had been face to face with an enemy soldier, rifle in hand, enemy in
their sights, gun not jammed, and had _not fired_ . Something deep in their
being, some sort of innate humanity, had prevented them from actually pulling
the trigger.

Needless to say, this was very disturbing to the military. They began a
research effort to figure out what to do about this problem. They discovered
that in the heat of battle, under the incredible physical and psychological
stress of being faced with another human being you were supposed to kill, the
higher mental functions were largely absent. Under such conditions, the mind
reverts to much simpler modes of operation, to deeply wired, almost
instinctive behaviors. In other words, no amount of target practice at
bullseye targets and classroom lectures about how you're supposed to kill the
enemy had much effect when it counted.

Over the following decades and wars, the Army learned that the way to get
soldiers to reliably pull the trigger was to use very basic, repetitive
operant conditioning, along the lines of standard behaviorist theory. Now,
behaviorism provides a very poor model for how humans act in everyday life,
but it turns out to be a pretty good model for how humans act when they are
under stress and have to act quickly, and are responding primarily to fear.
Under stress, fearful people do what they have been conditioned to do.

The Army's solution was to replace dry target practice with realistic training
grounds, complete with pop-up targets, loud noises, smoke, stress, the works.
The goal was to condition the soldiers: If it moves, shoot it _now_ , don't
think about it. Repetition, repetition, repetition: Target pops up, you shoot.
Target pops up, you shoot. Do that often enough, and, research shows, next
time you see something pop up, you are more likely to shoot it, even if it's a
real human in a real battle. This is not just a theory, it is documented by
exit interviews from soldiers in later wars: The Army got what it wanted.

product promotion planned for after the release of Firefox 28, but that's no
longer in the cards.

In the absence of that, we have to rely on metrics from desktop Firefox (e.g.
what portion of our users are running it on the touch hardware that our Metro
app was designed for) and on any data we can get about the PC industry as a
whole.

I'm torn about this decision (understandably, I think), and I still think that
Microsoft has a good chance of eventually building a much larger user base for
its touch platforms. But the improvements we wanted to make to the Metro
browser (like making the scrolling as smooth as possible) would have required
ongoing work not just from my team but from other groups like the graphics and
layout teams, whose energy may be better used on other platforms (desktop,
Android, Firefox OS). So we had to think strategically about what's right for
us to ship this year.

Why do you still call it "Metro"?

~~~
mbrubeck
We used "Firefox for Metro" only as a code name for the project; it doesn't
appear in user-facing strings in the product.

We've been using that project name for a couple of years, and haven't seen a
good reason to change. Microsoft hasn't settled on a useable replacement. For
a while they used "Modern style" but now they've dropped that too. Now they
mostly use "Windows Store app" in their developer documentation, but we found
that too confusing, especially since Metro-enabled desktop browsers like
Firefox and Chrome aren't necessarily installed through the Windows Store.
Meanwhile, the Microsoft white paper on _" Developing a Metro-enabled desktop
browser"_ was retitled _" Developing a new experience enabled desktop
browser"_ [1], which is even less... wieldy.

The stats, character classes, etc. are strange. There is no reason why a game
should appear so complicated and require so much assumed knowledge.

Moreover, there seems to be way too much stuff to collect. And if keeping the
right stuff is important, it's not at all clear what the tradeoffs are.

The quests tend to be rather similar and are not much fun.

There's also too much grinding.

progression beyond games like chess, but they are not as fundamental as chess.

A: Right. That's why if your parents live in Belarus, you have to go to
another country, like Russia, to have an interview and then stay about a week
in a hotel, waiting for your passport. You can't go back to Belarus, because
they keep your passport at the embassy and not giving it back to you right
away, even if you passed interview and your visa was granted.

Q: Why did you apply for a new visa if your previous was issued only 2 months
ago?

A: Both L1 and L2 visas are linked to your blanket petition. Petition is
another document, issued by USCIS for 1 year. You can't get a visa, which
expiration date is longer than your petition expiration date. My petition was
approved in August 2012, but I received it in fact only in spring (after more
than 6 months). And then, when I received it, it took several more months to
make final preparations for the movement, so we were able to get a visa for
her only in June (which expired in August according to petition expiration)
and moved to the U.S. right away after that. And again, petition has been
extended already, but I only received it in August, even though it has been
extended since April.

He's saying that Apple betrayed trust by implementing secure feature
insecurely (while claiming that it was working correctly) and when they
decided to actually do something about it, they just quietly pulled out the
rug from under their users. There was no Apple announcement or apology. Just a
checklist item burying deep in a list of changes in an OS update. That's why
he says 'double betrayal.'

I fear we're both working from second (or third)-hand information here and
it's time to do some homework to find out the truth, but let me add this one
thought.

This may sound like a stretch, and Apple themselves have decided that it's not
sufficient, but while the files themselves my not be encrypted the filesystem
of the iPhone itself is protected from all but deliberate (and possibly
illegal) fiddling by third-parties. In this way it's not completely dishonest
for the iPhone's exchange client to report to the Exchange server that the
local files are secured.

Like I said it's a stretch, but perhaps the original implementation wasn't
pure malice/ignorance on Apple's part.

I'm looking into UE4 for my next game, too, and Mono is one of the reasons why

For instance, my game builds are ridiculously large, because you can't store
your textures in a losslessly compressed format (you can load from URL a png
manually, but then you have to manually apply them to your models).

Unity has been so successful because it's been an "OK" tool in a land of
rubbish. It seems as though it's finally getting some strong competition at a
comparable price point, which is great for everyone.

Either Unity will step its game up (which I'd love, I don't want to switch

Unity 4.3+ lets you choose "png" format as part of the native 2d support. No
more 16/24/32 bit uncompressed as the only lossless formats.

I'm not sure if the new "png" format would work for 3d textures though- there
might be some other weirdness there (like maybe you can't turn on mipmaps or
something) since it's supposed to be used for 2d sprites.

I'm not a lawyer. However, the amicus brief[1] is pretty good reading and
addresses your scenario above with a locked box, vault or safe. In those
instances, the "content" doesn't change (hence the decryption argument doesn't
apply here), but the method by which the lockbox is secured greatly matters
(page 13 of the brief):

 _" As the Supreme Court noted in Hubbell, the compelled entry of a safe’s
combination is testimonial because it requires the compelled use of the
“contents of [an individual’s] own mind” and is thus within the Fifth
Amendment’s privilege. [...] Meanwhile, the compelled production of a
lockbox’s key is not testimonial, because it involves “a mere physical act”."_

Thus, biometric data (i.e. the act of placing your face or finger near/on the
device to unlock) could be construed as a "mere physical act" as referenced in
the _U.S. vs. Hubbell_ Supreme Court case[2].

If that's true, it's ridiculous.

The issue at hand is that it's a 'locking mechanism' \- something that only

Whether it's biometric, a password, or a padlock - is basically irrelevant to

Functional Programming Is Worse Than Crap: State Changes Are Essential... - jashkenas
http://rebelscience.blogspot.se/2007/09/functional-programming-is-worse-than.html

======
colanderman
_What most FP theorists fail to explain is that, in FP, the function itself is
the variable. The variable value of functions are kept on the stack and are
used as arguments for other functions. One function affects another. Insisting
that there are no variables and thus no side effects in FP is wishful thinking
at best and crackpottery at worst._

The author is misunderstanding FP entirely; possibly due to FP zealots
misunderstanding FP entirely. The key to FP is not some abstract hand-wavy
idea of "stuff never changing", which is the strawman on which he built this
entire post. It is referential transparency (
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency_(compu...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency_\(computer_science\))
).

Referential transparency is the notion that any given expression can be
replaced with its value without changing the result of the program. This
property does wonders for formal verification since it allows programs to be
broken into pieces for ease of verification (this is a _huge_ win).

FP, by making all state explicit, trivially exhibits referential transparency
(since the dependencies of an expression are syntactically present within it).
Imperative languages, by making state implicit, do not exhibit this property.

A study languages which exhibit referential transparency yet have state, such
as Mercury or Flapjax, shows that state is not incompatible with referential
transparency or functional programming in the manner the author believes. A
solid understanding of reduction-semantics such as that used by the lambda
calculus would also help him form a more coherent argument (particularly the
points about "functions being variable" don't make logical sense).

No, the importance is massive, and you understate it. While we may all want to
just believe, the regulatory ecosystem worldwide (where it applies, esp. in
financial realm) demands that we provide explanations of why models made
certain decisions on certain data. Without this ability, models will not be
allowed to drive innovation or decisions in many areas of life, from financial
(credit and risk) to medical (recommendations for treatment) to legal (best
contract approach or best defense approach for a lawsuit).

Saying that humans make mistakes and cannot explain their decisions is, in
fact, one of the very reasons we want to have better models. We hope they will
do better than most people to create a better world. And their explanations
will hopefully provide insight into how we as people make good (and bad)
decisions.

And sure, we can change the laws over time, but having advanced models which
can allow humans to understand decisions and even provide diagnostics to
improve the models will be transformative. Until then, we will see massive
impact in some areas of our lives, and frustrating holdbacks in others, driven
either by the distraction of building for regulatory constraints or by
choosing not to build in regulated areas at all.

We know why these models make decisions on data. They're optimizing for lower
error rates.

The black box unveiled for a convolutional neural network is this: over the
course of several thousand rounds of performing the dot product of the RGB
values of a given training datum against a weight vector, this network has
determined that a weight vector containing _these values_ optimally reduce the
error produced by "squashing" the output matrices of said dot products in a
softmax function when the "squashed" value is compared against the pre-
determined true value.

If you would also like to be able to correctly predict whether a given input
is part of the class for which this model was optimized for, we suggest your
weight vectors also contain _these values_ as this will reduce the number of
false positives and false negatives you will produce from your prediction.

The company was founded around 1996. I assume he wrote it because there was no
easy way to develop for Win CE back then except for C++/MFC. It did allow the
company to hire a lot of cheap developers from well known but not well
respected private colleges.

The same code could also be used for the back end supporting services, but he
did at least add support for COM interop on the server so we could use any

After the device is connected, use looks like a key consistency aware system

To extract the device secret value, an attacker needs to connect the target

secret value over the untrusted channel. Impersonation of that device after
that moment is trivial as a result.

The entire cryptographic protocol is broken from the start.

If victin device is connected to attacker host, then only responses to
challenges are potentially leaked. That might allow active mitm, but not
cloning the key. That's the whole reason TFA needed to go poking around in
flash to get the keys.

Not saying that TB is the best security protocol in the universe, but as far
as I can tell the vulnerabilities exposed here are mostly implementation flaws
rather than protocol level issues.

is hard for the same reason it's hard on iTunes, which has no inventory
problem.

~~~
jrockway
Netflix doesn't even need to burn discs, they already have the video streaming
infrastructure in place.

The studios don't want people to watch their movies. They want people to pay
for the discs.

------
tlb
And? Of course popular movies are in high demand, so the rental queue is
longer. They avoid showing you movies that would cause a long wait.

The movies on Netflix's list are probably better than the new releases. In
fact, the real manipulation is the idea of new releases, that half the demand
should be for this season's movies. The actual best movies of all time are
probably not on this week's best sellers list. It's a Hollywood marketing
artifact: because buzz causes a superlinear advertising conversion rate, it
works best to promote movies in short bursts. New releases also skew revenue
from rental stores towards Hollywood (since rental stores have to buy enough
for peak demand) so you can't blame Hollywood for doing it.

After hacking on the netflix contest it was fun to sign up for netflix and
give the recommendation system a try. After putting in several hundred movies
I now typically only choose recommendations that it thinks I would rate a 4 or
5. Most are good and rank about what they think I will. This includes plenty
of older movies including some silent films which I absolutely loved after
seeing them where before I would have never even considered watching them. On
the flip side the brand new movie of the month that I _must see_ and added to
the top of my que I end up ranking much lower on average. So I would very much
agree, on a given week I don't want to watch the new dvd/movie that just came
out as it probably

Your argument is circular.

You're saying that we shouldn't talk about pay, because when we talk about pay
we get paid like Buffer devs do, which you think is obviously low compared to
other salaries, which we can't actually prove because _we don 't talk about
pay_.

It's a bit like telling someone that you're giving them $100 in a box, but not
to open the box, because if you open it, it'll turn into $20. "You can only
have a high salary if you have no way to verify that it's high." Even if true,
where does that leave us?

~~~
morgante
> which we can't actually prove because we don't talk about pay.

Just because salaries aren't public doesn't mean you can't get any salary
information. Just go on a few interviews, set up an auction, and see what you
can get.

> It's a bit like telling someone that you're giving them $100 in a box, but
> not to open the box, because if you open it, it'll turn into $20.

It's a cute analogy, but the more complete version would include a box market,
where other people with insight into the box market are interested in buying
the box I've been given. In such a scenario, I could shop around my box to see
what it's actually worth without having to open it up.

~~~
Lazare
I dunno, let's try the more complete version:

"There's $100 in this box. You can't open it, or look inside it, but trust me,
it's there. Now you need to go over to my mate George, and give him the box,
and he'll give you $100 for it. But only if you haven't opened it!"

Now it just sounds like you're being recruited as a drug mule. :)

Okay, granted, in your scenario their are multiple box dealers who are willing
to bid on your unopened-but-totally-contains-$100 box. If you work at it, it's
quite possible that you might even get some semblance of a fair offer. But
should you need to work at it? And this still feels like a system which lends
itself to collusion, uncertainty, and unfairness

    
    
      #include <stdchecked.h>
    
      void read_next(int *b, int idx, checked int *out) {
          int tmp = *(b+idx);
          *out = tmp;
      }

The problem here is you’re not writing C, you’re writing a language that kind
of resembles C but is nonportable. So you might as well just use a different,
memory safe language at that point.

~~~
chubot
I think you're missing an important point:

 _Checked C’s design is distinguished by its focus on backward-compatibility,
incremental conversion, developer control, and enabling highly performant
code_

The problem is that there is a huge body of decades-old C code out there that
we all depend on.

A typical Docker container with a web app contains maybe 10K lines of your own
code in Python/Ruby/JS, 100K lines of framework code, and 1M or 10M lines of C
code (i.e. the interpreter itself, the web server, SSL, the base image, etc.)

So I welcome new languages focused on incremental conversion.

That's what I'm doing with Unix shell:
[http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/28.html](http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/28.html)

I applaud projects like Corrode, a C to unsafe-Rust translator, although
undoubtedly they would have an easier time if Rust was designed in the first
place for conversion.

[https://github.com/jameysharp/corrode](https://github.com/jameysharp/corrode)

So Checked C seems like a great idea to me.

I've noticed that most programmers seem to wildly overestimate the rate at
which code gets rewritten. I think it's more accurate to say that code piles
up over time. And unfortunately when the foundations are unstable, what you
build on top is also unstable.

~~~
bluejekyll
There is also a new tool, c2rust, [https://c2rust.com](https://c2rust.com)
that I believe was inspired by Corrode.

Hack allows linux users to play OnLive games - riledhel

Karunamon
The slashdotters already got to this and eviscerated it in typical
"Proprietary anything is automatically bad" fashion.

I for one think this is awesome. You can play some cool things with online for
cheap if your system can't handle the latest and greatest.

~~~
wccrawford
I think it's a great idea, too, except for 2 things:

1) If you buy the game, you pay the same price as getting it at a store, but
with no recourse if the company goes under.

2) The video is pretty bad. It's 720p with a lot of lossy compression. I tried
it for one of the Lego games (which I'm quite familiar with on my consoles)
and it felt really fuzzy and indistinct. It wasn't a very pleasant experience.

I could forgive both of them if the games were cheaper, but they aren't. (And
can't be, really, since the game publishers aren't going to give them a
break... At least, not until they realize their DRM is unhackable.)

~~~
motdiem
Personally I've found two things great about onlive :

1/ It's an alternative to downloading demo - 30mn is enough to see if I like a
game, and saves me the hassle of downloading, installing/uninstalling etc - I
don't understand why every new game demo is distributed this way now

2/ Their $4 for a week-end rental - for a lot of games, this is enough for me
to play and get out of

Video quality is good for playing on a laptop - not on a gaming desktop.

Note though that many of the games on onlive are very aggressively discounted
on steam at every steam sale - so I usually end up buying them from steam
instead.

" One of the reasons I stayed at JPL for twelve years was that I was appalled
at what the software industry had become. The management world has tried to
develop software engineering processes that allow people to be plugged into
them like interchangeable components. The "interface specification" for these
"components" usually involves a list of tools in which an engineer has
received "training." (I really detest the use of the word "training" in
relation to professional activities. Training is what you do to dogs. What you
should be doing with people is educating them, not training them. There is a
big, big difference.)

To my mind, the hallmark of the interchangeable component model of software
engineers is Java. Without going into too many details, I'll just say that
having programmed in Lisp the shortcomings of Java are glaringly obvious, and
programming in Java means a life of continual and unremitting pain. So I vowed
I would never be a Java programmer, which pretty much shut me out of 90% of
all software engineering jobs in the late 90's."

Word, this needs to be seen for what it has turned into if we're ever going to
get out. I've tried every kind of paid software dev setup, it's all abusive
business bullshit these days.

I like the 'life wars', that's a clever one.

I'll raise your glider one f-pentomino.

Set it up so that you only have to agree to the number of life cells you can
both place, as soon as the last cell is placed the game fires and runs to
completion.

Two sliders, starting at 50 cells or so, both players can lower the slider as
long as the cells have not been all places. Each player sets a cell to their
colour in turn.

Excellent little idea, it won't make you any money in the short run but it has
a fair chance of going viral.

Core wars for life.

Really neat little idea.

edit: and now the Hacker News variation on this, set it up so there is an API
where hackers can pit their skills against each other, a sort of face off
arena for cellular automaton placement strategies.

There is your machine learning angle.

For extra points provide a schedule and a way for spectators to follow the
action.

I'd help you build it / host it :)

~~~
project_idea
Thanks, these are very nice ideas, especially the API for agents. I'd like to
build this sometime, as it should be really fun to play... There are some
issues in gameplay that I couldn't figure out yet, though. for example running
until completion could be quite hard to detect, as there can be oscillators
with a long period. Also, not sure if the board should be circular, to allow
re-entry or not... I was thinking whether players can place their cells
anywhere or just in their own restricted "corners" of the board. My main
concern however is whether the whole thing would be predictable enough to
allow some sort of strategy or it would just be too chaotic... I also sent you
a private message if you'd like to discuss...

No cells live or die in x generations = end of game.

Anywhere, one after the other.

gnarcoregrizz
So this is like a decentralized keybase? Are the identities and associated
public keys stored in a decentralized manner? It wasn't clear to me when I
registered an identity, because I figured if it's decentralized, then I would
have to pay for it in some manner with a cryptotoken. I always thought this
would be a good use case for Ethereum (and indeed, there seem to be a few
projects working on it). It would be extra cool if it could integrate into
existing wallet/dapp software so you don't need to juggle extra keys. Anyway,
cool stuff. I'm hoping more people adopt end to end encryption

edit* looks like the identities are stored in a decentralized manner, and that
all of this should integrate with blockstack's keychain and browser

~~~
prabhaav
Yes, the blockstack node package running on your machine generates the key
pairs for you and thus the keys are stored on your local machine, not a
centralized authority.

The reason you need an .id is because we have to register your identity on the
blockchain and propagate your zonefiles.

We can help you register a .stealthy.id that gives you access to the tool if
you create an account today :)

------
kodablah
Pardon my Blockstack ignorance, but are keys deterministically created via
some kind of KDF w/ some factors I provide or are the users expected to handle
key management? IMO the latter significantly restricts adoption, especially in
a multi-device-same-identity world.

~~~
prabhaav
Users have to back up a 12-word mnemonic phrase, a la BIP39. We also email
users an encrypted copy of their phrase (where their password is the key)

~~~
kodablah
I think email is a reasonable place to do this since it's one of the few
storage places people keep around across devices (sadly, other services with
no centralization at all can't easily send SMTP). Could also consider a
printable QR code I guess. I assume the Blockstack browser or whatever makes
it easy

offered two alleged instances of US snooping in the 1990s, which he says
followed the newly-elected Clinton administration's policy of "aggressive
advocacy" for US firms bidding for foreign contracts. The first came from a
Baltimore Sun report which said the European consortium Airbus lost a $6bn
contract with Saudi Arabia after NSA found Airbus officials were offering
kickbacks to a Saudi official. The paper said the agency "lifted all the faxes
and phone-calls between Airbus, the Saudi national airline and the Saudi
Government" to gain this information. Mr Campbell also alleges that the US

contract to supply a radar system to Brazil instead of France's Thomson-CSF.

You clearly misunderstood the article

At startup school they talked about (presumably VC backed) startups being a
%15 chance of success. IF you have a %15 chance of building a company worth
$20M in 2 years, and you'll get $2M of that-- then the opportunty value is
0.15X2M or $300,000.

On the other hand, if you bootstrap, and you build the same business, your
chances of being a success go up to %60 (No flatline VC sitting on your board
forcing bad decisions) but maybe you spend a bit less on marketing and grow
more organically (really, I'm being generous here- I think the same business
would grow just as fast bootstrapped.) so you end up being worth $10M in two
years. Your share of that is $5M, for an opportunity value of $3,000,000.

In other words, you're likely to return ten times the money by forgoing
venture capital.

While in both cases you could end up with nothing, weighting the payoff with
the likihood of success lets you evaluate two very different opportunities.

If you take the choice tht has a %15 chance of success, odds are you won't get
that first million... where as in the alternative, odds are you _will_.

The biggest problem most founders have in the beginning is just being able to
devote undivided attention to it. If you have to work a full-time job and do
your startup on the side for the first 1-2 years that's a huge disadvantage
and it massively deceases your chances of success.

If you have something good and don't need a lot of money there's no reason you
have to put yourself at the mercy of VCs -- you can maintain control.

You can't judge this kind of thing in a vacuum. What kind of scenario are you
thinking of?

Project Oberon Emulator in JavaScript and Java - cylinder714
http://schierlm.github.io/OberonEmulator/

======
david-given
For me, on Chrome Linux, typing into the editors is a bit problematic because
pressing BACKSPACE navigates away from the emulator.

There was a copy of Oberon for Linux bundled on my original Infomagic CD set
back in the 90s. I played with it a bit, but without documentation there
wasn't much I could do, and it was closed source and so doomed to die.

To me, Oberon looks like the Wirth version of Kay's Smalltalk system, where
they both developed an all-in-one GUI system, from scratch, with completely
different philosophies. It be interesting to do a detailed comparison of how
they differ and why...

~~~
dirkt
There was a link to a paper giving a retrospective on Oberon on HN some days
ago, and that made me want to play around with it. After trying an older now
unsupoorted variant from the ETH site which segfaulted, I downloaded Oberon
Linux Revival ([http://oberon.wikidot.com/](http://oberon.wikidot.com/)), and
it worked for me. All files are kept in a single directory, and this includes
the complete source (.Mod files), so you can browse these from Linux after
dealing with the line endings (e.g. convert \r to \n using tr). There's no
native Linux source, everything is written in Oberon. X11 is surprisingly
accessed using the wire protocol directly.

Actually, about half of the Oberon system must even be compiled first (using
the "recipe" in OLR.Gadgets.Tool) before these programs can be used in Oberon.
There's also documentation in form of a "book" (Desktops.OpenDoc Book.Tool)
which explains the system on various levels, including the Oberon language.

The font size turned out to be too small on my screen (because the bitmapped
screen fonts where made for different hardware), and the fonts are hardlinked
from the documents, so I shuffled the *.Scr.Fnt files about two sizes down and
everything was readable. I also replaced Default.Pal with Light.Pal

People tend to overestimate how much work can they do in the short run, but
vastly underestimate how much can they in longer timespan. This means you
should simply start doing whatever you have at hand, and do it again and
again. Start accumulating knowledge and skills and finished side projects.

You say yourself you're interested in many things; take notes when you're
working, so it takes you less time to resume your work later. It will still
take a lot to resume work, especially if the field is completely different
from what you were doing lately. Maybe at some point you'll decide to narrow
your focus, so switching becomes easier; maybe you'll get better at switching
context; maybe you'll just get used to this.

You can't gain expert level in _everything_ , so you must accept that you'll
leave some fields out. But don't let it prevent you from learning any of them.

After two or three years you'll see real progress, and after five you'll be
amazed how much have you done.

This is a tough one for me. I tend to take pet projects just to the point
where I know they're doable and feasible and it's just a question of
performing the "brainless" work.

Instead of sticking with it and finishing them completely.

I think it's about prioritising what could have the biggest impact to your
life and being honest with yourself as to what you want to get out of it.

I have now allocated time for "intellectual exercises" but I don't kid myself
that I'm doing these for my career. And if I find a justifiable angle for it
to benefit my professional career I make sure I put in place the steps to
promote it on my résumé, blog etc.

Sometimes you need a break or have 'writer's block' and can play with some

No. Pompey wanted political power just as much he wanted military power. He
was able to wield the second, but never really the first. That was mainly due
to his rivalry with Crassus first and Caesar second.

He just wasn't at the right time in the right place. Crassus, despite being an
inferior general, was richer than him and had more influence in the Senate.
Caesar initially had less political influence than him, but he was superior on
the battlefield.

If that was the case, then why did he not just run the Senate out of town when
he returned from the East after clearing the Mediterranean of Pirates and
finishing off Mithridates? He was extremely popular with the people and the
Army. Right before the civil wars with Caesar started, he was preparing for a
virtual retirement with his appointment as governor of Spain. The governorship
was to give him a steady source of income.

Yes, he was extremely popular because he was a skilled general. He had a very

but surely on the top-10 of the best Roman generals of all time.

> If that was the case, then why did he not just run the Senate out of town

That wasn't possible. The Roman Senate and the whole Roman political scene was
in complete stagnation. Plus, you couldn't really "run the Senate" remotely –
many tried (including Caesar) doing so, none succeeded. You had to have a
physical presence or to delegate (e.g. Caesar with Mark Anthony).

At the time, Pompey had strong political power and run for Console, but on his
way to power, he found Crassus with the very same goal in mind. The problem is
that Crassus was the richest man in Rome (a billionaire compared to today) and
he had much more political influence.

Pompey (mainly because of Crassus's obstructionism) wasn't able to fully
capitalize on his military success.

Caesar well understood that the stagnation was mainly due to the
Crassus/Pompey (personal) rivalry and offered them to run himself for Console,

Ok, so lets say you did that. Do you have a hypothesis about what might be

College is actually reasonably affordable, there are accredited four year
university degrees that cost about $25K over four years. Generally those are
'state' schools but still $25K it what it costs to buy a car, so if one can
choose between buying a car and going to school we could do some interesting
comparisons there.

In every survey I've ever seen, whether it was done by the Census bureau or
the chamber of commerce, people with college degrees were more likely to have
better economic success than someone who had not completed college. The
numbers are quite skewed toward college graduates with STEM [1] degrees.

By and large, today, for the general case, if you want to increase your
chances for economic success, getting a STEM degree from an accredited college
is your most highly leveraged investment.

The median household income in the US is $49k, I believe. 40% of households

It's quite obvious that when you decriminalize something, the crime rate will
go down, since the people doing that thing are not criminals any more. (n / m)
< (n - 1) / m.

But even apart from that (because it's a cooking-the-books level trick,
really), decriminalization of drug use has other effects that lower crime
rates. For example: keeping up a heroin habit is hard when you need to pay
black market rates (€100 / $150 per day). So often, these people need to
resort to burglary, robberies or prostitution. Regulating the market drives
the prices way down (you could have retail prices for a brick of coke that are
the same as that of a package of coffee if you'd let the market work
unrestrained), which causes people to not have to resort to crime to fund
their habits.

Figure 1d in the linked-to paper illustrates the difference between high

To quote from the paper (where k = # of edges a node has): "We start by
removing all nodes with degree k = 1. After removing all the nodes with k = 1,
some nodes may be left with one link, so we continue pruning the system
iteratively until there is no node left with k = 1 in the network. The removed
nodes, along with the corresponding links, form a k-shell with index kS = 1.
In a similar fashion, we iteratively remove the next k-shell, kS = 2, and
continue removing higher k-shells until all nodes are removed. As a result,
each node is associated with a unique kS index, and the network can be viewed
as the union of all k-shells."

Keeping existing nuclear plants for as long as possible, while the next
generation of nuclear plants is being actively developed, is a sane choice for
any country, but especially for Japan.

Of course, I can see the incredulous voices "How can you say that, when in

is still zero. Compare that to the death toll from pollution, if Japan had
built coal plants instead of nuclear plants all those decades. For numbers,

The pause in nuclear power plant caused a steep rise in oil import, some
alternative energy (And probably cause a huge commercial deficit for japanese
international trade). Even if right now the japanese are trying to reduce
their consumption, by approx 15%, it won't be sufficient on the long term for
the japanese industry to remain competitive. I am already seeing big japanese
company de-localizing. In the building where I work (in japan), they installed
solar panels on the roof, but these panel only provide like less than 10% of
the power need in the best case ( and even less for the rest of the day, and
it is not like we use high powered laser, nor particle collider).

_vendors are locking down their tablets and phones right now, without any
Microsoft help - where's the public outcry?_

There's a difference between a hardware manufacturer voluntarily choosing to
lock down its own hardware (which is bad), and an independent operating system
vendor forcing hardware manufacturers to lock down their hardware (which is
anticompetitive).

Besides, there's plenty of outcry about locked-down phones and tablets, which
is why HTC announced that they are no longer locking the bootloader on their
devices.

jimbobimbo
Look, Microsoft does not prohibit Samsung selling their Galaxy Tab with
whatever Samsung wants to ship. They prohibit Samsung selling their Galaxy Tab
with Windows 8 ARM pre-installed on it. This - tablet AND Windows 8 - is a ONE
product, hence you cannot divide h/w vendor and OS vendor. This is as simple
as that. Samsung is free to not to ship tablets with Windows 8 ARM - how is
that anti-competitive?

ARM devices are not supposed to be fiddled with by customers in their current
state, PCs are. This business model is a status quo right now, like it or not,
and Microsoft plays by the rules. The game is different in PCs and Microsoft
has a different position on lockdown there.

~~~
nitrogen
There are two critical differences between Microsoft's lockdown and the status
quo of the ARM tablet market:

1\. The status quo in the tablet market is for hardware manufacturers to
_decide_ whether to lock down their boot loader. Microsoft (who is not a
hardware manufacturer) would _force_ hardware manufacturers to lock the boot
loader of any ARM devices running Windows 8.

2\. Not all ARM devices are tablets and phones. ARM-based netbooks (i.e.
miniature general-purpose PCs) have been available for a long time, and
there's an expectation that you can install whatever OS you want on a general-
purpose PC. Microsoft's ARM lockdown rules (as quoted on the previous HN
discussion of the subject) would apply to devices that people expect to be
able to customize.

Technologies such as this one, that that do not threaten dentists' incomes,

We are promised a caries vaccine "real soon now". That is to say we are in the
same situation we were 30 years ago: no tooth decay vaccine but plenty of
promises. Isn't (dental) science wonderful!

The idea isn't that a group is paid vs unpaid.

Salary, in this case, is not the type of incentive we're talking about. Having
a decent salary is just to get the employee willing to work - not as an
incentive to work at max capacity.

What we're talking about, really, is already past salary: is a group of fairly
paid people more efficient and creative when motivated financially (say, by
extra bonuses or salary increases) or by promises of autonomy (say, 20% time).

Thus, the candle problem, when placed in the real world, would have three
groups: a control group which is paid 'decently and fairly', and a group that
is paid 'decently and fairly' and is given financial incentives beyond that,
and a group that is payed 'decently and fairly' and is given autonomy as an
incentive.

Release them next week or next month. This makes your customers think that you
are actively developing your product and that there is momentum behind your
product."

This statement really irks me, not just as a programmer, but as a consumer. I
initially thought the article might be a little joke, but since the other tips
were more reasonable, I have to assume that it is serious. I can understand
holding back features in your initial release, but there are much better
reasons than those that were cited. To purposely trick your potential users
seems to me to be a bad business model, and smells of the corporate mindset of
money and growth over all else. I think it is important to remember that the
whole point of developing a product is to fulfill a need (or want) of the
customer, and I think that as the average consumer gets more intelligent,
these types of tactics will be more transparent and will do more harm than
good to the startup.

As for better reasons for holding back features:

1\. In any interesting piece of software, I would imagine that there are
potentially hundreds of features which could be added. The difficult problem
is deciding when to be (temporarily) content with what you have and release.
Thus, some desired features must be left out in order to avoid the
perfectionist mindset, where nothing ever gets released.

2\. A mostly-implemented feature may work correctly most of the time, but fail
mysteriously at other times. Even with a beta release, it's probably best to
avoid these types of features which only serve to make your product less
reliable.

3\. A feature may be fully-implemented, but there may be no clear way to
integrate it into the UI. In this case, it would probably be best to hold off
and drop hints of the feature to beta testers, who could give their feedback
on how best to integrate it. After all, the feature is meant for the users to
actually use, isn't it?

4\. A feature may add computational complexity to the software which may be
overly taxing on the initial hardware that a startup company is using. Improve
the hardware before adding the feature, or better yet, improve the code which
implements the feature.

Am I being overly idealistic? Am I alone in thinking that the proposed

stack dm-crypt and any file system (including OCFS2) on top. As far as I know,
drbd only supports 2 nodes, though, which kind of limits the appeal.

(I'm specifically _not_ talking about tunneling a normal cluster file system
via SSL, which only provides end-to-end encryption)

These articles that describe how to "build your own dropbox" all ignore the
client. For me, the beauty of dropbox is the simple, straightforward client.
Backing up on my own hardware/cloud might be interesting, but not if I have to
monkey around with shell scripts in a CLI.

When someone reverse-engineers the dropbox protocol so I can use the official
dropbox client on my own infrastructure THAT will be news.

As someone inside the music industry, this comes as no surprise. The spotlight
of the attempts of anti-piracy actions on the part of the big four and rights
groups overshadows the actions of the individuals working at these companies
and the others in the industry. Not everyone in these companies agrees with
what the rights groups and major labels/studios are doing, or see it as case

The first rule of leadership is to be willing to do what you ask of others.

The stink of hypocrisy is to ask others to do what you are unwilling to do

I am sure all of the companies involved have a "no piracy" company policy on
their books with severe penalties (probably reprimands leading to dismissal on
repeated offenses). If they are unwilling to enforce their own policies on
their own employees, they are being hypocrites, not leaders.

Article text:

Several headlines on HackerNews (HN) have caught my attention recently
regarding weekend project. Here're some examples:

* My weekend project: MongoDB implementation in Ruby

* Show HN: my weekend project, Imagestash - a bookmarklet+ for image collectors

* Show HN: My 15 minute project: PimpMySalary.com

The last one is what made me write this post. Can you really build a website
in 15 minutes? The purpose of the projects mentioned is not of importance and
I am not trying to criticise the work accomplished. What I am curious about is
did it really take 15 minutes or even a weekend to create these projects?

It takes months or years to learn programming language, databases,
networking... Frameworks, apis, and modern programming language makes it easy
to develop but you still need to learn about them. It may have taken just the
weekend to build the project but it doesn't include all the initial learning.
That is my problem. It makes it sound so easy to develop an app or a website
when actually it requires a lot of effort.

Also ideas need to mature and it may take several days

This, the Parallel Construction story, and the Patriot act having been
principally used for the War on Drugs than terror... has made me consider that
the War on Drugs may actually be more dangerous to Liberty than the war on
terror.

No doubt it's basic premise, that putting a substance into one's own body is a
"crime", is a pernicious lie.

The War on Terror's pernicious lie is twofold: Terrorism isn't a crime, and
thus isn't subject to any laws, that this war is eternal, and the whole world
is a battlefield.

Certainly in practical effects the Drug war is worse: Minorities whose
communities are regularly raided by soldiers, depopulated, and placed into our
glorious, humane prison system with the highest incarceration rate in the
world, than stripped of voting rights and essentially blackballed from
employment afterwards, would think surely so...

My natural tendency has so far been to see the war on Terror as worse, this
may be me I, like many HNers with dissident political opinions, am more likely
to see myself as an actual target in the War on Terror. That, and being an
Orwell fan...

The Economist rants on this every couple of months, and I couldn't agree more.

The war on drugs is a terrible misstep. Drugs should never have been a

too entrenched to make that change now.

I'm using TPG and I can confirm access to www.globalcapitalwealth.com is still
working so I'd say "believed to be major telco TPG" is quite... um...
believable. www.globalcapitalaustralia.com is going to the GoDaddy holding
page so I'd say they're in the process of packing up shop.

I'm frankly disgusted at the underhandedness of Conroy. He has previously
pushed completely unfeasible schemes aiming at mandatory filtering. He caved
on this due to _huge_ public backlash, so he just re-interprets section 313 of
the telco act to give the AFP the power, if not the obligation, to bully
Australian ISPs into mandatory filtering anyway.

The main differences now are that he gets to do it quietly, possibly without
the public backlash, and secondly, that the cost for the extra infrastructure
and personnel required to implement it is now the sole burden of the ISPs, and
not the Australian taxpayer.

Unfortunately, with the current state of Australian politics, this mob are
_still_ probably the best choice going. The Greens (although I usually vote
for them, idealist that I am) really don't have any chance this election, and
the Liberals [1], except to say that they'd cut the investment in the National
Broadband Network, aren't even providing their usual hodge-podge of
regurgitated conservatism; They're happy watching Julia Gillard lose the
election on her own merits. The two Liberal party members to keep an eye on
here are Tony Abbott [2], and Malcolm Turnbull [3]. They, between them, have
the power to either lose or win (in that order) this election for the Liberal
party.

So, we in Australia, like many in the USA, are discovering that the more
"progressive" party is just as likely to engage in shady behaviour as their
"conservative" counterparts, but have more to lose when they're found out.
This reminds me of something I read recently [4] where it was stated that
trust is bi-directional. The more a government stops trusting the people it's
mandated to represent, the more those same people, in turn, stop trusting
their elected government.

The game engine, yes. The game itself? Not a chance.

I think you are seriously underestimating the complexity of a game. This would
be possible, but as a major open-source project.

Replacing the game engine would be a big undertaking, but it's doable. People
did just that with Frontier: First Encounters
([http://www.frontierastro.co.uk/Hires/glffe.html](http://www.frontierastro.co.uk/Hires/glffe.html)).
The game binaries is run as is, but modified to hook into the new engine.

Using FlightGear is not the same thing. It would be difficult, if not
impossible, to get the same feel of the original game. However, this would be
perfect for a remake, where the original experience is not expected.

Contrary to what the article states, what Falcon 3.0 focused on wasn't the

I don't know about playing the original Elite with a 3D HMD, but if you don't

one, there's an open source Elite remake, somewhat infelicitously called
Oolite [1], which could probably be extended to support the Oculus Rift.

There's also something called "Elite: Dangerous", which is a massively
multiplayer Elite-style game-to-be, and which appears already to offer Oculus
Rift support in its current combat alpha [2].

While this is a very cool sport and the armor is very nice, I think it is
important to point out unfortunately the techniques these guys use are not
historically sound. Historical manuals such as the German Fechtbücher clearly
describe how to fight in and out of armor (harnischfechten and blossfechten)
and what these guys do is neither. This is for the simple reason that the
harnischfechten would still be lethal and blossfechten ineffective. If you see
a "reenactment" or movie and people are swinging sword against someone wearing
armor, they are "doing it wrong" from a historical perspective.

I think its interesting that something like BoN, which is like SCA on
methamphetamines, gets so much attention when actual martial arts events such
as Swordfish are ignored by the media.

There are a wide variety of active martial arts groups, and each one has to
find its own balance in various ranges: fun, safety, historical accuracy,
thresholds to participation (cost of equipment, time to become competent) and
ongoing costs (equipment, travel, practice time).

The BotN techniques are heavily influenced by the origins of this particular
organization - most of the earliest teams come from Russia, Ukraine, and
Belarus.

Since many US team members are in their 40s (average age 37) and are competing
with generally younger opponents, one of the concerns was to look for medical
insurance policies or riders that covered the risks of this martial activity.

Getting attention or coverage seems more like a matter of making contacts and
offering images and narratives that appeal to the producers of media - in a
world that contains professional wrestling and other forms of "reality" TV,
finding a hook for a story can be more

There's an easily understandable intuitive understanding of the 1st
eigenvector (for the eigenvalue == 1) of the pagerank matrix (loosely
speaking: assuming you browse a-la the pagerank matrix, the ith component of
the (unit) eigenvector for the 1.0 eigenvalue is ~the same as lim n->infinity
of #(of visits to i-th page on the internet)/n; some details are getting
blurred (of course) but it's a helpful intuitive explanation).

Does anyone have any insight into intuitive interpretations of the
eigenvectors fpr the eigenvalues < 1? I'm drawing blanks.

(Edited: to be clear, I understand what the linked algorithm is doing and I
think it is very clever, and I am not surprised that it works reasonably well
for finding similar topics on wikipedia. I'm just at a blank for what it means
to say that 'the i-th component of the (unit) eigenvector for the k-th largest
eigenvalue is X'.)

I would reccomend looking at 'Proto Value Functions' (
[http://www.machinelearning.org/.../070_ProtoValue_Mahadevan....](http://www.machinelearning.org/.../070_ProtoValue_Mahadevan.pdf)
)[1]; they use eigenvectors of adjaceny matrices for reinforcement learning
--- but because gridworld has a simple adjacency martix, the resulting
eigenvectors are somewhat human-readable, and the pictures help a lot. If
you're really curious, I can probably bang up some python or MATLAB or
something.

The essential intuition is that higher numbered eigenvectors represent more
_local_ adjacency information --- so the first eigenvector deals with global
connectivity (the relative value of i-th and j-th component says something
about how interconnected nodes i and j are in terms of the whole graph). A
higher eigenvalue's corresponding vector has a higher local gradient, and the
direction of the gradient is less constant across the graph (there is not
necessarily a monotonic path from node to node) so says less about global
connectivity --- but has a higher granularity when examining local
connectivity.

I think using it as a safe battery is a neat idea. I understand there are
significant losses as compared to li-ion batteries, but the fact that the
system has a longer lifespan is really interesting.

It's a way to preserve energy during surplus. As a gardener I'm constantly
balancing inputs and outputs. A huge tomato harvest eaten raw off the vine is
the most efficient use.

But during a huge glut, I cannot eat the tomatoes fast enough so I start
freezing tomatoes and produce sauce.

I trade energy, and human time and labor to extend the shelf life of the
tomato.

In this sense, from my naive perspective, A hydride fluid battery if cheap
enough to build/install would be a great way to store surplus energy from
solar / wind / etc.

~~~
asgeirn
Love the tomato analogy - exactly why you need to convert energy, even with
the efficiency loss.

------
_ph_
The article names it, but then does not dive deeper into it: the hydrogen
chain has huge energy losses. First, electrolysis unfortunately has not a high
efficiency - I have read numbers around 70%, but then the compression of the
produced hydrogen takes a lot of energy, as compressing gases heats them up.
Then the hydrogen has to be transported and stored, requiring further energy.
Finally, you have to use the hydrogen, there the efficiency varies between 60%
(fuel cell) or as proposed in the article with a combustion engine as low as
30%.

At the same time, there are less and less applications which cannot be powered
by electricity directly, having only a fraction of losses compared to the
equivalent hydrogen chain. So as long we do not have more than 100% reneweable
electricity generation, we should be very concerned about the efficiency of
our energy usage.

Dual SIM phones are big sellers in developing countries, so add another $1 for

out there, although very useful in my experience, but many if not most of
these people will be on prepaid plans and without phone credits at times. The
dual SIMs let users leverage different promotional calling/texting structures
to reduce costs. As well, data for prepaid users is purchased in blocks of
data size or time, so being able to switch off the connection to one SIM or
the other offers another cost management tool.

The operator licensing requirements seem a bit onerous. What the hell does the

pj_mukh
"How do I get my algorithm FAA certified for flight?"

This one is critical. Most drone operators using anything above a hobby grade
UAV are using fairly sophisticated software to command GPS velocities. This is
assuming even more complex GPS missions are not being carried out. How do we
setup a certification regiment for that software and its extensions to sense
and avoid?

Granted, I don't have the answers. The FAA will inevitably suggest the same
certification regiment that large airplane autopilots go through, but that
seems prohibitively cumbersome.

~~~
cmurf
A large airplane operating on autopilot with two pilots in the cockpit is not
operating autonomously. Autonomous implies no pilot at all, that is, you
merely tell the UAS some set of commands like "go to this address, confirm
recipient and their order, hand over the goods, return to base". The person
interacting with this autonomous UAS is akin to an operations manager for an
airline. They are not a pilot. Eventually it may not even be a person, that
too could be software that just sequences a bunch of errands to the nearest
available UAS.

What's actually required by an autonomous system is closer to a large
percentage of FAR 61 and FAR 91, which are pilot certification and general
operating rules, respectively. Your very basic recreational or private pilot
conforms to both of those sets of regulations on every visual flight. For
instrument flights requiring positive separation from air traffic control
because the pilot can't see and avoid themselves? That's another layer of
regulations and conformance. For charter flights, that's FAR 135 a whole
separate set of regs. For commercial passenger flights, that's FAR 121 yet
another separate set of regs.

Track down a FAR/AIM manual and start reading FAR 61, 91, 135 and the AIM
part. A bulk of this needs to be incorporated

IMHO this is one of those edge cases where software might simplify the process
99 times out of 100, but a skilled/experienced human may help avoid uncommon
but costly mistakes. There is enough nuance and vagueness in taxes that it
pays to have a human look over your numbers -- even if they use software to do
it.

to collect my food but when I got there the person working asked me if I was

Javascript was used beyond it's own merits as a language. It was the only

If javascript goes the ecosystem goes too.

In real applications we need to use social login, share, google maps, shopify
buy SDK, S3, Azure speech API and so on. The javascript tools to access all of
that are plain old ES5 at best. How will we use them from another language?

Libraries, too. Are we going to find ourselves writing our own custom

This is the reason there are next to none real world examples of web apps made

I've read this petition three times and I still have no idea what happened.
Also, what in the holy fuck is the author thinking giving everyone enough

The difference between me and whoever the person advocating for this guy is,

a false name after being banned, his grand total of one day being a member of
Hacker Dojo, and completely omitting the attorney that he retained privately

perspective on raising a legal defense).

OK, Backed. I like tools like this. I think too often they get cluttered down
trying to implement the rules system in the game.

I don't want that, I don't need that. That's what the GM is for, and trying to
implement the rules themselves mean I need to program, in order to run my
game.

I just want an extension of my minis map, on the web. I'd like to click-and-
drag to move figures around, scribble on stuff, and maybe import some PNGs if
I feel motivated.

Or not. My scribbles are good enough, since you have VIDEO of me, right there,
describing it.

Again, this is where people get lost.

Things don't need to stand alone, like they would in Diablo, or Baulder's
gate. I don't want to spend a long time mapping out a dungeon before we play,
I want to fire up a game, and wing it as we all play together.

That's what I love about Tabletop games. As a GM, I can just use my marker,

VF2 is faster than Nauty for EXTREMELY trivial problems (and many problems are
extremely triial), but I've found many real-world problems where it falls off
a cliff.

VF2 is basically the most stupid search imaginable -- if the problem is easy
it stumbles into the solution very quickly, but if any work is required it
degrades into a horrible exponential search.

On the other hand, Nauty is very difficult to confuse -- as it reasons about
the whole graph (whereas VF2 just does local reasoning), your graph has to
have global properties which make it hard, which are rare (and basically never
occur in real-world graphs, unless they come from some mathematical problem).

I would love to know whether there are some practical (non-math/cs-user

Sure, there's a lot you can do with it in the math and theoretical cs world,
probably in chemistry (derivation of chemical reactions?) and maybe
bioinformatics as well.

But despite the power of the approach - general comparison of structures
and/or combinatoric enumeration of all "instances" of pattern in data graph -
are there any success stories of companies with products which are killing it
because of using graph morphisms under the hood? (or maybe even directly

The major use I know of is finding symmetries in other search problems.

Take your problem in Constraint Programming / Mixed Integer Programming / SAT
/ SMT, generate a parse tree, turn that parse tree into a graph, and find
symmetries of that graph.

If done in the right way, symmetries of the graph are symmetries of the
original problem, and knowledge of these symmetries can be used to avoid
redundant symmetric search. This is done all the time in combinatorial search
systems.

One problem for many other real-world problems is it is much more common to
want "almost symmetries" (for various definitions of almost symmetry). It
turns out this is a much harder problem, and algorithms for "pure" graph
isomorphism can't be easily modified, to solve the 'almost

afoul of existing laws. It's possible Google believes they are not "recording"
the call when they send audio to and from their AI.

They may be _transcribing_ calls to text, which arguably isn't "call
recording", it is just writing down verbatim what was said in the call. They
likely have enough voice data from other sources, like Google Assistant on
people's phones and Google Home that they can avoid recording calls
explicitly.

What I learned trying to log wall - wtbob
http://tilde.club/~phooky/logging_wall.html
======
rahimiali
interestingly, soda.csua.bekeley.edu had logging by 1993. and the mechanism? a
complete rewrite of wall as the redundantly named wallall, which wrote to a
log file right after it wrote to all the ttys. that way there was no need to
snarf a pty just to log.

and by the way, i don't agree that it's ok to log any public stream just
because it's public. some public media don't feel like a medium of record, and
invite an informal behavior that their users would regret if they knew they
were being logged. if i knew everything i'd say in public could be held
against me forever, i'd say very different things.

~~~
schoen
Wasn't there something with the username of the log file being named after
Larry Wall? Or the account that you finger to read it? Because his last name
was also Wall?

plot was somehow thicker than I realized.

I've been developing a FAQ on language learning as this interest is mentioned
on Hacker News from time to time. The article kindly submitted here mentions
learning French in France by a (native?) speaker of English who had previously
learned Spanish. All of those are Indo-European languages, more or less
cognate with one another. I've taken on some tougher language-learning
challenges over the years. As I learned Mandarin Chinese up to the level that
I was able to support my family for several years as a Chinese-English
translator and interpreter, I had to tackle several problems for which there
is not yet a one-stop-shopping software solution.

I hope the FAQ information below helps hackers achieve their dreams. For ANY
pair of languages, even closely cognate pairs of West Germanic languages like
English and Dutch, or Wu Chinese dialects like those of Shanghai and Suzhou,
the two languages differ in sound system, so that what is a phoneme in one
language is not a phoneme in the other language.

But to support multiple apps deliverable from a single subdomain, you would
need to specify the sitemap's URL in some webpage, perhaps as an attribute to
some HTML element. So each sitemap would be a sort of Manifest which controls
the Cache for an app.

By the way, the app's cache obviously ought to be isolated from other apps'
caches, right? Especially if you let the user grant an enlarged cache as a
per-app permission. And the user might want to clear the miscellany browser
cache without clearing the app cache, so we had better give this Application
Cache a distinct name.

That's a decent point about clearing the cache - it should be distinct from
flushing assets indicated for offline use. That distinction could be drawn by
determining whether or not each asset was served with stale-if-error.

We use a similar strategy for our HTML5-based IOS app, however the issue is
that it might take a few seconds to realize that an error has occurred and the
resource should be served stale, which pretty obnox
