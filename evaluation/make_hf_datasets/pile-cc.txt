Paranormal Activity suffered from being regarded as either incredibly boring or weird and somewhat tense until everything comes to a head at the end. Insidious on the other hand, had a very strong and refreshingly scary feel to it that took a major nosedive in the third act. Sinister manages to maintain a consistent tone to its horror that builds over time…you know, like a proper movie should. It never quite reaches the heights of terror that either movie achieved when at their best, but is a strong effort that’s overall enjoyable.

Of all the characters involved, the most intriguing is easily Ellison Oswalt, played by Ethan Hawke. He’s a true crime writer with a desire to write his best book ever, and the desire quickly turns to an obsession, as the last time he achieved fame was a decade ago with his first book. This obsession drives him to not only move to the same town where the grisly deaths of a family occurred, but into their house where they were murdered!

Now it’s obvious that Sinister is a horror movie, but…the first act of the movie could very well be the first act of a crime thriller along the same lines as Red Dragon (a great movie that should be seen if you haven’t already). This provides the audience a good portrayal of the mental and physical toll that the story takes on Ellison, as well as the family dynamics and how his obsessions affect his wife and children.

Although a successfully scary film, there are two issues that were hard for me to ignore. The first is that the actors playing Ellison’s children, Ashley and Trevor, were less than impressive. It’s no surprise for kid actors to not give great performances, but the daughter’s deadpan performance was incredibly distracting. Then again, my disappointment could be from comparing these kids to Pierce Gagnon, the kid from Looper.

The second and most jarring issue is Sinister’s reliance upon loud music and sounds for many of its scares, like Insidious. Or as my friend the Film Phage put it: “LOUD NOISES!” Despite the annoyingly influential LOUD NOISES…*ahem*…despite the annoyingly influential loud noises and music however, these elements are used in a way that lead to an effectively creepy and unnerving movie. Sure it’s a manipulative tool, but a tool that is used really well.


In that same year, the retrospective Fant’Italia, organized by La Cappella Underground, ventured – for the first time in a systematic manner – into the research of the Italian fantastic, among lost celluloids and repertoire films, widely anticipating the more recent secret stories of our cinema, which have caused its rediscovery and revaluation on a global scale.
This is where the 16th edition of the Trieste Science+Fiction Festival starts from. In the DNA of the event there is always the good old Science Fiction Festival, but in the algorithm that animates us in the cockpit there is above all the spirit of research at 360 degrees, to bring on stage the best and the most recent independent sci-fi productions coming from all the corners of planet Earth. This is also the reason why in this 16th edition the cinéphiles will benefit of one extra day of program.
But the Festival broadens its range of action especially in a multidisciplinary direction, if in the age of crossover this term can still be used. More music, with the ultra sounds “made in FVG” of the opening concert of TARM and of those by DJ Yoda during the Invasion of the Body Snatchers Night.
More comics, with the o cial image signed by Davide Toffolo and the exhibition of Nathan Never in the 25th anniversary of the most popular science fiction series in Italy. More video games, with the vintage video game space Play It Again. More animation and stop motion, with two dedicated labs. More attention to the industry dimension and to training, with the first Fantastic Film Forum open to the professionals of the sector. More science, with the Futurology Meetings in collaboration with the most prestigious scientific institutions of our territory and Future Environment screenings. More attention to the younger audience, with a greater number of initiatives dedicated to schools and teenagers. More of Trieste, with Esterno/Giorno walks through the movie scene locations in town. More dramatics, with an exceptional guest star and Urania Life Achievement award who has seen things you people wouldn’t believe…
It is no chance that in our vision between science and fiction there is a plus!
And so, quoting a song particularly in tune with the image of this edition of the Festival: “Come one, come all. The incredible spetaculo de la vida, the incredible spetaculo de la muerte!”. And we’d like to add

14. Wally states his fundamental objection to Andre’s strange adventures: Andre and those he was with attempted to strip purpose away from all activity in an attempt to experience pure being. But, according to Wally, it is our nature to do things with purpose. Andre responds that we can do all sorts of things but still be completely dead inside. Can these two views be reconciled?

REVIEWS

My Dinner with Andre strikes me as a film which many wish to have seen, but few wish to see. Though I understand full well that, like philosophy itself, the film is meant for "selective audiences," and though I love philosophy, I simply could not bring myself to become engaged in the film. It is, to be blunt, about 30 minutes of interesting dialogue packed into a 110-minute film. Most of the film consists of Andre's blabbering forth syrupy pop-spirituality, which is meant to be legitimized somehow by his connection to the theatre community. Though Andre occasionally makes a good point, he consistently does so in the same annoying, patronizing manner, in which he treats Wally – who for most of the film plays the part of the audience – as though he were some poor simpleton who has never had the privilege of Andre's hippie-dippy enlightenment camps. By the third act, Wally finally begins to speak up and offers some criticisms of Andre's views; though I understand the purpose of the mounting tension released at this point, Wally simply did not offer enough bite in his replies to be satisfactory. In particular, I was most bothered by Andre's repeated (usually implied) insistence that his whacky adventures are necessary to get in touch with reality. As the film uses Wally as the audience's on-screen counterpart, I was thoroughly disappointed when he did not slap Andre in the face and inform him that all he has accomplished is getting in touch with whacky adventures, and thus has set himself up for precisely the same sort of alienation which he so thoroughly laments. -- Frezno Smooth

I would not recommend this movie, unless the philosophical issues of finding a persons purpose in life was worth watching a hour and half two guy chatting. The movie made some nice and interesting points. However, the movie was too long, a little boring, and the meaning of the movie was hard to pinpoint. Watching one person chat for 45 minutes in a motion picture is not my impression of entertaining. The philosophical issues of

"That was huge," Mitchell said. "Playing then, I wasn't as known as I am now. Being able to go against guys that were ahead of me, and basically on the same path as me, and competing against them was huge."

Mitchell has been well-known in Charlotte circles since playing in the eighth grade for Covenant Day and winning the Bob Gibbons Tournament of Champions. In that tournament, he played with Team United's Kennedy Meeks (UNC signee) and Sindarius Thornwell (South Carolina signee).

Mitchell grew up in Vancouver, Washington, and Portland, Ore., before settling in the Charlotte area for middle school. He transferred to brand-new Cuthbertson High his ninth grade year and helped them finish second in the NCHSAA 2A playoffs. Cuthbertson fell to Kinston 58-55 in the title game, despite 22 points from Mitchell.

Cuthbertson and Kinston were able to renew their rivalry in the losers bracket at the Holiday Invitational. Mitchell and senior wing Isiah Cureton sparked a second half comeback to pull out a 50-47 win over Kinston back on Dec. 28. Mitchell had 19 points in the big win and looks like he has improved since last March.

"I've gotten a little stronger, though he [Helms] might not believe that," Mitchell said. "I'm more mentally tough. Even when things aren't going my way, I still keep my head in the game. Last year, I think I got down on myself at times. This year, I just keep playing

At first glance it appeared that the English Defence League had re-branded under the leadership of Michael Dawson and Stephen Warnock, but having put that to bed, there is a lot to be intrigued by the move. Now that the hysteria window has closed, I think it’s time to give the lads at Futurebrand a break.

The English domestic game is in rude financial health, and the EFL should take great pride in developing a league with the fourth largest attendance in the world. There is talk in the press release about global identity, stakeholders, focus groups, having meetings with Johnstone’s Paints about it – but the heart of it is the opening quote.

"The new EFL name rightly emphasises the central role our clubs play at the heart of English professional football,” says Shaun Harvey. Quite right too.

We like leaving our houses and watching football in the fresh air with our own eyes. Can we do it at Rochdale on a Tuesday night? Unequivocally yes. Football clubs are at the heart of local communities, supported by local people. There is pride, a shared identity, a warmth from simply being together in the English Football League that is to be cherished. The heart of English professional football is a lovely, and accurate turn of phrase.

Of course though, it’s hard not to discuss the English Football League without bringing the Barclays Premier League into the fold. As a Queens Park Rangers fan, I feel highly qualified to comment on the club’s relationship with both.

Here we have a club with a fanbase essentially stretching in a thin strip from Ladbroke Grove to Heathrow, and a crowd of 18,000. Fans of the club are at their happiest when the team is passing the ball, playing attacking attractive football, the players are smiling and the shirt has a clear, broad blue hoop. That is it. With that approach they won the Championship in 2011, and that strip of West London smiled. A local joyful experience that had nationwide moment in the sun.

Yet the promised-land is the global multinational Barclays Premier League, where clubs are owned by oligarchs, sovereign funds and betting firms that happen to be located in Leicester or Stoke. As those clubs become global commodities, they risk a fraying of ties between fans and communities, something the Premier League are acutely aware of.

On the other side of the ball, rookie linebacker Ja'Whaun Bentley stood out for the second consecutive week. The fifth-round pick has a chance to enter the season as a starter next to Dont'a Hightower.

2. Nick Foles' 2018 preseason debut didn't exactly go as scripted. The reigning Super Bowl MVP was knocked out of the game with a strained shoulder, sustained on a strip sack that went for a Patriots touchdown early in the second quarter. A rusty Foles took three sacks and showed scattershot accuracy in his 18 minutes of action. He's expected to undergo further testing Friday on the shoulder. It will be interesting to see which quarterback is under center for next week's regular-season audition versus the Browns.

3. The Jets not only have the league's most captivating quarterback battle, but also quite the conundrum for Week 1. Sam Darnold entered Thursday night's game with a tailwind of momentum, the future of the franchise riding a wave of optimism after a promising preseason debut. By the start of the fourth quarter, however, it had become harder and harder to ignore the fact that Teddy Bridgewater has outplayed him for two straight weeks. Meanwhile, incumbent starter Josh McCown has played just one series this preseason, leaving his role a mystery. There might not be a more impactful preseason bout than next week's crosstown showdown between the Jets and Giants.

4. Slimmed-down running back Rob Kelley has a new lease on life after entering training camp in a fight for a roster spot. After losing rookie Derrius Guice to an ACL tear last week, the Redskins saw power back Samaje Perine go down with an ankle injury Thursday night. Meanwhile, Kelley has started both preseason games and was the focal point of the first-team offense versus the Jets, touching the ball eight times before exiting.

Don't sleep on undrafted wide receiver Cam Sims, who led the team with 75 receiving yards in the preseason opener. Sims had an up-and-down performance Thursday night, but showed tantalizing playmaking ability at 6-foot-5.

5. Mason Rudolph didn't have to wait long for his welcome to the NFL moment against the Packers. The rookie quarterback threw a pick-six on his first passing attempt of the game -- a pass Packers cornerback Tramon Williams probably saw coming even before it left Rudolph's hand. Rud

Anyway we “think” we have found the way to cause a disintegration of the atom. An

experiment in the New Mexico desert was startling – to put it mildly. Thirteen pounds of the

explosive caused the complete disintegration of a steel tower 60 feet high, created a crater 6

The experiment was not essential to conduct upon the lives of countless civilians who ended up losing their existence to Mr. Truman’s whim. The United States should simply have shown the New Mexico desert example to the Japanese, and warned them thereby. Science allows for such examples to serve as warnings. In any case, Mr. Truman was successful in that he managed to warn the Japanese alright.[3] As a matter of fact, the Americans promised the Japanese more ruin to come from the air, if the latter failed to concede subsequent to the Hiroshima explosion. Was it not reasonable for the U.S. to have waited more than three days before it also bombed Nagasaki – for the effects of the bomb to show up in greater intensity in Hiroshima, or for the Japanese to simply look upon their damages and surrender? The effects of the bomb were present the first day to boot.[4] Unfortunately, the Japanese did not concede until after the Nagasaki bombing.[5]

According to the Americans, by bombing Hiroshima and Nagasaki, they terrified the Japanese into surrender. However, it can reasonably be argued that the United States should have used its actual scientific testing of the nuclear weapon (in the Mexican desert) to scare the Japanese, instead. The U.S. could have easily reported the scientific testing in the Japanese press. Furthermore, the U.S. should not have bombed Nagasaki after Hiroshima, seeing that the effects of the bomb in Hiroshima were horrible at best. The United States is a nation of people standing by God through their world-famous Declaration of Independence and Constitution. It is quite obvious from news reports about the Hiroshima bombing alone that the attack called for the help of God. In actual fact, the attack was a miserable failure for the United States because it stopped all sense of normal life in Hiroshima in the twinkling of an eye. Quite similar to 9/11, the Hiroshima bombing was enough as warning, even if we were to give the U.S. the benefit of the doubt by assuming that the scientific experiment could not have been enough of a warning for the Japanese. The U.S. should

After the standard introduction atop a balcony with Congress as a backdrop, the D.C. Top Chef puts the popular mise en place Quickfire challenge front and center. Had everyone been asked to cook, we’d have gotten the usual mélange of dishes, with some overachievers underachieving and vice versa, and no real sense of who the contenders are this season. Granted, no challenge will tell us everything about how the season is going to shape up, but it stands to reason that those with refined knife skills are very likely to be refined in other areas. And lo, a pair of tough-talking, “alpha-male” types emerge as the persons to beat: Kenny, who zips through three of the four stages in first place (including breaking down four whole chickens at a rate of 10 seconds per), and Angelo, who ultimately wins the Quickfire (and $20,000) with his roasted wing & thigh, curry onion jam, and potato noodles.

Playing the role of hubristic culinary hotshot to the hilt, Angelo also emerges as the early villain of Season Seven, announcing his absurd ambition “to be the first contestant to win every single challenge” and likening his cooking to “an orchestra with flavors.” Still, I prefer brash, overconfident chefs who can cook to the brash, overconfident chefs who don’t know what they’re doing, and there’s the expected abundance of the latter early on. The Elimination challenge asks the chefs to divide into four groups and create individual dishes that most strongly represent where they’re from—all for the 300 or so partygoers (including The Bachelor from The Bachelor!) celebrating cherry blossom season. With the best and worst from each group up for victory and elimination, respectively, the two top Quickfire competitors, Angelo and Kenny, are given the advantage of choosing someone weak to square off against. Tactically, it’s only a minor edge, since nobody knows for sure how good or bad anyone else is yet; on a more personal level, it’s likely to cause friction between the Quickfire champs and the chefs they assume suck the most.

Surprise, surprise, the chefs who make head-slappingly stupid decisions are punished for it later. You had to know Jacqueline was in trouble when she talked about her desire to prove that self-taught cooks who cater can win Top Chef. Then

The workers had been on strike since walking off their jobs last August. Late last month a judge ruled that the company had violated labor law and ordered the workers reinstated with back pay to May 6. The workers returned to their jobs last week, but on the same day, Stella Doro announced it was shutting the factory in three months because the union had failed to make any meaningful concessions that would stop the company from losing money.

The union is also seeking to reopen negotiations over both the expired collective bargaining agreement and Stella Doro officials decision to close the plant and relocate production.

The company cannot simply ignore the decision of a federal administrative law judge and it cannot punish the workers at Stella Doro for exercising their rights under law, said Joyce Alston, president of Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers Local 50.

Calls to Stella Doro, Brynwood and their attorney, Mark Jacoby, were not returned. The company released a statement last week charging union leadership with failing to grasp that any business that cannot operate profitably must seek changes that will enable it to do so.

Elbert Tellem, the assistant regional director of the NLRB, confirmed the unions filings, but would not otherwise comment.

Labor lawyer Michael Weber, a senior partner at Littler Mendelson, said the workers attempt to link the closing to union activity was not surprising. They could argue it, but if the company can show legitimate business reasons for their actions, they have every right to go where they can operate profitably, he said.

The former regional director of the NLRB, Dan Sullivan, said that because Stella Doro indicated that it was not going out of business completely and would continue to produce products after the shutdown, the union may have a case. They have to prove the reason for closing was union activity and not, as the employer says, economic motivation, he said.

He said the union would likely point to the timing of the plant closing announcement, which occurred soon after the judges decision, and that the company would continue to stand by the position that it was losing money.

A spokesman for Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the mayor appointed a mediator in April, but that the two sides were unable to resolve their differences. He said the tax abatements Stella Doro received are available to any business that builds

NU said it expects that 40 of its affected IT employees will be rehired by the outsourcers "and will still work at NU facilities."

In response to their lobbying efforts, several Connecticut legislators in 2003 introduced a series of bills to limit H-1B visa use, arguing that it was being used to transfer jobs overseas. The efforts were unsuccessful and eventually the Connecticut organization that fought visa use disbanded.

Utility jobs had been considered among the more stable in Connecticut, at least until NU merged last year with Boston-based utility NStar.

Company officials at the time told regulators and lawmakers that the merger would lead to savings. Once word leaked out last month that NU was considering offshore outsourcing in its IT department, state lawmakers responded.

"Shipping these good-paying jobs away will not just hurt Connecticut's economy, but it could also pose a serious security threat," said State Rep. Joe Aresimowicz, a Democrat and House majority leader, in a statement last week.

Connecticut's unemployment rate is at 8.1%, the 35th highest in the nation, and the state's labor pool has seen a slight decline in size this year.

In a statement today, NU said: "We spent a great deal of time over the last year studying our combined, post-merger IT department and determined we had two very distinct business models - neither of which was best practice when compared with current IT models. In order to meet customer expectations and deliver the latest IT solutions, we have designed one integrated, forward-looking, technology-savvy organization."

NU said the transition will begin in November and will last through June of 2014. The utility is offering employees a voluntary separation package.

John Miano, a programmer and attorney who founded the Programmers Guild, said that when he started following IT offshoring in mid-1990s, "most of the (news) coverage was over incidents like this (NU's move) and there was shock."

Now, most of the H-1B news coverage is about how bringing in more H-1B workers will create jobs, said Miano.

"The sad thing is these companies don't save any money doing this," said Miano. "The problem is there is no management consulting dollars for telling people the risks and why nots of offshoring."

There certainly seemed to be Wednesday as students from the hosting Piñon Unified School District swept six of the 10 positions at the Chinle Agency Spelling Bee to qualify for the Navajo Nation Spelling Bee on March 13.

Eighth-grade champion Catherine Lopez and runner-up Raquel Tom were from Piñon Middle School and Piñon Accelerated Middle School, respectively; seventh-grade champ Nykesha Nez was from Piñon Middle; and both the fifth- and fourth-grade champions, Chenoa Begaye and Latisha Mike, hailed from Piñon Elementary as did fourth-grade runner up Nigel James.

Only the sixth-grade match, won by Cameron Fuller (home-schooled) with Cina Curley (Canyon de Chelly Elementary) as the runner-up, did not include a top finisher from Piñon.

Chinle Elementary claimed the fifth-grade runner-up, Casey Jones, while the seventh-grade runner-up, Mikail Morgan, was from Chinle Junior High School.

Even Piñon's elementary school sponsor, library technician Presilita Bia, was hard-pressed to explain her team's success.

"It's only my second year as a sponsor, and these kids have only had a week and a half to study," she said, explaining that she was out sick most of December. "I gave some of them a word list, but they lost it."

She did say the kids had good luck with words — a lot of the words used in Wednesday's bee had come up at the school's spelling bee as well.

The bee also featured Chinle Agency's first home-schooled winner, Fuller, who was a force to be reckoned with last year, when she represented Mesa View Elementary and won the lower-grades round of the Navajo Nation bee.

It was fortunate her parents, Greg and Regina Fuller, had pulled her out to home-school her this year, or she wouldn't have been able to compete; Mesa View didn't field a team this year.

Greg Fuller said he and his wife, a nurse at Chinle's IHS hospital, were somewhat at a loss helping their precocious daughter study for the bee.

"We couldn't find anyone who had entered a home-schooled child in the spelling bee," said Greg Fuller, a stay-at

Magic Meatballs are designed to playfully familiarize children with lab-grown meat. Young people are more prone to overconsumption of proteins and fats, and are more sensitive to the hormones and antibiotics used in conventional meat production. Luckily, lab-grown Magic Meatballs can be tailored precisely to a child’s individual needs.

The basic meat consists solely of animal protein, and the combination of fats, omega-3s and vitamins is completely customizable. Colors and flavors can also be added to the neutral base to make the meat change color or crackle in your mouth. Magic Meatballs actively involve kids with the meat they eat, so that future generations will more readily accept protein grown in labs.

As the planet’s population speeds towards 9 billion, it’s becomes impossible to continue consuming meat like we do today. Will we all be eating rice and beans? Grasshoppers perhaps? Scientists hope to keep us eating vertebrate protein with in vitro meat. Grown in bioreactors from animal cells, in vitro meat could be a sustainable and humane alternative to raising a whole animal from birth to slaughter. The first lab-grown hamburger is expected within the next few months.

But why should lab-grown meat look like the meat we consume today? Growing protein in bioreactors could lead to entirely new forms of meat with radically different aesthetics, materials and eating rituals. While these new products might seem unfamiliar and artificial, much of the meat we already consume is divorced from the animal’s natural form: Ground beef, smoked sausages, and chicken nuggets.

A selection of these future in-vitro meat scenarios is currently shown at the highly recommended Food Culture: Eating by Design exhibition at the Design Huis in Eindhoven (NL). As you might not happen to be in the neighborhood, we will also publish them online over the next few weeks. The projects were coached by Menno Stoffelsen, Koert van Mensvoort, Cor van der Weele, Daisy van der Schaft and Ronald van Tienhoven. Illustration by K. Cheng.

Inquiry: I am having trouble finding a job as a bank teller. It may be because I am way overweight. Although I could do the job, I would need some accommodation from the employer...but no one has offered a job. Do I have any legal rights?

-- Sally, Norwalk

Response: Your legal rights will largely depend on whether your obesity condition will be considered to be a "disability" or not. There are state laws and federal laws (ADA) that prohibit disability discrimination.

The letters "ADA" stand for a federal law: Americans with Disabilities Act. This law took effect on July 26, 1992. It applies to employers with at least fifteen employees. Connecticut state law also prohibits disability discrimination by employers with at least three employees. Its law is similar to the ADA.

Prohibited

As with the other employment discrimination statutes which prohibit age, race, sex, religious and national origin discrimination, the ADA and the state disability laws outlaw discrimination against the handicapped in all employment practices ---- including recruiting, hiring, placement, training, promotion, transfer, benefits and discharge (among others).

Who Is Protected?

The ADA protects applicants or employees who are "qualified individuals with disabilities." Note the word "qualified" ---- just having a disability doesn't mean you are protected by the law. One has a disability under the ADA if he/she is:

1. a person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, or

2. a person who has a record of such impairment, or

3. a person who is regarded as having such an impairment.

Individuals with substantial, chronic (on-going) impairments that limit major life activities such as speaking, walking, talking, hearing, seeing, breathing, etc. are individuals with a disability. Various medical conditions such as the following would usually be considered to be a disability: diabetes, epilepsy, AIDS, paralysis, mental retardation, M.S., substantial loss of hearing or vision, etc.

Even individuals who are currently healthy but who have a history of a disabling condition would be considered to be covered by the ADA. An example would be an employee who is currently in remission after having had cancer.

Those employees who are regarded as having a disability by their employer -- but aren't actually disabled -- are also considered to be

New Firefox Runs Like a Rabbit

New version releases of browsers aren’t getting the buzz that they had to buy, however, Firefox Quantum can be an exclusion.

The most recent variant of the Mozilla Foundation’s browser, released Tuesday, is all about performance. Firefox is twice as fast since it was a year past, Mozilla maintained.

Google Translate has since improved significantly, however we’re not quite convinced that Pixel Buds, the real-time translator, will work any better despite media claims. In one sales pitch on behalf of the Cupertino-based tech giant, online magazine Engadget had this to say about Google Pixel Buds – despite only witnessing a 5-minute display on a San Francisco stage:

“You’ll be able to walk up to nearly anybody in another country and hold a fluid, natural language conversation without the need for pantomime and large hand gestures, or worry of offending with a mispronunciation. International commerce and communication could become as mundane as making a local phone call. The frictions of international diplomacy could be smoothed as well, ensuring that not only are a diplomat’s words faithfully translated but that a copy of the conversation is recorded well.”

Nevertheless, google translate does not translate language in a “fluid” and “natural” way. It makes a sentence understandable – which is about as much as machine translations have advanced in the past two years. Granted, translation apps have come a long way since Altavista launched Babel Fish in 1997, but they also have a long way to go before they are fluid and natural.

How does Google Translate work?

Like most technology Google produces these days, their new translations device principally works on foundations built by artificial intelligence. Google bots have a vast network of data they can tap into where their machines match words which appear to be parallel between two different languages.

The artificial intelligence then crunches this data to determine the most probable word in which language A corresponds to language B. Google Translate therefore is statistical guesswork based on conversations between foreign counterparts.

Although Google has ambitions to “pursue human quality translation and develop machine translation systems” statistical machine translation will never be 100% accurate. However, it is estimated that the accuracy of translations is set between 80-90%.

As a result, we cannot argue that Google Translate is a useful holiday companion. But if you need accurate translations for professional or business purposes such as legal, medical or marketing, the only solution is to work with an expert translation agency specialising in providing business translation services. Such companies will guarantee accuracy and reliability and ensure that your content is precisely localised for the target market or customer.

Translation companies such as TS24 will be able to not only carefully and accurately translate your content, but will also be able

Notes on The Intersection: Tales of the Taj

It took Shah Jahan 17 years to build the iconic Taj Mahal, a mausoleum for his wife Mumtaz, who died during childbirth in 1631. A structure known as the testament of true love for centuries has also been the cause of both pride and controversy in equal measure for India. If you walk around it, you will see that its four facades are identical, with vaulted arches and quotes from the Holy Quran inlaid onto the marble.

This is because the Mughals considered symmetry symbolic of balance and harmony in their empire. But, as Dr. Dilip Ahuja proves through his research and tells us in the podcast, it’s not as perfect as it seems. So, was the iconic monument created with a single error on purpose? Or, did the artists and craftsmen make an honest mistake because of a lack of advanced scientific equipment? Did Shah Jahan know? The answers to these questions are hidden in the legends that surround the history of the building – some that tell of Shah Jahan cutting off the hands and gouging out the eyes of artists who built it and others of how he wanted to build a black version of the Taj Mahal for himself.

A total of Rs 32 million (today’s equivalent of Rs 53 billion) was spent on constructing the Taj; it was made with makrana marble from Rajasthan, lapis lazuli from Central Asia and turquoise from Tibet, and it is said that 1,000 elephants were required to transfer these materials all the way from their homes to Agra. But, this luxury also put the Taj at risk once the Mughal Empire collapsed in the 18th century. The Jats (a Hindu community from North India), looted it in 1964 and stripped it of its two silver doors. British colonisers plundered it for the hand-woven carpets and precious gems, but Lord Curzon the viceroy of India from 1899 to 1905, ordered the restoration of the historical site and its gardens. He also gifted the Taj with a grand chandelier, which unfortunately, came crashing down in August 2015 and is currently being restored.

Today, Agra has transformed from being a Mughal Capital to an economically advanced city, the industrialisation and resulting pollution leading to the yellowing of the Taj’s pristine white marble. The monument has since gotten a beauty treatment of sorts – workers applied Fuller’

LOVELAND, Colo. - A crew of 33 people and eight dogs searched a 21-mile area along Big Thompson River in Loveland on Wednesday.

In addition to the searchers from the Poudre and Loveland Fire Authorities, the team includes people and dogs from federal search teams based in Boone County, Missouri and Clark County, Nevada. They're looking for people who could be trapped or killed in the massive debris flow.

"We're doing good, the crews are holding their own. They're working longs hours," said Jason Starck, a battalion chief with the Loveland Fire Rescue Authority. "They're spirits are up and we're just trying to get one task off the list at a time."

"The dogs are trained to alert for live human scent," said Dr. Erin Venable, a K-9 handler with the team from Boone County, Missouri. "What we're doing basically is clearing any spot where a human could possibly be and we’re also making sure we haven’t missed someone who might have been stuck in the debris field."

The dogs are Labrador retrievers and German Shepherd breeds who were trained and certified in a process that takes up to two years. The training includes behavior, agility and search practice.

"By the time these dogs make it to this level, they are literally the best of the best," Venable said.

The large scale of the search provides unique challenges for the dogs, she explained.

"We need to keep dogs happy, need to keep dogs motivated," she said, "So we’ll stop every now and then and just offer dogs motivation."

The muddy, potentially hazardous debris makes it difficult for the se

By morning…we were in Zarrah's vet. I asked him, "what should I do?" He said, "My job is to be the voice of your dog". After listening to her full story….he said, "Please, give her peace". It would be irresponsible to give her to a shelter after knowing her traumatic situations and reoccurring disposition. If you should keep her, I can tell you how difficult it is because I too, have had two dog attacks with our own pets. They didn't have trauma, it is usually because of two things. Toy or Food.

Advice from our vet: If you have a dog(s). CRATE or USE SEPERATE ROOMS if they're eating or chewing on bones. If they have done it a millions times before…consider yourselves LUCKY. It only takes a heavy scent or behavioral issue to make any "normal situation into an isolated, harmful event". His dogs are crated when no one is home and always during the feeding/bone times. He even said, "knowing what he knows about his situation, he would have euthanized his dog too". It is too difficult to live in fear of safety for you and your animals.

Safety is our gateway to the choice we made. Although it was the most difficult choice ever, it was the right one. Please let Zarrah's story resinate with yours and make you think differently when it comes to toy vs. food.

Our hearts will take a great amount of time to heal. Zarrah passed away in my arms, her head started to raise when she was heading to heaven. I was singing Silent Night to her and told her to go chase all the angels and rabbits. Her heart stopped and it felt like mine did too. The moment I got into the car, her scent was so strong. She jumped right into the car and came home. Her presence is ever present. Daisy let's us know she is here.

Zarrah entered the kingdom. I shall never fear when I get there because I know she will be the first that I see, waiting for us.

May 1st, 2015. She shared the date of a famous singer that passed away the same day "Stand by Me". It also was the day that Justice system played it's first hand to getting justice for Freddie Gray. State of Maryland vs. MD Police Department. Both of these two events are a beautiful beginning and ending.

Growing up I ate the peppery root once a year, when a scoop of white or beet-stained prepared horseradish played a starring role as the "bitter herb" at my family's Passover seder.

Today, the pungent, nose-tickling condiment immediately conjures up thoughts of springtime, my parents' dining room table, and how my brother and I would compete to see who could eat the most horseradish without crying.

Recently though, while having brunch with friends, I discovered horseradish being used in an entirely unfamiliar context: as a mix-in to scrambled eggs. Was it a life changing meal? Not particularly. But it was delicious, and the experience got me thinking that maybe horseradish deserved year-round attention.

With other fiery condiments like wasabi increasingly gaining favor in American kitchens, now seems like a perfect time for a horseradish renaissance.

Native to Eastern Europe, horseradish is relative to mustard greens, broccoli rabe and, yes, radishes. It is a particularly ugly thing — not much more than a dry and gnarled brown root — and for centuries it was used only in medicinal contexts before catching on as a culinary ingredient.

My Lithuanian ancestors likely ate it as a topping on fish, cold meat, and kugel. And by the late 1600s, horseradish had traveled to central and western Europe, where Englanders favored it as a pairing for beef and oysters.

They knew then what I'm learning now: despite its fierce bite, horseradish is a surprisingly versatile ingredient. Particularly when left raw (heat mellows the spiciness), it makes a natural companion to red meat and creamy root vegetable soups, where its heat cuts through the dishes' richness.

It also perks up lighter fare from springtime salad dressings to pickled beets and eggs, adds a little kick to certain sweet dishes like applesauce, and is a classic mix-in to drinks like the bloody Mary.

Too often, Americans believe they’re waging a war on terror, forgetting that war itself is terror. That war itself is evil. That doesn’t mean that war is never justified, as it was, I believe, in the struggle against Nazi tyranny in World War II. Even in justifiable wars, however, we need to recognize that war breeds corruption; that war, in essence, is corruption, a corruption of the human spirit, of a humanity which should be held in common and nourished, but which during war is degraded if not destroyed.

John Dower recognizes this. It’s a theme he explores in his new book, The Violent American Century: War and Terror Since World War Two. Consider it a primer on war’s many corruptions, and a precis of America’s tendency toward a nationalism of callous indifference when it comes to the damages we inflict on others. It’s not happy reading, but then again wars shouldn’t be a subject for happiness.

A remarkable primer and meditation on America’s endless wars

Wars and rumors of war seem always to be with us. Some would say they’re an inevitable part of the human condition. Our historical record seems to support that grim conclusion. Yet there is another way, a more pacific path, a path toward peace. But to walk that path, we must first fully recognize the tangled undergrowth of war that imperils our every footstep. Dower’s latest book helps us to do just that.

11 thoughts on “Memories of War”

Although I agree with most everything written above, something you posited before, about “..people not having a reason to care…,” leaves me continually dispirited. That is to say, that meaningful, intraspective writing, does little more than ‘sing to the choir,’ as it were. How can we break through the strengthening forces of hyper partisanship? If citizens are unwilling to care about the ongoing wars, what will words do? I ask only rhetorically. By no means do I condone giving up.

If only we could somehow get people to care as much about their country as they do their favorite sports team or television programs? And if people did pay attention? Would we have less war, or more? Once upon a time I believed the answer was clear. Today, not so much.

Yes. I’d say first that the choir needs to

Tips for reducing waste at home

In the Kitchen

Get a compost pail or bucket at your local hardware store for your food and paper scraps. Take it out to your compost cart every day to reduce odors.

Use durable plates and utensils for all your dining needs. Even outdoor eating is easy with washable, reusable plastic ware. If you are expecting a large party, you can use certified compostable plates, utensils, and cups. (Make sure the products say “certified compostable” before putting them in your curbside compost bin.)

In the Bathroom

Stick a small compost bin in each bathroom to collect paper towels and tissues.

Recycle your shampoo bottles.

In the Office

Use a small recycle bin to collect office paper, newspapers, mail and magazines.

While Shopping

Buy products that are minimally packaged. Examples include cereal in plastic bags only instead of boxes, and items that have only one packaging like a box and no outer plastic packaging.

Buy products that have packaging that can be reused or recycled. Cardboard can be recycled at the curb, and white block foam packaging and bubble wrap can be recycled at the Center for Hard to Recycle Materials (CHaRM) in Boulder. Fees may apply. Learn more at www.ecocycle.org/charm.

Buy in bulk when you can. Grocery stores have bulk dispensers that allow you to purchase the quantity of nuts, grains, beans or rice you need without a lot of extra packaging.

When cleaning out the garage or basement

Take items like old electronics, white block foam packaging, appliances, yoga mats and much more can be recycled (fees may apply) at the Center for Hard to Recycle Materials (CHaRM) in Boulder. Learn more at www.ecocycle.org/charm.

Tips for reducing odors and pests in your compost

To reduce odors in your kitchen, take food scraps out to your compost cart every day.

Put your food scraps in either a certified compostable bag (available at grocery stores) or paper bag before placing it in your compost cart

Cover food waste with newspapers or yard clippings to deter flies

Sprinkle baking soda in the bottom of your cart to reduce odors

The new Sir Peter Wright production for the Royal Ballet has Clara and the Nutcracker played by adults. This was deliberate so that the two lead dancing roles could be enhanced. The production was very well recieved and even I, not a great Nutcracker fan, had lots of fun.<P>I saw Alina Cojacoro and Ivan Petrov, both in their late teens or thereabouts and they were superb. WE don't expect to see a child playing Juliet, so i really don't see why we can't have an adult play Clara, albeit that she stays in the childlike personna unlike Juliet.<P>I can understand that others may prefer to see children in these roles and that's fine as well. I wouldn't try to prescribe for people which version they should prefer.

I wouldn't prescribe, either, and I think both approaches are valid. It depends on the concept of the production.<P>JaneGrey, I agree with you that, at times, adults playing children can backfire. I remember in Baryshnikov's Nutcracker, feeling uncomfortable with some of the antics of Fritz and Friends. But some of the women did well with the kids' parts. And I thought both Gelsey (even in the video) and Marianna were wonderful. In this production, Clara is a child on the brink of young womanhood, and I didn't sense a false impulse from either of these ballerinas. It worked completely for me.<P>Re: old Divas, the first thing that came to mind for me was Fonteyn and Nureyev in R&J. She was much older than he. But during that performance, they were both teen-agers. No question about it.<P>Azlan, it was a thrill for me to do that brief stint with Boston. I don't think I was paid. If I was, it wasn't much, I'm sure. There might have been some type of honorarium, but it was a long time ago, and I honestly don't remember. I do remember walking into the Land of the Sweets on the arm of the Prince, being greeted by the Sugar Plum Fairy, and genuinely feeling awe. I didn't have to act it. The dancers were very kind, and the company director Sam Kurkijian (or something like that?) was extremely complimentary. I glowed for weeks. That was better than money.

Ironically, given the unwitting status of Yorkshire's man of the moment, Azeem Rafiq, there was general agreement on the introduction of more overseas players into Twenty20 cricket and ensuring that when the competition is expanded, the counties themselves receive a fair chunk of the proceeds. That would appear an axiomatic ambition, except that the expectations in terms of salaries of cricketers from overseas have risen dramatically with the advent of the IPL and the sums of monies involved.

"IPL has changed the landscape," Mark Newton, the chief executive of Worcestershire, said, "and it has become extremely difficult to bring in players because of that. We can't do this unless the income of county clubs improves and television coverage will play a major part from 2010. There is more and more airtime during June and July when there is no football on. I have never been to a meeting of chief executives at which there has been such consensus."

Agreement in particular was reached over expanding the Twenty20 group matches programme from its present two-and-a-half weeks to five weeks' duration. If this means lopping two championship fixtures off the 16 that each county plays, then so be it, although there is no imminent plan to do so. Five home matches in the space of eight days, which was the lot of Warwickshire, were considered too many, not least at a time of so-called credit crunch. Fridays and Sundays proved to be the most popular days for spectators, for obvious reasons, and there was a natural concern that, although gate receipts were higher this year for five home matches than for four in 2007, the formula should not be over-egged.

It is conceivable that fixtures against the university centres of excellence in the early part of the season will be squeezed, so as to bring other competitions forward. The ECB is already sufficiently concerned about the coverage of championship cricket in national newspapers to be contemplating writing to sports editors. This has fallen away considerably in recent years, particularly this season, although that, of course, has in part resulted from the best, centrally contracted, players not taking part, as well as an increasing trend by papers to indulge in watching briefs on the likes of Andrew Flintoff and Kevin Pietersen. There is an increasing desire for news and exclusive stories. The football agenda has caught up with cricket. University matches are hardly reported at all, even though centres of excellence, financially supported by MCC, are thriving.

Even in the

There has been some work on XRX frameworks, and clearly it would be
beneficial for anybody (users, but also implementors,) to have such a
standard packaging format for entire applications following their
rules (as WAR and EAR files can be to Java.) And they would benefit
also from a more low-level packaging format dedicated to package X*
libraries, and would build upon them. But they really are at
different levels, and I think it is fundamental to make the
distinction between both concepts.

As part of the EXPath project, and because I think this is the first
step X* technologies need for several years to enable the delivery of
libraries, I am particularly interested in a library packaging
format.

To illustrate that, I've built a very simple prototype of a package
manager for Saxon. On the one hand you have a simple GUI to install
and delete packages in a repository, and on the other hand you have a
shell script to launch Saxon (setting the classpath for extension
functions and setting catalogs to resolve XSLT imports refering to
libraries.) If those tools are built around a well-defined, open
package format, other implementations could be written (for eXist, for
MarkLogic, XQilla, Zorba... but also for oXygen, providing a one-click
implementation to install a package and then being able to enable it
in some scenarii.)

You can find the manager at http://www.fgeorges.org/purl/20090624/.
You should be able to run it simply by clicking on one of the links on
the launch.html page (through Java Web Start,) but you can also
download the JAR file (look also in the lib/ sub-directory,) putting
both JAR files in the classpath and running Java the usual way, with
the main class org.expath.pkg.saxon.PackageManagerGUI (there is also a
text interface with org.expath.pkg.saxon.PackageManagerTextUI.) You
first have to set up an environment variable EXPATH_REPO, pointing to
a directory (that will be your EXPath Packaging repository, just
create an empty directory.) The interface is very simple: choose the
install item in the file menu, and select the package file you want to
install

One thing that hasn’t changed is the power of Rock ‘n Roll. One of the biggest names in this future’s music industry is Mok (Don Francks), an aging rock star known for his bizarre and theatrical performances. Well-known though he is, however, his career seems to have peaked some time ago, and he’s had trouble regaining momentum. Hmm. Looks like he might have some spare time on his hands. Maybe he should take up a hobby.

Well, how about summoning a demon? Yeah, that’d do. Mok has become obsessed with the notion of bringing forth a creature from the underworld to do his bidding – just what he wants it for is a little unclear, but he’s bound and determined to do it, nonetheless. (None of these are spoilers, by the way, as this is also all described in the opening crawl.)

The trouble is, he can’t do it alone. He requires a specific vocal tone, a unique voice that will complete the ritual and allow him to carry out his dark plans. He’ll know it when he finds it, but he’s been looking all over the place for such a voice, and so far he’s had no luck.

This all changes when he returns to his hometown of Ohmtown and encounters a small-time rock band made up of Omar (Paul Le Mat), Angel (Susan Roman), Dizzy (Dan Hennessey) and Stretch (Greg Duffel). Omar and Angel are the lead singers, and a couple. It’s somewhat of a bumpy relationship – he’s a bit too focused on his career, and not enough on hers – but they do seem to get along well otherwise.

In any case, Angel winds up taking the lead on the night that Mok comes calling. Wouldn’t you know it, she’s the one that he’s been looking for – she’s got the voice! He’s just got to have her, and quickly sets out trying to seduce her into his employ.

Angel, however, isn’t having any of it. Her career with the band may not have gone as smoothly as it might so far, but they’re her friends, and she’s not going to desert them just as they’re starting to have some success. Mok isn’t taking no for an answer, though – if he can’t

2. Put Some Money in Savings

In addition to socking away money in your retirement account, put some of your paycheck into a savings account.

"As soon as you get your paycheck, set some money aside in your savings account," said Kyle Taylor, founder of ThePennyHoarder.com. "I recommend at least 10 percent. I'd even take it a step further and automate the savings process." For example, you can use an app like Digit to set up an automatic transfer from your checking account to your savings account.

Award-winning personal finance journalist Jean Chatzky is also an advocate for scheduling deposits from your paycheck to your savings account. "Automating savings is the first thing everyone should do with their paychecks," she said. "If you don't see the money, you can't spend it, and it's the best way to guarantee a secure financial future."

The best savings accounts offer liquid money that can come in handy in an emergency — or enable you to save for a big-ticket item you want. They also offer interest-growing potential. Look for an account that comes with a higher APY. With a higher APY, you can earn more interest on your savings.

Although different from a retirement account, this savings account can help you achieve your future goals. "It may sound odd coming from a banker, but there's more to life than just money," said James Capolongo, head of consumer deposit products at TD Bank. "I'm a firm believer in paying yourself first and setting aside a portion of your paycheck to invest in your future."

3. Pay Down Debt

"The first thing people should do is pay down their debt," said entrepreneur John Rampton. "Pay it all off, if possible. If not, pay the highest interest rate items first, like credit card balances."

Paying off the debt with the highest interest first can help you save money in the long term. But you should also make it a priority to pay off any debts that are past due.

"If you have large amounts of outstanding debt and the bill collectors are calling, it only makes sense to pay those debts off in a hurry — either through debt consolidation or by paying off more costly debt first, like high-interest credit cards," said Keisha Blair, co-founder of Aspire-Canada.com, an online platform that offers resources to entrepreneurs and professionals.


Due to a recent endeavor that my wife is entering into I have been researching business software. Almost all of them are overkill unless you can find an IT guy who has programmed a specialized software for his own beekeeping business. QB is well accepted in the accounting world but so are some others. The advantage I see about QB is there are so many people using it so it is easier to get help because as you would expect "free support" is a term used loosely these days.
I am looking towards online software's to alleviate the problem of hardware crashes and maintenance. It will also give me off site access which is necessary. Unfortunately I had to go to Quickbooks online "plus" instead of "essentials" to get class tracking which is really overkill for the business my wife is in. But if you need it you need it.

The biggest nut to crack is dealing with our state government and payroll for any business. That alone kills most businesses from moving out of the hobby classification. For my personal business with no employees I use a spreadsheet and at the end of the year I do a data sort for the ins and the outs and that makes my accountant happy. I would think most bee businesses with no employees could do the same. Once you have employees you have big brother breathing down your neck and then it becomes a whole new ballgame.

Re: Beekeeping Business Accounting

I use QB for my business, its great....but a little bit of a pain.
Set it up as simple as you can to start with. When you launch the program do it with someone that has experience setting up accounts, that is going to do your accounting/taxes or is at the least familiar with QB. Some things are difficult to go back and restructure if you haven't used it.

I'm on an envelope system for my other endeavors. I place a predetermined wad of cash in a envelope and keep track of every time I add and subtract cash on the outside of envelope.
If my envelope is fat I can consider my possibilities if it is getting thin, I know what to do.
It's very motivating and works well for me.

I used to use Quicken, and liked the fact that my bank statements updated themselves every time I logged in. I never had to balance my checkbook manually, and it automatically categorized most expenses. I switched computers and didn't

Investors given opportunity to invest in iconic commercial asset on Sydney’s North Shore

Sydney, 20 May 2016

Centuria Property Funds Limited (Centuria) today announced that contracts have been exchanged on the Zenith, an institutional grade office asset located at 821 Pacific Highway, Chatswood. A new Centuria unlisted property fund, the Centuria Zenith Fund, will co-invest with global investment firm, BlackRock to acquire the property. The purchase price is $279.1 million. The purchase remains subject to FIRB approval, with settlement expected to occur in late July.

Commenting on the Fund, CEO – Unlisted Property Funds, Jason Huljich, said he was confident the Fund would provide attractive returns to investors due to the strong fundamentals of the location and the property itself.

“Sydney’s North Shore office market is already performing strongly, and we expect that it will continue to experience falling vacancies and strong rental growth over the next few years. The withdrawal of commercial office space in the CBD and North Shore due to residential conversion and the construction of the Metro will drive above trend rental growth and mean excellent total returns for our investor clients.

“Chatswood is a dynamic office, retail and residential area and is the North Shore’s major rail and bus hub. The new Sydney Metro rail infrastructure will further improve connectivity,” he said.

The Zenith is a landmark office asset with a diversified tenant mix. Approximately 40% of its rental income is underpinned by government tenants, and it is currently 94% occupied. It has around 44,000sqm of net lettable area with 800 car spaces and occupies a large 8,000 sqm site.

Mr Huljich said that he was pleased to be able to offer such an iconic asset to the market via an unlisted fund.

“In the current low interest rate environment, there’s no question that investors are becoming increasingly yield-driven. Distribution yields from the Zenith Fund are forecast to be 7.6% in the 2017 financial year, growing to 7.7% in the 2018 financial year. These are very attractive rates for such a high quality asset,” Mr Huljich said.

In conclusion, Mr Huljich said that the choice of The Zenith is in line with Centuria’s investment strategy, which has been primarily focused on Sydney over the past 5 years.

“We are

Can cN0 and pCR limit axillary surgery in some breast cancer patients?

CHICAGO – Patients with clinically node-negative HER2-positive or triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who achieve a pathological complete response in the breast after neoadjuvant chemotherapy could benefit from clinical trials to evaluate the option of omitting axillary node surgery in this population, according to a retrospective analysis of more than 22,000 cases in the National Cancer Database reported at the Society of Surgical Oncology Annual Cancer Symposium.

Dr. Judy C. Boughey

“With advances in systemic treatment options and targeted therapy, we are seeing high pathological response rates in patients with breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, especially in patients with HER2+ disease and patients with TNBC,” senior author Judy C. Boughey, MD, professor of surgery at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn, said in an interview. “This is prompting the question of whether surgery on the breast and on the lymph nodes is always required and whether we can identify patients who have had an excellent response and could potentially avoid surgery.”

The analysis involved 22,695 patients who had clinical T1 and T2 disease and had NAC followed by surgery from 2010 to 2014. The goal, she said, was to evaluate rates of nodal positivity (ypN+) in patients with and without a pathological complete response (pCR) following NAC by tumor subtype across both academic and community settings.

“Response rates to NAC have increased,” Dr. Barron said. She cited previous reports that showed response rates ranging from 9%-13% for anthracyclines to 19%-26% with the addition of taxanes, and to 60%-70% with the addition of trastuzumab and pertuzumab in HER2+ disease. “Furthermore, we know that tumor biology affects response rates, with TNBC and HER2+ disease having the highest rates of pathologic complete response,” she said.

“In the current era when we frequently operate on patients, we find no residual cancer in the tissue at the time of surgery,” Dr. Barron said. “The question arises as to whether we can limit surgery in patients with a pathological complete response.” While imaging has limited ability to reliably detect pCR with 100% specificity, she noted that recent trials have shown the potential of tumor-bed biopsy to identify pCR in patients after NAC (Ann Surg.

Anatomy of a thunderstorm

Thunderstorms begin when a parcel of warm, moist air begins to rise. As the air expands and cools, the water vapour within it condenses and forms a cloud (When air masses collide). If there is sufficient atmospheric instability, the heat released by condensation will keep the air inside the cloud warmer than the air surrounding it, enabling it to grow larger and higher. The power of the rising air, or updraft, keeps millions of water droplets in suspension until they become so heavy they fall as rain.
Above the freezing line (typically 12,000 to 15,000 m above the ground in summer), the droplets form supercooled ice crystals that can grow into hailstones. When the thundercloud reaches the cumulonimbus stage and hits the tropopause (where temperature stops decreasing with height, around 12,000 m in summer), the jet stream tugs the cloud into its famous “anvil” shape, and the rising air in the cloud falls back to earth in cool, dry currents of air surrounding the warm, moist core of the storm. These downdrafts can pool at the bottom of the thunderstorm and create microbursts — brief, violent gusts of wind and rain. When the static buildup between the clashing air masses in a thunderstorm (the downdrafts carry a positive charge; the updrafts a negative one) triggers an electrical discharge, lightning forks through the sky at 145,000 km/s. The lightning heats the surrounding air, which expands at supersonic speeds, creating the mighty crashes we recognize as thunder.

Top Gear is to be investigated by media watchdog Ofcom over Jeremy Clarkson's use of the word 'pikey', despite the BBC Trust having previously cleared the show

The word, which is used as a derogatory term for gipsies or travellers, had been scrawled on a sign reading 'Pikey's Peak', and used in a joke at Richard Hammond's expense

Viewers said the censoring of the February performance, shown on a 20 second delay with the offensive words and phrases muted, left it sounding 'like Morse code', with some questioning why it ever went ahead if so much of the song had to be censored.

However, despite the muting, some viewers said they could still hear the N-word on at least three occasions, while another rapper sharing the stage with West was heard to say 's***'.

As well as complaints from the audience at home, fellow musician Lionel Richie, who attended the show, was left unimpressed, and criticised West for his use of the N-Word.

However, Ofcom said it will not be investigating the viewers' complaints.

'We received a number of complaints that Kanye West’s language, shortly after the watershed, was offensive but we will not be taking the matter forward for investigation,' said an Ofcom spokesman.

'Having carefully assessed these complaints, we noted that before the programme ITV took steps to ensure that offensive language was not used, and during the programme to mute the majority of it'.

But the watchdog is investigating the use of 'pikey' in Top Gear, where it was scrawled on a sign reading 'Pikey's Peak', and used in a joke at Richard Hammond's expense.

Ofcom said today it will take no action over an expletive-laden Kanye West performance at this year's Brit awards (pictured)

The BBC Trust backed the show, saying there had been 'no intended racist reference', but Ofcom announced today it would be investigating the episode, which was broadcast in February last year.

The complaint to Ofcom was lodged by the Traveller Movement charity, which had initially complained to the BBC Trust - and said it was 'horrified' by the resulting decision.

How to Get a Radio Brand-Building Website.TALKERS columnist and noted digital radio consultant Chris Miller serves up a new article offering powerful tips on how radio web designers can create sites that contribute toward building their station’s or program’s brand without distracting from it or diluting it. He covers the process on four basic but vital fronts: layout, content, graphics and interaction. Miller asks, “What’s the difference between your site and Google, YouTube and Facebook?” He states, “Those sites have a clear reason for being, and clean, well-organized content.” He strongly suggests, “Get your page looking more Facebookish, or YouTubeEsque, and you’ll go a long way toward building your website numbers.” Miller offers some nuts-and-bolts actions to get more people back more often and clicking on more content.

Lotus Communications Donates $50,000 to Los Angeles Boys and Girls Club. The cash donated to the Los Angeles Boys and Girls Club was not a fundraiser of contributions from listeners but a gift from Spanish sports talk KWKW, Los Angeles owner Lotus Communications. The station recently launched a major partnership with the Los Angeles Boys & Girls Club. After KWKW’s community service personnel learned that the Club was in desperate need of funds in order to provide after school programs, station management decided to step in with a $50,000 check. The money wasn’t raised by listeners. Station president James Kalmenson decided to make a difference

Another factor in how banks determine the interest rates for savings products is supply and demand. The money that customers deposit into their bank accounts is the same money that the financial institution lends out to borrowers, who pay interest on the loans. So, if the demand for loans increases, and the bank needs more deposits from which to lend, they may be inclined to increase the interest rates on their deposit accounts to make them more attractive to savers like you. On the flip side, a decreased demand for loans could result in lower interest rates on savings accounts, because the bank doesn’t need as many deposits to keep up with lending demands.

It’s also typical for banks to base their deposit account rates on “benchmark” interest rates. The federal funds rate is the rate that financial institutions charge each other for extremely short-term loans. This federal funds rate is a common benchmark for the interest rates that banks offer their customers. In other words, if the federal funds rate changes, banks will typically adjust the rates they’re offering customers on savings products like savings accounts and CDs.

Investor demand for U.S. Treasury bonds and notes is another factor, as is the Federal Reserve, which sets the federal funds rate. The Federal Reserve (often referred to simply as “the Fed”) frequently makes announcements and decisions about how monetary policy will impact rates.

The Fed influences these rates by buying or selling previously issued U.S. securities. When it buys more securities, banks end up with more money than they can use for lending, and the interest rates decrease. And when the Fed sells securities, money from the banks is tapped, resulting in fewer funds available for lending. This, in turn, forces a hike in interest rates.

Knowing which factors affect the interest rates on deposit accounts can help you to make a more informed decision when you’re shopping around for a savings product. And don’t forget to review and factor in any fees or maintenance charges associated with the account before you open it – those can take a real bite out of your earned interest if you’re not careful!

So you’re looking to stash some money away for a rainy day…or maybe a sunny vacation stay. But you’re not sure which is a better choice – a savings account or a certificate of deposit (CD).

Obviously both are designed with savings in mind. And both will earn you interest. But there are some significant differences to consider.

Years ago I found this Lady’s Slipper on the ridge above my cabin. I brought her with a huge ball of dirt down the hill and placed her just outside my kitchen window. Each April I wait for her, an announcemnt of another year when I am blessed with spring and hope. The Lady’s Slipper will transplant only into familiar soil. When I first came into these mountains, I felt immediately at home. My roots had never gone deep anywhere I was transplanted though there were many beautiful landscapes that I inhabited and loved. I have felt complete here on this little mountain and able to thrive and bloom in the unlikely geography of these ancient spaces. Its seasons are icons, its beauty is eucharist, its every growing inhabitant and every dying one a metaphor and a prayer.

I have begun to deeply understand Beauty as the single spiritual force that draws me through life and propels me, gives me courage, inspires me. I somehow think it should be Love or Truth..making rules as usual. But it is the Beauty in people, places and things that causes Love to arise in me and saturate me. Beauty activates Truth that then compels me to reject the shallow, the illusory and the sentimental. They are not separate forces but aspects of the One. Finally though, it is the longing for and search for Beauty that flows through my being. It is my life force. It is the gift that is given to me in this particular human incarnation. It is Beauty that invites me into the mystery of experience.

I will put on my painting clothes in a few hours and go down the hill to slather oil paint on panels and push it around, scrape through it and see what happens.

I have worked as a serious craft artist for the past twenty years, painting papers and textiles to use in the creation of one of a kind handmade journals. I have loved color and paint as long as I can remember. One incident with my parents when I was in grade school so threatened my need for praise that I refused ever again to paint “pictures”. Two sisters who achieved success as painters further influenced my decisions to write poems, work with people and finally come in by the back door in my other great loves cloth and bookarts thinking I could satisfy my need for the process of painting in other ways. The longing to paint was intentionally pushed under the surface of a busy life.

One morning in March of 2015, I woke with a se

2. Hot Dog

One hot dog for a 20 pound puppy is the caloric equivalent of three hamburgers for a person. That single hot dog may not look like much but it has around 175 calories, which is a third of what a 20 pound dog should be consuming. “I think people get gratification out of their pet eating and being happy about it, but they don’t think about the long-term consequences,” says Dr. James Darden, DVM, chief of staff at Banfield Pet Hospital in East Houston, Texas.

3. Cheese

One ounce of cheese for a 20 pound dog is the caloric equivalent of 1 ½ chocolate bars for a person. Cheese is loaded with fat — a single 1 oz. slice of American cheese packs 105 calories and 5.5 grams of saturated fat, while Cheddar is even worse: 114 calories and 6 grams of fat. That ounce of cheese constitutes about a third of a small dog’s daily required calories, says Dr. Darden. “And for a cat it’s worse — it’s about half his daily caloric intake, so two slices of cheese for a cat is all it needs in a day.”

4. Potato Chip

One potato chip for a 10 pound cat is the caloric equivalent of half a hamburger for a person. You may think that a thin potato chip is lighter than air, but don’t forget that it’s been fried in saturated fat and coated in sodium. For your small cat, you’re almost providing lunch with a potato chip. A superior option, says Dr. Darden, is a small handful of kibble. He suggests you subtract whatever you feed your cat as a snack from her evening meal so she doesn’t overeat.

5. Cup of Milk

One cup of milk for a 10 pound cat is the caloric equivalent of five chocolate bars for a person. Besides the fact that whole milk provides 122 calories per cup — and even skim clocks in at 86 calories — neither dogs nor cats should drink it because it can upset their stomach, says Dr. Darden. A good alternative is fruits or vegetables, especially frozen, such as green beans, peas, and apples. (Ed. Note: Consult your vet before providing any "human food," as some fruits and vegetables are dangerous for pets.)

6. Peanut Butter

A single ounce of peanut butter (about a tablespoon) is close to

Last coffee season saw a massive outbreak of a devastating fungus that seemed to take everyone by surprise. The coffee leaf rust epidemic stretched from Mexico to Peru, infecting more than half of Central America’s coffee farms and costing $1 billion in crop losses. The worst affected families stripped back their entire farms, prized coffee trees reduced to kindling, and faced a stark choice – is it worth replanting when coffee prices are so low?

Oversupply coming in Brazil has caused the New York coffee price to fall through the floor, and is now likely to be below cost of production for many farmers. In this context, it is hardly surprising that many farmers and governments are investing less in coffee, which hints at a key contributing factor to the outbreak in the first place. Ageing coffee plants and chronic under investment in good farm management has left many farms in a vulnerable state. As Esperanza Dionisio, General Manager of Pangoa coffee cooperative in Peru and Twin Board Member, put it to me “it’s like tuberculosis, if you don’t eat properly, you are weakened to the disease. The leaf works in the same way; if the plant is not healthy and didn’t receive organic fertilisers, it is more susceptible to rust.”

The increase in extreme weather events in the region has also been associated with weakened coffee trees. You could therefore view this outbreak as just another symptom of climate change. Without investment, future such events are likely to be less and less surprising as changes to our climate look set to cause an upsurge in agricultural pests and diseases. Peter Baker of CABI speaking at Twin and the Fairtrade Foundation’s recent joint coffee rust industry event summed it up nicely: “think of it as an earthquake that reveals we were sitting all the time on a fault line.” So, as well as responding to this crisis, it is vital that we treat the cause and not just the symptom.

Twin’s approach to sustainable agriculture aims at strengthening overall resilience to climate change. One example is our Big Lottery Fund project in Nicaragua, which supports five Cafénica coffee cooperatives using climate field schools. Farmers can experiment and share their ideas on farm practices such as plant nutrition, soil erosion and shade management on special plots, as well as learn from experts and benefit from technology transfer. They can apply these learnings to their own farms thanks to a dedicated Smallholder Coffee Adaptation fund,

Speaking of passion, remember what makes your young heart beat. Music, words, writing, photography, powerful movies that highlight the beautiful parts of life. Don't get trapped in the mires of your everyday. Don't let the tragedy of this thing we call life paint a picture that is full of shadows. Let it go. Take off your headset and drown it out with words and life and sunlight and music and great food and lots of laughs. You're going to get off course, maybe not all the time, but sometimes you'll forget to come back to the middle. You won't get it now, but you'll get it after this great man is gone from the earth and you watch his work to understand why he will be so missed. This is how you come back to the middle, young lady.

Let love in. Just do it. Let someone love you, and not just from a distance. Don't be afraid to get your heart broken. Put out of your mind that you could never date that kind of guy, or be that sort of girlfriend, or survive that kind of love. You'll box yourself in, you'll blind yourself to the perfect imperfections of the ones who might be the exact mirror you've been looking for. Don't forget to love yourself a little too.

Move your body. Dance, do yoga, run, sweat, bend, shift, gyrate, just shake it off. Someday in the future you'll find yourself shaking and sweating and wondering why you never thought you were strong enough to run in a relay or hold a pose or climb a steep hill, and you'll love it. Then you'll lose it and wonder if you'll ever recover from pushing your body too far and you'll realize that you forgot to say no and your body said it for you. It's a hard lesson, it's painful and it will drop you to your knees and keep you up at night, but the beauty of it all is that you can still move. And all it takes is to move little and then you can move big, but you'll never lose as long as you're still moving.

Move yourself, Love.

Find your sexy. Not your slutty. Not your sleazy. Not your trying too hard. Find your own version of sexy. It's not what you think it is. It's confidence. It's subtle. It's comfortable in your own skin. It's genuine. It's your shoulder peeping out your shirt

There's a clue to the problem in that slick and showy word "smart". As the cyber-sceptic Evgeny Morozov pointed out this month, in an article at edge.org, Silicon Valley loves nothing more than proposing "smart" solutions to problems such as crime, voter apathy or climate change. Yet the word blurs a crucial distinction: a smart solution may be ingenious, but it doesn't follow that implementing it will necessarily be for the best. We can persuade people to vote, some techno-reformers argue, using clever incentives, such as shopping discounts or video game-style prizes. But should we, if it risks coarsening democracy, eroding the role of argument and deliberation in persuading people to vote? The answer may be "yes", of course. But Morozov's point is that we fail to ask such questions in the first place.

When it comes to "working smarter", the same kind of problem arises: what if doing things more "efficiently", in a superficial sense, results in doing them worse? There's evidence to suggest that we need to daydream; perhaps we also need those moments of afternoon lassitude and aimless conversations by the office microwave. Creative work, especially, depends on a kind of inefficiency. Inevitably, the scandal and schadenfreude surrounding Jonah Lehrer's book Imagine has all but drowned out its fundamental insight, but it's a good one: creative breakthroughs depend on being stumped and feeling frustrated. Make the path to them too smooth, and you get lower-quality breakthroughs.

The other, more pressing hazard concerns what you'll do with all the time you free up by working smarter: the chances are you – or your boss – will simply fill it with more work. This is the problem with most "smarter, not harder" advice: it's great on the working-more-efficiently part, but it assumes that working less hard will follow automatically. In reality, it won't. So what's the answer? On one level, it's a question of techniques: scheduling specific social activities starting soon after work, say, to ensure your increased efficiency pays off in increased leisure. But on another level, the demand for ever more output is structural, built into our jobs and the economy. Clever techniques alone won't change that. And so the danger is that we just work smarter and harder. And harder, and harder, until

“Bake something special for your neighbor, a loved one, local police or fire station or even a stranger. When you deliver it to this person, take some time to chat with them … Better yet, if you find yourself cooking up a storm, host a dinner, brunch or holiday bake-off at your house.” — Carly Long, international event planning and design firm LLG Events

Unearth your inner artist

“Instead of buying a present, be creative and make something special and personal from scratch. Have a hand at painting, baking a loaf of bread or making some organic soap.” — Marina Qutab

It takes strength to be gentle and kind

“Spend a day doing random acts of kindness, whether with a friend, your family, or just by yourself … It can be for a friend, family or strangers. It can be a fun activity to come up with these kind acts, and if you need help, there’s plenty on the internet. Some of our favorites are taping lottery tickets to car windows, giving a bouquet of flowers to a stranger, putting extra change into parking meters, paying for the coffee of the person behind you, et cetera.” — Carly Long

Put in some time

“Volunteer with your loved one. The opportunities are endless depending on your interests. Look into volunteer opportunities at your local children’s hospital, hospice,… ASPCA, food bank, homeless shelter, et cetera. You can even volunteer to watch your friend or family’s children so the adults can have a fun night out.” — Carly Long

Consider where it came from

“If you really want to give a physical new gift, consider products that help reduce waste, like a metal straw, cloth napkins, beeswax cloth food wraps, metal water bottle, travel mug or reusable grocery bag. Or give a gift certificate to their favorite store. That way they can get exactly the thing they want or need.” — Aran Galligan, designer of eco-friendly jewelry line Aide-mémoire Jewelry

Lose (or re-use) the wrapping paper

If you do want to give a physical gift, think twice about how you’re presenting it. A lot of holiday waste comes from wrapping and packaging that’s used only once and thrown away.

“Most mass-produced wrapping paper can’t be recycled due to the shiny

A chemical reaction happens when cannabis is heated. During this reaction, the amount of THC in a product can actually increase based on the strength of the plant.

THC and total THC are both listed on the packaging of every product. Look at the total THC to know the maximum amount of THC you may ingest when you use cannabis. This higher THC percentage will give you the best idea of how cannabis will affect you.

Ways to Use Cannabis

What are cannabis oils?

Cannabis oils are extractions of THC and/or CBD from the cannabis plant that are in carrier oils like olive, grapeseed or coconut oils. Cannabis oils will be available for sale in licensed cannabis stores. Cannabis oils can be used by placing droplets under the tongue or by infusing into edibles.

Unlike dried cannabis, the THC and CBD contents of cannabis oils are listed in mg/ml instead of a percentage. You’ll see ranges of less than 1 mg/ml up to 30 mg/ml. Like dried cannabis, it’s always best to start with a lower level of THC and an equal or higher level of CBD.

If you’re using cannabis oils, check to make sure you’re not allergic to the ingredients, as they may contain peanuts, soy or other allergens.

What are edibles?

Cannabis edibles are products infused with THC, the intoxicating compound from the cannabis plant. Edibles could also be infused with CBD. THC and CBD can be added into edible products like brownies, muffins, candies, juice, etc. Edibles will not be available for retail sale on October 17, 2018, but legal users can make their own.

Consuming edibles is safer for your lungs than smoking or vaping cannabis, but it can take much longer (up to 2 hours) before you feel the effects, which increases the risk of overdose. If you’re making edibles, estimate the amount of THC in milligrams and portion out serving sizes of less than 3 mg to 5 mg, especially if you’re new to cannabis. Start with one serving and wait at least 90 minutes before you consume more, so that your body can metabolize the edible and you feel the effects.

Buying Cannabis

Where can I buy legal cannabis?

In Manitoba, you can only buy legal cannabis from a cannabis retailer

Sophomores Corrie Reiley and Clare Kramer have been in the fold all season, and junior Karlie Stafford has developed into the girl who does all the dirty work after winning the fifth starter job at the beginning of the year.

When you include senior standouts Cassie Reiley and Riley Walters and a deep bench featuring the likes of senior Molly Corbin, juniors Brooke Remley and Kaeli Kovarik, and sophomore Cydney Westen, the Prophets have a lot of players with postseason experience.

“Everybody has a valuable part on this team,” Stafford said. “The whole bench has something to bring to the team, and we’ve all played together all year now instead of throwing in some younger girls at the end of the season like last year.

“We all just have to do our parts, communicate on defense and just give it our all. We’ve been looking forward to this game all season, and we don’t want to have any regrets.”

Last year’s 36-24 loss to Aquin has been in the back of the Prophets’ minds ever since last February. Within two points early in the fourth quarter, Prophetstown went cold from the field, and the Bulldogs closed the game with a 10-0 run in arguably their toughest game en route to the state title.

Kramer, who was making just her second varsity start, remembers being as nervous as she’s ever been. This time around, she believes the experience of playing in that atmosphere will be a big help – as will the fan bus Prophetstown will be taking to the game.

“I’m getting really excited for this game, and I think the other girls are, too,” Kramer said. “It was a really good battle last year, and I’m looking forward to playing Sophie again; she’s probably the best player I’ve ever defended, and it’s a challenge to stop her.

“But I think us playing her last year, we’re going to be much better about calming those nerves down. I think we’ll play with a lot more confidence, and it will really be in our favor if we keep the game at our tempo and execute well.”

Cost Calculations for Freelance Web Designing in London, UK

Fortunately, this article is for those in need of information regarding the costs of web design as a whole. Please continue reading to learn more about it.

Service prices are dependent upon price averages within each agency. These can only be used for estimates. To get accurate quote, contact your target designer.

Why Should You Hire A Freelancer For Web Design in London?

For Convenience

Freelancers are usually hired for the sake of convenience. Getting someone who doesn’t need to sign an official contract to get the job done will have less complications and commitment from the company as compared to hiring a brand new employee.

Individualized Services

By working with a freelance website designer in London, UK, chances are you would be working with only a single person.

This leads to a more personalized brand of service as well as the freelancer taking much of your wants and needs into consideration prior to beginning the project. This is a significant factor to consider especially when designing your very own business website. This is because it will be the first avenue for communication you will have with your potential clients.

Variety of Skills

Freelancers tend to have more skills and a variety of other talents to complement web design as compared to the typical agency designer which are more specialized in terms of skill. This because many freelancers do not stop learning new sets of abilities.

Because of this, and they become more equipped to handle versatile design projects and customized websites.

More Experience

Freelancers have a wider range of experiences when it comes to web design as opposed to the common agency designer. Being able to work with different companies as well as varied sectors in society means more flexibility for the freelancer.

Freelancers tend to run in the same circles as their colleagues.This means that they will be able to collaborate with others effectively in case they don’t know how to work on certain aspects of the project down the line.

The Prospect of Aftercare

Most agencies do offer aftercare services. However, once the site in question goes live, and when the entire project is essentially finished. This

But yeah, the MIDI controller should be no problem, but I never had any intention of actually playing the songs in real time on a keyboard. I feel as though repairing the wing of an F-16 fighter jet would be less difficult, for lack of a better metaphor.

I haven't done any scorewriting myself yet, but I do know that there's an alternative to programs like Finale or Sibelius. LilyPond, definitely not as user friendly as those proprietary softwares, but it gets the work done and the result is like very high quality music engraving. If you're familiar with LaTeX, LilyPond is like its equivalent for score writing.

At the end of the day, I guess it doesn't really matter what you decide do write them with, but it's an option that you could look into.

Guitar Pro automatically transcribes tabs to scores, also it plays the entire song on midi instrument imitations, but it sounds like shit from what I know.Close to a World Below would be interesting, At the Gates - Primal Breath?

MIDI controllers are not that much more helpful than knowing the hotkeys. I would save your money.

I don't think metal is complex/specialized enough to need notation yet, but I guess it would be an interesting project for archival purposes. Just make sure you don't suck at aural dictation, so we don't get a situation like what happened with "The Real Book", where half the songs contain blatant errors because the kids at Berklee who did the transcriptions didn't know what the fuck they were doing.

If you want to actually buy the program, Guitar Pro is only $50. However, Finale has superior sounding virtual instruments.

Guitar Pro might be a good start to this project. I'm definitely not looking for quality virtual sound, simple MIDI effects will work fine, as long as every note that the stringed instruments are playing are represented at equal volume, all with the same effect so it sounds as if it's all being played on one big keyboard. The broad range of tones all being played at once will all be heard, even by people who claim that even the best metal is just noise, people that have no experience to the genre but are still drawn to ambient and classical. I have no doubt that the final product will be something that resembles ambient.

I did this one just for

Missouri highway engineers are seeking public comment on alternatives to improve Interstate 70 within Kansas City that could include closing access at some interchanges. On and off ramps that could be closed include those at Brooklyn Avenue, Benton Boulevard, Truman Road, 18th Street, 27th Street and Manchester Trafficway.

Missouri highway engineers are seeking public comment on alternatives to improve Interstate 70 within Kansas City that could include closing access at some interchanges.

On and off ramps that could be closed include those at Brooklyn Avenue, Benton Boulevard, Truman Road, 18th Street, 27th Street and Manchester Trafficway.

The Missouri Department of Transportation previously wanted to close the Manchester interchange because it was considered too near to Interstate 435. But the state was persuaded to shelve the idea when businesses in the area protested. That proposal, however, is still among the alternatives being considered.

The suggestions are part of a menu of ideas that also includes improving other interchanges, adding lanes and improving the Benton and Jackson curves.

An earlier stage of the study estimated that improving key bottlenecks would cost $160 million for right-of-way acquisition and $630 million for construction.

“There is currently no funding for design and construction,” project manager Allan Zafft acknowledged in a statement. “But completing this study is an important step in having the project ready to go should funding become available.”

I-70 in Kansas City was built more than 50 years ago and was designed to last 20 years. It carries far more traffic now than was anticipated — nearly 95,000 vehicles a day downtown and nearly 113,000 a day near Kauffman Stadium.

So highway engineers are studying ways to improve safety and conditions on the 6.8 miles from the Paseo to the Blue Ridge Cutoff. Officials say that section is experiencing pavement and bridge deterioration, has traffic delays and congestion and has issues with traffic merging and weaving.

MoDOT is seeking suggestions from the public at a series of meetings planned in February and online through Feb. 25 at

An analysis of crash data found that eight people died in eight accidents on that stretch of I-70 from 2006 to 2010, and there were 32 crashes that resulted in disabling injuries. The largest percentage of crashes were rear-enders, accounting for 48 percent of accidents.

The highway is only going to get more congested without improvements. The population of Jackson County is expected to grow by nearly 21 percent by

Student Support

If you aren’t able to resolve an issue directly or with the help of an advisor, faculty or staff member:

Transart Collegium MeetingsTransart Collegium Meetings—made up of student representatives (MFA and PhD) and Transart faculty and staff representatives—are an internal Transart-only forum in which any issues that arise are brought forward for resolution. There is a collegium meeting at each residency and additional collegium meetings can be called (held via Skype) at any time between residencies when Transart is in session. For both issues and ideas, request your student, faculty or staff rep add an agenda item to the next collegium meeting, or between residencies to call a collegium meeting by Skype.* If you are a rep and have an issue personally, you will request another rep to represent you.

All agenda are due from reps to all collegium members, 48 hours in advance. If you have an issue you will state your issue; goal; and desired outcome in writing 48 hours in advance of a meeting. Only agenda items submitted on time can be reviewed. Another meeting may be called for new items at any time at a residency or by Skype.

Meeting chair and minute taker may rotate by rep request

Minutes and outcome reports will be sent by email to all current students, faculty, instructors, or advisors, and staff via weblink expiring within 2 weeks (when in session). All minutes will be filed in the Transart Cloud and are accessible via the School Manager at any time the institute is in session. Minutes and Outcome Reports are filed and stored in the Transart Cloud.

a. Add more air ventilation
The lack of air ventilation will lead to poor air distribution. For that reason, you need to open your window or your house to help improve air circulation in your house. It’s because if the air continues to settle into your house, it will lead to a humid condition and may bring many diseases.

b. Checks Radon in Your Home
Radon – considered as a risk factor for lung cancer – the substance could be in your own home, says the Mayo Clinic. It is a highly dangerous radioactive gas that is odorless and tasteless and is derived from the soil. The only way to know if your home has radon is to conduct a test which quick and easy and only takes a few minutes of your time. EPA provides a way of testing the substance in a short-term and long-term way. It’s to check the radon on their website.

Other than that, we also need to check the old asbestos material, like I said in my previous post here, asbestos is so dangerous and you need to ask some who offer the trusted services. Just for your info, if you live in Brisbane Australia, you can ask and read more about asbestos removal Brisbane in this site.

c. The smoke from cigarettes
The smoke from cigarettes causing odors and can lead to passive smokers at risk of suffering from various illnesses such as sinusitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, and worsen asthma symptoms. A cigarette will leave residue on the floors, carpets, sofas and cushions. Besides that, it will leave unpleasant scent. This condition can be harmful to children who often play in the area.

d. Gas and stove
The LPG gas and stoves can release carbon monoxide leak that can cause fatigue, headaches, nausea, and even death, while nitrogen dioxide can lead to respiratory problems. That’s why you need to ensuring your LPG gas and stoves installed correctly. It’s better to place the object near a window or air vent, as well as installing the fan so that the gas will not remain within your house.

SEC: Vandy making waves; LSU also paid Lyles

I guess we should stop rolling our eyes now. The events of last week prove that there is much, much more to James Franklin than a firm handshake and effervescent personality. He not only talks a good game; he also recruits a good game.

SEC commissioner Mike Slive indicated there wasn’t so much as a whisper about expansion at the conference’s spring meetings last month. I get sad just thinking about it. I’ve been following the SEC long enough to qualify as a traditionalist, but I’m also a realist. The nation’s best conference could become even better – and wealthier – by expanding. And its tradition wouldn’t have to be destroyed in the process.

But enjoying a chuckle at Oregon’s expense may be whistling past a graveyard. LSU also paid Lyles $6,000 for recruiting services. While this is not to imply that LSU is guilty of any wrongdoing along the lines of what happened at Oregon, at the very least Lyles is one of the last people whose name you want associated with your program.

Tonya Bray, the mother of Auburn freshman football player Quan Bray, was shot and killed Sunday morning in LaGrange, Ga., police said. Jeff Jones, who is listed as Quan’s father in his official Auburn biography, turned himself in to police about an hour after the shooting.

Cheek hasn’t been around long enough for anyone to get a firm read on him – except, perhaps, Hill – since he didn’t arrive from the University of Florida until 2008. But that also means he was on board for Fulmer’s messy departure, the unsatisfying hire of Lane Kiffin and, most recently, the Bruce Pearl debacle, which had Cheek’s fingerprints all over it.

The rush to join Twitter, Facebook and other social media websites could possibly include trampling on First Amendment rights. That’s why most college coaches and administrators proceed cautiously in setting boundaries – if any – as their athletes join in the very public conversation.

Auburn now moves back to Plan A in looking for a new quarterback.

Based on that, I spent some time thinking about what I used to shoot with my old AE1 and what I shoot now, and what, besides the quality, is different. Here are my thoughts – hopefully some of the old-timers will jump in here and correct any misconceptions on my part.

First, I need to debunk my memories of those old ‘perfect’ shots I captured on film. Back in those days, I didn’t shoot anywhere near the volume of the pros, but I did go through several rolls a week for quite a while. In the first place, my memory of these great shots, were of the ones I actually kept. I remember sitting in the mall outside the photo processing lab, flipping through the 4x6s, thinking – good, good, crap, crap, crap, good, etc. The crap went into the nearest trash can. Secondly, I very rarely had anything printed larger than 4×6. If I looked at everything today at 4×6 instead of 32×48, many more of them would look just fine. Conversely, if I had all those old film shots printed three feet wide, they would probably all be crap.

Second, I need to rethink what is perfect. I remember a class I took back in my film days, and the teacher showed us an image he shot for an ad on Fuji 25. He was trying to drum into us the value of using slide film and told us that he could blow that image up to billboard size and it would still be perfect. Would any image today meet that test? No. And here’s the reason why. On film, especially at that speed, the camera captured an almost perfect copy of what the eye saw. In today’s world, no matter how good the camera is, it captures its interpretation of the world, based on a programmer’s logic, in pixels. Most of you think of pixels as dots of color, and that’s almost correct, except they are really squares of color. The world (and especially the light reflected from it) isn’t made up of squares. You take one of a pro’s old film shots and blow it up as large as you want and it will still be perfect. Do the same with their best work today and around 300% or so, it is going to start looking like crap, because all those little jagged edges of squares become more apparent. They are not shooting perfect images. What they are doing that

Annanda believes that grants like the FTE project can bring future generations of seminarians into a greater understanding of how to fill social and cultural gaps present in the church. “I feel that these cultural gaps are so important because Christ's teachings directly speak of the disconnect between the culture of the religious powers and the cultures of the world outside the four walls.”

She said, "this next generation coming up not only sees these differences but is willing to step outside of their comfort zone being in solidarity with those who have been ignored or marginalized by society; and, like Christ, I see this generation being willing to be outcasts themselves so that others may participate in the beloved community."

She expresses a hope that the future of the church will be rooted in this communal, radical expression of Christian love. Seminarians in particular have begun to manifest this practice of familial love in their development as innovators and ministers.

"This generation will do this with the help and support of each other," Barclay said. "We recognize that all humanity is quite literally members of our family in Christ."

All FTE fellows undergo a rigorous discernment process for eight months with four other fellows, and then begin work on their project in the late spring or early summer. In August, all grant recipients meet at FTE headquarters in Atlanta to present their projects.

Annanda is still in the discernment process for her project, and the Seminary community is looking forward to what she and other ministry fellows will create and how their projects will speak God's love for the whole world.

Because I was making this dress on a budget, I opted to do mine in a base layer of white slipper satin lined in bleached cotton muslin and an over layer of mirror organza.

The next problem was the pattern for the dress. It appears that the front does have some sort of hook and eye openings (or so I thought at one point), but the dress is back closing with fabric covered buttons. The bodice is two layers, one strapless with a sweetheart neckline and the other the higher, sheer v neckline. I discovered this pattern from Butterick:

Butterick 5556

The basic construction was nearly identical to the notes I had taken of photos of Princess Margaret's dress. I opted to do full sleeves, ditch the standing collar and belt, and make it full length. The pattern itself was only used as a jumping off point, most of the dress was draped either on me or my dress form (Margaret).

Now that my wedding dress is done and I'm in the middle of writing thank you notes, cleaning up my house, trying to plan our honeymoon trip, and finishing the painting from before Christmas...I think it's time for some new work clothes.

I've had plenty of time to think about the things I do and do not like or agree with. While my views on the lack of historically appropriate clothing by and large in Columbia have not changed and I certainly do not mean that everyone associated fits into that category, I have not done my part to help the matter. I think I tried to do too much at once and in the end discovered a few things to make my agenda more do-able. Change has to happen slowly; perhaps trying to make clothing appropriate for an "upper middle class" English or French woman was too ambitious and the people around me were not ready. Perhaps fashions inspired by Empress Sissi were mentioned too soon for the park. They need to be broken in gradually.


Reuters had reported in March talks of the investment in ATG.

Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said that the funding “will help maintain Uber’s position at the forefront of” a transforming transportation industry.

The funding allows Uber to transfer some of the substantial cost of developing self-driving cars onto outside investors. That is likely to appease some of Wall Street’s concerns over Uber’s spending on the autonomous unit, which has topped $1.07 billion since the program started in 2016.

In its filing for an initial public offering this month, Uber cautioned that development of self-driving technology “is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful” and the company lagged certain competitors.

The self-driving business unit brings in no meaningful revenue for Uber, which last year lost $3.03 billion.

As part of the investment, ATG becomes its own legal entity but remains under the control of Uber. A new ATG board will be formed, with six directors appointed from Uber, one from SoftBank and one from Toyota. Eric Meyhofer, currently the head of ATG, will take the title of CEO and report to the new board.

Such sizeable deals are unusual for companies so close to an IPO, because bringing in large new investors changes the company’s capital structure.

Uber is preparing to launch its “roadshow,” when it will pitch its company prospective investors, the week of April 29, setting up for an early May debut on the New York Stock Exchange. It is expected to raise $10 billion at a $90 billion to $100 billion valuation.

NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS

The transaction is expected to close the third quarter. The deal, however, will almost certainly require approval from the inter-agency regulatory group called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).

A law enacted last year expands that group’s powers to review minority stakes by foreign investors in startups with certain sensitive technologies, and self-driving technology is widely considered to have defence applications.

SoftBank’s investment in General Motors Co’s self-driving car unit Cruise is still under CFIUS review and is likely weeks away from any decision, even though that investment was announced nearly a year ago.

Both SoftBank and Toyota are repeat Uber investors. SoftBank took a more than 16 percent stake in the company after investing around $

"So, she is my friend and all, I really think you better be really nice. Because, like, I got LOTS of friends, and ya. I do. And I really love Matty, more than you can ever know. So ya. If you ever hurt her, I will kick your ass," she said. Does she really think she can kick my ass? Man that'd be embarrassing. Better think of a battle tactic. I could like, you know, just push her over. Then she'd be like a turned-over turtle. Ya, that could work.

"Do you hear me?" she interrupted, "I am serious, I am pretty and all, but I can hurt."

Wow, fat, ugly, and conceited, where did Matty pick this little number up? Or not pick up, it is physically impossible to pick her up...so more like, tow her.

"I am sure you can," I replied calmly. We hadn't talked for a while. We were just staring at each other...just bored. Where was Matty? Oh wow, it is kinda awkward now. Maybe I should say something. Hmm...OH I GOT IT!

"OH! I have a joke. Okay okay, so there was a man, and he hired a hooker for only 5 bucks. The next day he calls up the hooker and says, 'Hey why didn't you tell me you had crabs? I have them now?' And the hooker replies, 'It was only five dollars, what'd you expect, lobster?'" I finished, waiting for a response.

She didn't laugh. She sat a while before standing up and slapping me across the face. "MATTY!" she screamed, "Help me!"

"He is coming on to me! He said I had crabs, and I was a hooker and he paid me five dollars," Stacy said.

Oh come on, she can't be serious! "No, no!" I said, Matty ran out crying, I called out, "IT WAS JUST A JOKE!"

"WHAT THE HELL STACY!" I yelled. I ran after Matty but she wasn't anywhere to be found. I ran down stairs, then saw Matty upstairs, so I climbed back up. I went to her room but the door was locked.

This story first appeared on Indian Country Today Media Network in May 2015. For an August 2015 update, go here.

A federal judge has shredded claim after claim by a South Dakota county that overlaps the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation but will not guarantee tribal members on-reservation voter registration and in-person absentee voting (sometimes dubbed “early voting”). In future, Jackson County wants all residents to continue traveling to the courthouse in the county seat, Kadoka, to access the full range of voting services. Tribal members, including Oglala Sioux Nation vice president and lead plaintiff Tom Poor Bear, sued. They say the county’s stance violates the Voting Rights Act and the Fourteenth Amendment, guaranteeing equal rights. The county defendants came back with a motion that the suit, Poor Bear v. The County of Jackson,be dismissed. Judge Karen Schreier turned the county down, repeatedly opining that the

A PC edition of Twilight Struggle has been successfully Kickstarted , giving the tactically-minded a crunchy slab of world-domination to get excited about. Two players control competing superpowers in the post-war era in a beautifully balanced battle for global influence. It's big, complex, and will surely be brilliant online, if GMT Games get it right.

The game is full of clever touches. You fight for victory points on a tug-of-war track, and earn them by accruing influence in cities across the world. You play cards to do this, but each card is a world event that may have negative consequences for your nation. You'll think things like "I can have these influence points, but do I want to unleash Che Guevara in the process?" and "if I play influence in the Middle East I'll gain dominance in the region, but is it worth triggering the Cuban missile crisis to do it?" Chancers can also gamble on the space race to earn some cheeky victory points.

The original boardgame was designed by Jason Matthews and Ananda Gupta, who was the lead designer of XCOM: Enemy Within, and a senior designer on XCOM: Enemy Unknown. It was released in 2005, and still has a lively competitive community, with regular tournaments. The backer rewards mention online tournaments that players can pay to enter and compete for prizes.

As anyone who's tried to unfold the four-foot board in a pub will know, Twilight Struggle's physical form is quite cumbersome. It's a game of many counters, cards, and progress trackers that ought to benefit greatly from a digitised edition. GMT say it'll "include a game tutorial to help players understand the game fairly quickly, AI opponents to allow you to sharpen your skills, pass-and-play multiplayer, and both asynchronous and real-time online play". The Kickstarter bid flew past the $50,000 target and is currently lingering around the $110k mark, which has activated several stretch goals, including the addition of five singleplayer scenarios.

At the moment it looks like you have to spend $30 to get the PC version, which comes with a physical version of the What If? expansion and a pack of promo cards. According to GMT, "the game is expected to be complete by February 2015". Hopefully it'll introduce the game to a big new audience. I look forward to total defeat at the hands of strategy master

A belated Easter Egg

OK, here’s a late Easter Egg treat for you all. Ages ago I saw the Michael Greco/Michael Scorsese time lapse video, and thought to myself “that looks like a good idea”. So I had a go myself earlier this year.

The first attempt was a bit of a washout – I used a cheapy webcam, which, whilst it kept the file sizes down, was such low quality it was unwatchable. Then I tried again with a 1D mark II tethered to the Laptop, and this time I was much more successful.

The shoot was a cover and inside feature shoot for Inside Poker magazine of Tony G, a regular on the international poker circuit. The brief was “Power Play”, and we were trying to get as much emotion out of Tony as possible. Given how bloody cold it was in the studio he did a superb job – one of those shoots where once I’ve set the lights up I can simply point the camera and press the button.

We were shooting at 3 Mills, out in the East End of London, as Tony and many others were there filming some Poker TV show or other. The studio was very accomodating, but there seemed to be a problem with the heating in the room we were using! I had enough time at the end of the shoot to try out a lighting test that I’d been mulling over for a little while. It’s not finished yet, but I felt I’d better leave it in the film for the sake of honesty.

I’ve never edited video before, so it took quite a bit of fiddling in Adobe Premiere to get this together. The jaunty background music is by Kevin MacLeod, and was free to download and use – I think it works rather well. This sort of thing only lends itself to some of the work I shoot – lots of my location shoots just wouldn’t be suitable as I move around too much, and would have to keep continually unplugging the camera and laptop.

You can play “I Spy” with the video in the following ways:

The Backdrops/Props didn’t arrive until almost half way through. Spot how many times you can see Rich, the art director, on the phone trying to chase them up.

– Saban also needled the media in regards to predictions. In the last 21 seasons, according to Saban, the media has picked the SEC champ just four times. “If as a coach I had a 4-17 record, I’d be back in West Virginia pumping gas,” Saban said.

– Saban said that “it’s a challenge every year to re-invent your team.”

– Alabama does open with Virginia Tech — “which has been a 10-team win team almost every year,” Saban said — then a road game at Texas A&M, the one team that beat last year’s Alabama team.

– Saban was asked about the no-huddle offense and his previously voiced concerns about player’s safety. Saban didn’t really go back into his appeal and said he didn’t think the rules would change in that regard. He’s not a fan of the uptempo attacks.

“Should we allow football to be a continous game? Is that the way the game was designed to play?” he said is one issue. The other is the “increased number of plays that players play in the game are there any safety issues in that.”

– As for the Bryant comparisons, Saban said there was no comparison because Bryant did it over a longer period of time in so many different ways. And also Bryant should be measured not by titles but the affect he had on his players.

“Bear Bryant is probably the greatest coach ever in college football,” Saban said. “The biggest thing is his impact (on) many players (in) positive ways. They all come back and say how he affected their life”

And this: “There’s no way that we’ve done anything close to what he’s done his consistency over time.”

– Saban was asked if he understood Les Miles’ scheduling concerns. LSU plays Florida and Georgia this year from the SEC East, while Alabama plays Kentucky and Tennessee. Miles wants an “equal path” to the championship.

“There can never e an equal path to the championship,” Saban said. “Unless

Whenever there is a vicious storm or some other type of catastrophe, it never fails that Americans get in gear and do their best to assist others in need. As Hurricane Harvey devastated Texas and Irma did her worst in Florida and Georgia, the best in America rallied to their aid and it was a very heartwarming thing to see.

In the course of modern American history, however, it has become a tradition of the Left to ensure that not only is someone a victim of this havoc, but someone is ultimately to blame. If it is a government entity, its an elected official. If it’s not an elected official, it’s a talk radio show host.

When it comes down to it, the Left finds it very lucrative and enjoyable to have an opportunity to blame someone…anyone for the disasters that take place, especially when they can link them to Global Warming or man-made issues. Celebrities, of course, always manage to take their whack at the Republican Party as well. True to form, Stevie Wonder decided that going political during a rescue and recovery telethon effort was more important than the people who were hurting!

The Daily Caller:

Singer Stevie Wonder kicked off Tuesday’s star studded Hand In Hand telethon to raise money for hurricane recovery by getting political. Wonder started the show by saying, “Anyone who believes that there’s no such thing as global warming must be blind or unintelligent.”

The Hand In Hand telethon was run on every broadcast network to benefit victims of hurricanes Harvey, which devastated the Houston area, and Irma, which slammed Florida over the weekend. The event mirrors past telethons for natural disasters.

The 2005 telethon to raise money for victims of Hurricane Katrina became known for Kanye West’s infamous anti-President George W. Bush comments. “George Bush doesn’t care about black people,” West said as a stunned Mike Meyers looked on.

In addition to musical performances, celebrities took phone calls during Tuesday’s telethon from people making pledges to help those in need.

Interestingly, the whole Comic Relief show that was made famous on HBO for its charity work, was also ensconced in scandal once upon a time when it was discovered that 80% of the donations and proceeds had gone to pay the comics themselves.

When it comes to the Left and its useful idiots in Hollywood, there is no shameful when it

The SukanyaSamriddhi Account is basically a scheme that has been started by the government of the country with a vision to help the girl child in the country. According to this saving scheme the parents or the guardian of the girl child can deposit up to Rs. 1.5 lakhs in the name of the girl child every year in this account. Once the deposit is made in the account it accrues an interest at the rate of about 9.2% per annum and has a maturity period of 21 years from the date of opening of the savings account or marriage whichever is earlier.

The SukanyaSamriddhi Account can be opened with a minimum amount of Rs.1, 000 and consequently the deposits that are made have to be multiples of Rs.100. This girl child saving account also allows partial withdrawal when the girl child turns 18 years old, in order to supports expenses with regards to her education as well as marriage. An extra advantage of this girl child saving scheme is that, the investments in this account needs to be made only for the first 14 years, after which no deposits are required to be made in the account. The credit amount in this account at the end of 14 years will continue to accrue interest until this scheme matures. The maximum amount that an individual can earn in this account with investing Rs.1.5 lakhs every year for 14 years at the rate of 9.2% interest per annum is Rs.78, 90,763.

There are many advantages to the SukanyaSamriddhi Scheme, but here are some of the most important ones:

This scheme allows an individual to know exactly the maturity value once the account matures.

If you set this scheme up in an excel sheet, you can put up the amount you intend to invest in this scheme currently and you can see how it will affect your maturity amount.

One could also set up the calculator to calculate the maturity value of the investment on a monthly or yearly basis.

The SukanyaSamriddhi Account calculator could be extremely precise if it is configured correctly.

Once can also change the amount you intend to invest at any point of time and can still get the accurate maturity value in a matter of a few seconds.

Being an ELSS scheme the SukanyaSamriddhi Account calculator also acts as an ELSS calculatorand you can also calculate and work out the total amount you intend to invest in

We meet for four hours a day, five days a week, for seven weeks. That time includes twice-weekly generative writing workshops, field trips, and professional visitors (we’re having a published author, a performer from Second City, and a professional storyteller this summer), plus ample time for self-directed reading and writing. Any working adult writer would be jealous and covetous of the experience, I am quite sure!

CC:Do you think there are any societal barriers that can prevent youth from exploring creative writing?

KB: Something that is really important to a child’s aptitude for reading and writing is the value that is placed on these activities in the home, and within their communities. You might assume that for an economically disadvantaged or socially marginalized family, less value is placed on abstract literacy skills and more on vocational skills that can tangibly lead to employment, but I have not found this to be true. Our team for Summer Matters represents a very wide range of culture, class, and ethnicity from every corner and neighborhood of Chicago: public school kids from the impoverished south and west side and private school kids from affluent Lincoln Park. Somewhere along the lines of their lives someone has demonstrated to them that reading and writing are fun, interesting and worthy pursuits, and these kids have taken that to heart.

CC:What do you think youth gain from writing? Do their perspectives of themselves and the world shift as they pursue creative writing?

KB: Creative writing helps affirm to young people that their experiences and lives are interesting and have value and merit. It gives them confidence in the power of their own voices and that their voices and perspectives matter. It also allows students to practice abstract thinking and creative problem solving (what happens next? What needs to happen to get this story where you want it to be?), which are higher levels of thinking. Reading fiction has been demonstrated to increase a person’s empathy, their ability to put themselves in someone else’s shoes and understand that the world is bigger than their small fraction of it. How can you even quantify the value of any of these individual outcomes, let alone all of them in combination?

CC:What are some of the challenges you face in teaching creative writing to youth?

KB: They are often the same challenges I get teaching creative writing to adults – getting them to trust their voices and their imaginations, to not censor themselves or pull back; encouraging them to keep going, to

Ms. Haidar is married to Ms. Badawi’s brother, Raif Badawi, who was arrested in 2012 and sentenced to ten years in prison and 1,000 lashes for promoting freedom of expression and women’s rights.

In a rare public distancing from the Salmans, Saudi Prince Ahmed bin Abdelaziz – one of the few still living sons of the founder of Saudi Arabia and a younger brother of King Salman, asked anti-Saudi protesters on a London street chanting “down, down Al Saud” and “Al Saud criminal family”: “What does the al-Saud family have to do with your chants? We have nothing to do with what is happening (in Yemen). Certain officials are responsible.”

Asked by protesters who he held responsible, Prince Ahmed, who served as deputy interior minister for 37 years and briefly as interior minister under King Salman’s predecessor, King Abdullah, said “the king and his heir apparent,” a reference to King Salman and Prince Mohammed.

The state-run Saudi News Agency subsequently quoted Prince Ahmed as seeking to roll back his comments captured on video by saying that he said that “the King and the Crown Prince are responsible for the state and its decisions. This is true for the security and stability of the country and the people.”

In a bid to stymie criticism, Saudi prosecutors this week reportedly sought the death penalty against prominent cleric Salman Al-Odah who was detained a year ago.

“The Saudi attorney general accused my father @salman_alodah of 37 charges and asked for his execution,” his son Abdullah said in a tweet. He said some of the charges were related to comments Mr. Al-Odah had posted on Twitter and membership in organizations associated with Qatar and Qatari-Egyptian Islamic scholar Sheikh Yousef al-Qaradawi, who is close to the Muslim Brotherhood. Mr. Al-Odah has 14 million Twitter followers.

Applying a cost-benefit analysis, The Kings College/Oxford Research Group report concluded that, contrary to the projections of the government of Prime Minister Theresa May and popular perception, Britain enjoyed limited economic benefit from its relationship with Saudi Arabia while suffering considerable reputational damage.

The report noted that Britain’s $8 billion in exports to Saudi Arabia accounted for a mere one percent of total exports in 2016. The British Treasury reaped $38.5 million in revenues from

March 2017 ICMA writes to Olivier Guersent (Director General of DG-FISMA) and Steven Maijoor (Chair of ESMA) informing them of changes to the ICMA ‘buy-in rules’. In light of the consultation that precipitated and informed the update to the ICMA secondary market rules and recommendations buy-in procedure, ICMA also highlights to the Commission and ESMA its concerns with respect to the projected implementation of the mandatory buy-in regime under CSDR.Letter to Olivier GuersentLetter to Steven Maijoor

March 2016 ICMA publishes a paper illustrating the problems arising from an asymmetry in the proposed CSDR mandatory buy-in process that only allows for the settlement of the buy-in or cash compensation price differential to be paid in one direction. Conventional buy-in processes, such as under ICMA Rules, allow for the payment of the buy-in differential to be paid in either direction between the buyer and seller, depending on whether the buy-in price is higher or lower than the original trade price. This ensures an equitable remedy, with neither the buyer or seller incurring an undue profit or loss as a result of the buy-in. The CSDR buy-in process, however, only allows for the payment to be made by the seller to the buyer in the event that the buy-in price (or cash compensation reference price) is higher than the original trade price. From a risk perspective, this asymmetry is the equivalent of any seller of securities also writing a free at-the-money put option which will become active in the event of a buy-in. Conversely, any purchaser of securities will be long this free option.

ICMA is hopeful that ESMA and the European Commission will address this highly technical, but fundamental, anomaly before attempting implementation of the mandatory buy-in regime, currently projected for early 2019.

Since the publication of the Level 1 draft text of CSDR Regulation, ICMA has been highly engaged in cross-industry advocacy related to the Regulation’s provisions for settlement discipline, in particular mandatory buy-ins, which is broadly recognised as having a potentially detrimental impact on European bond and repo market liquidity and efficiency.

1 February 2016 ESMA published the long-awaited draft RTS for mandatory buy-ins. Given the restrictions of the Level 1 text, and the concerns raised by earlier draft RTS, the final draft RTS attempt to strike a balance between consistency with the intent of

I love fall when the leaves turn their bright colors, the air is crisp and the farmers market is alive with the abundance of the harvest. I always feel a pull to turn inward, make soup and laze around more, though the outer world doesn’t always support that. There is a great paradox being reflected in nature this time of year. As the trees turn their brilliant colors, they remind us of our hearts’ inner brilliance and as the leaves fall, we know on some level we are being asked to let go. In this way, nature gives us permission to let old patterns fall apart and go back to the void so we can clear the way for something new to emerge.

One of my favorite Hindu goddesses is Kali who is also known as the Goddess of Destruction. When you first see an image of her, she looks scary but she is actually quite beautiful in her rawness. Kali shows up commonly in yogic art. She is the one with the wild hair, the bare breasts and the severed heads around her neck. She usually carries a sword and one of the ways you know it’s her is that she is sticking out her tongue.

Kali represents the energy of death, darkness and uncertainty in each of us. She cuts through the illusions of the ego. She is also the void. Most of us are terrified of this energy within us, so we turn our back on it and it goes into the shadow—coming out as resentment, repressed anger and a disconnection with the mother archetype. This dark and scary place is often where we carry our most tender wounds. When we have the courage to go into the darkness and meet our deepest fears and wounds, we’re able to feel more and allow our raw emotions to move and express themselves. When integrated into the heart, these wounds become our true beauty. In her many teachings, Kali gives us the opportunity to pause, to stop the busyness and ask ourselves, “What do I really value?” This mother goddess tells us that death is not a problem but an opportunity to turn toward life.

I’ve been admiring all the different leaves as they fall from the trees, each one carrying their own unique hue of reds, yellows, bright oranges and browns. Some small, some large with various shapes and textures, all beautiful in their own way as they dance in the autumn winds, falling and composting back to the same place our bodies will go someday—return

“These findings are concerning,” says principal investigator Edward Mills, professor in the Interdisciplinary School of Health Sciences at the University of Ottawa and Canada Research Chair in Global Health. “Wealthy countries are trying to strengthen the health systems of Africa and are providing essential medicines, but they are benefitting from Africa’s financial loss in training health workers that emigrate to the wealthier settings.”

The authors are now calling for destination countries to invest in training and health systems in the source countries.

“No one is saying that people should not be permitted to make decisions about where they live or want to succeed in their careers,” says Dr. Nathan Ford, a study author from the University of Cape Town, South Africa. “But how can we make progress in building health systems when local university budgets and school places are depleted by physicians who then go and work in a wealthy nation?”

The migration of health workers from poor countries contributes to weak health systems in low-income countries and is considered a primary threat to achieving the health-related Millennium Development Goals, says the study.

“While wealthy countries are benefitting from the doctors who choose to move, there is a responsibility to ensure we are not damaging local health systems in Africa,” adds study author Ivy Bourgeault, professor in the Interdisciplinary School of Health Sciences at the University of Ottawa and CIHR Health Canada Research Chair in Human Resources for Health Policy. “Some countries, such as the USA, have recognized this and pledged to train 130,000 new health staff in Africa; other countries, such as Canada, are providing much less.”

There is a critical shortage of doctors in sub-Saharan Africa, which has a high prevalence of diseases like HIV/AIDS. Mills and colleagues estimated the monetary cost of educating a doctor through primary, secondary and medical school in nine sub-Saharan countries with significant HIV-prevalence. The research team added the figures together to estimate how much the origin countries paid to train doctors and how much the destination countries saved in employing them.

The results show that governments spend between $21,000 (Uganda) to $59,000 (South Africa) to train doctors. The countries included in the study paid around $2 billion US dollars (USD) to train their doctors only to see them migrate to richer countries, say the authors. They add that the benefit to the UK was around $2.7 billion USD and about $846 million USD for the United States.

Then there were the dreams, the best and the worst part of it all. We were together, healthy, laughing, talking, hugging -- I swear I could even smell her comforting scent. As soon as I felt whole again, happy again… I’d wake up only to realize that she was gone. It was tough, but I embraced those dreams for the moments they gave me with her, for their ability to let me feel her once again. And then there were the nightmares, the ones that made me so upset that I would literally jump out of bed. She was in pain, dying and non-verbal. In those nightmares I relived the last few weeks of her life on repeat. I would bawl and bawl and scream out for her.

Today, I am better. I’m not sure if there was a turning point or if I just made a decision to be happier. Maybe my tear ducts dried out and I couldn't cry anymore. Maybe she kicked my butt back to life so I wouldn’t waste it away. Whatever the reason, I can now honestly say that my pain, no matter the intensity, didn’t last. Of course, her absence pierces my soul and I miss her - no, crave her - presence every day. Mother’s Day will forever suck. It sucked that she wasn’t there on my wedding day. It sucks that she can’t be here to watch my adorable niece and nephew grow up—she would have loved it and been a fabulous grandmother. It really sucks that I can’t ask her about her youth, call her up to gossip or to learn her delicious recipes, or the countless other things that people get to do. I miss her cooking - man, do I miss her cooking! And without a doubt, I would do anything if I could bring her back. But I can’t. So instead I chose to hold on and to cope.

Coping does not mean "moving on" from her passing. It means carrying her forward with me as I move through my life, always with her ever-present guidance and love. It means being comforted in the knowledge and hope that one day we will be reunited. Because with the people you love the most, there is no goodbye. There is only see you later.

Meet the author! (Furreal. She's fantastic!)

Fact of the day indeed. I had a look at the survey (PDF), which isn't hard to do by the way. The article on the Daily Caller had a link to follow so anyone with a sense of curiosity or an interest in the source could find out for themselves.

The survey was conducted from Apr 18-May 22 of this year. Here's the question being made into a fact of the day.

So what's wrong with this question? What "current changes" in the medical system does it refer to? Nobody knows so it's left up to the survey responder to determine that. Someone decided that "Obamacare" was the current change and it magically caused 83% of doctors to consider quitting.

This question is just as bad as it is clever, if it was intended to be. It appears that requiring people to purchase insurance is bad. But what they're asking is if it will improve access to actual medical care. I have insurance but I can only go to doctors who accept my insurance. Consequently my access is limited. However, I can still go to any emergency room just like any uninsured person.

Another question that violates one of the rules of good survey question making which says to write questions so everyone understand them the same way. Ask ten medical professionals what the "current problems" in medicine are and I bet you get ten different answers.

Yet another ambiguous and consequently invalid question. For Doctor A the wrong track of the current path could mean no universal health care. For Doctor B it could be too much government regulation. For Doctor C it could mean the high prices of drugs.

Whoa, not much wiggle room on that question, eh?

Cathy McMorris Rodgers and her fellow Republican House members will vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act--again. Because it's a far more pressing matter than climate change, Wall Street thievery, war, the gradual creation of a police state, cell phone tracking, etc.

This morning I remembered to have a look at my rear tire to check the wear. I didn't want it to get as bad as that one time. Well it wasn't as bad as that time but it didn't have much to go.

So I took this morning's commute nice and easy. No tight turns, hard braking, or speeding. I know I shouldn't have, but after seeing how bad the tire could get that one time I figured

Google may stop calling Android open source, and be done with it. This pseudo-open source stance is a big joke and a slap in the face.

"If a device implementation is already launched on an earlier Android version with full-disk encryption disabled by default, such a device cannot meet the requirement through a system software update and thus MAY be exempted."

Since I've never had a device encrypted by default, let me ask you guys a question about the user experience. My Nexus 5 is encrypted and when I reboot I am asked for a password before the OS actually boots to decrypt everything. No password, no start.

How do these default encrypted devices handle reboots? Does it only require passwords once you've set a screen pin?

Those are managed devices, I assume? That may be a feature of KNOX for Samsung, and it's possible the device admin features for Android already have boot PIN as a flag that can be enabled in the console.

Mgamerz

May be KNOX now, but I know before KNOX was a thing things like the Droid 4 had it. Our users hated it. They still do but now we encrypt laptops too heh.

Ah, I've only ever owned Nexus devices, so I didn't realize it wasn't standard. When you say "an option" do you mean that this is something you can disable in Android on a Nexus or just that it is a thing that it does once encrypted?

No it isn't. It's part of the encryption feature on all 3.0+ devices, and it uses whatever your device's screen lock is, so it doesn't have to necessarily be a PIN.

Tassadar

When devices are encrypted by default, they have password "default_password". They work exactly the same as you are used to on your Nexus 5, except if you don't change the password from the default one, it will enter it automatically during boot - that way you don't see the "enter password" screen during boot unless you changed the lockscreen to pin/gesture/password (encryption and lockscreen are tied together).

Yeah, the encryption by default is useless unless you use pin/gesture/password for the lockscreen. The difference is that when you do use it, you don't have to

Grant Summary
Usher syndrome is a genetic condition causing both hearing loss and vision loss, and is the most common cause of deafblindness in the Western world. Some individuals with Usher syndrome have moderate hearing loss, where others are born totally deaf. With the advent and increasing availability of the cochlear implant, the hearing loss in Usher syndrome can be managed and even, in many cases, cured. The vision loss in Usher syndrome, however, results from retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a progressive disorder of the retina for which there is no known cure or effective treatment. The progressive vision loss resulting from RP is therefore the most disabling aspect of this condition. Finding and delivering effective treatment for RP is the urgent mission of our research.

Accurate monitoring of retinal function in retinitis pigmentosa requires the use of several test methods, including assessment of the visual field and the electroretinogram (ERG). The visual field test quantifies visual field loss, while the ERG measures the electrical impulses of the retina to quantify retinal cell function. Over the last 30 years, the Oregon Retinal Degeneration Center (ORDC), under the direction of Dr. Richard Weleber, has become one of the premier centers in the world for the measurement and standardization of retinal function in RP. As a direct result of Dr. Weleber’s passion and expertise, the ERG has evolved into a highly accurate, sensitive, and reproducible test method. The visual field, however, while extremely informative, has a high degree of test-retest variability. This variability decreases the utility of the visual field test in clinical treatment trials, where accurate, sensitive, and reproducible test measures are vital for monitoring treatment effectiveness. In fact, the lack of acceptable visual field testing for retinal dysfunction is now a limiting factor in initiating clinical trials for RP and Usher syndrome. Dr. Weleber has joined with Dr. Chris Johnson, an internationally known visual field expert with over 20 years of experience in glaucoma research and test development, to refine and develop visual field testing techniques specific to field loss in RP.

This study will assess and optimize computerized visual field test methods for patients with RP by addressing the following three specific aims: to ascertain the test-retest variability of visual field measurements in RP, to spatially characterize visual field losses specific to particular subtypes of RP (including Usher syndrome), and to develop novel testing algorithms that will enable us to move forward with clinical treatment trials. At the conclusion of this study, we will publish our

On the less severe end of the continuum—still abusive and warranting punishment—are affronts that are strictly verbal. Asking repeatedly for sexual encounters for those who have refused; commenting on another person’s relevant body parts, cat calls, and ogling. Each is troubling and can cause a hostile work or social environment. However, while the use of force leaves the victim no choice—verbal communication allows one to respond appropriately—or counter them with a cold shoulder. One can repeat to oneself, “Sticks and stones will break my bones, but words will not hurt me.”

Close to outright coercive behavior is the use of power. Any indication that the offender threatened to deny the victim a promotion, a job, opportunities for stardom or publication—should be treated much more seriously than mere verbal assaults. Some micro-aggression mavens will argue that such a power differential exists in all cross-gender relationships. However, I refer to specific application of power, of the kind listed, not merely that often men have more generalized power than women in our society. Those who cover up, enable or otherwise are directly complicit in deal with sexual violence, should have a much higher level of punishment than they currently face, Church officials for instance.

One may say that elected officials should be held to a higher moral standard then the rest of us because they’re supposed to act as role models. Others point out that many of the most revered public servants—Roosevelt, JFK, Bill Clinton—led rather flawed personal lives. It is not obvious that we can expect people to be both successful politicians and—models of moral appropriateness. None of this is to suggest that the unforgivable laws members of Congress passed to protect themselves from charges of sexual harassment are justified. The three-month window for harassment claims and one month of mandatory counseling must be revoked. Nor should lawmakers be shielded from penalties as they currently are as they use tax payer funds to pay for hush settlements. However, for most offenses, those penalties should not entail setting aside the choice of the electorate. They should be made to apologize, reduced in rank, be isolated, and fined—but not forced out of office. This is the job of the voters. After all, they could initiate a recall drive if they did not wish to wait until the next election.

To be fair, one must also note that norms change. The fact that “everyone does it” and that men were brought up

Grandfathers Rights for Pesticide Users - Changes to Current Rules

A current exemption in UK law, commonly known as “grandfather rights”, allows anyone born before 31 December 1964, to use plant protection products (PPPs) authorised for professional use on their own or their employer’s land, without having to hold a certificate (of competence) although they should still be suitably trained and competent for their job.

The Plant Protection Products (Sustainable Use) Regulations 2012 allowed this exemption to continue until Thursday 26 November 2015. From this date forwards, everyone who uses PPPs authorised for professional use must have a certificate.

In addition, after 26 November 2015, it will be an offence for anyone to purchase PPPs authorised for professional use unless they have ensured that the intended end user has a certificate.

If you don’t personally already have a certificate, or you have employees without certification, you will need to get them trained before the changes occur, but don’t worry, many training companies are running courses up until the week before the changes come into effect.

New Level 2 Certificate in the Safe Use of Pesticides

City and Guilds Land Based Services has developed a new Level 2 Award - Safe Use of Pesticides Replacing Grandfather Rights.

If you were born before 31 December 1964, and will only use pesticides on your own or your employer’s land, you will need to obtain this new qualification.

Alternatively, you can obtain one of the existing Level 2 Safe Use of Pesticide awards appropriate to the work and type of equipment you use. You must take this route if you intend to work as a contractor or apply {PPPs {Plant Protection Products} to land you or your employer do not own.

Further information on the new qualifications

The new qualification will take account of the fact that people working under “grandfather rights” should already have some form of training and may have many years experience in working with pesticides. In recognition of this, the qualification has been developed so as to take significantly less time, and cost less, than the existing Level 2 qualifications for pesticide users.

The training will be based on a workbook, setting out the required knowledge, which can be studied at the candidate’s convenience. This will be followed up with a practical assessment of competence. As with all Level 2 pesticide awards, the training modules will be based on the type of equipment to be used. The assessment should

At least five people suspected not of aiding bin Laden but of helping the CIA spy on the al Qaida chief's compound were arrested more recently. These include a retired army officer widely reported as neighbor Maj. Amir Aziz, whose house with two watchtowers would be an ideal place from which to observe the bin Laden compound. He, however, told McClatchy that he'd never been detained.

Coming reluctantly to the gate of his house to speak to a journalist, Aziz said he'd retired from the army.

"It's not me," he said, referring to news reports of an arrested army major, before shutting the gate.

A local police officer who'd arrived at the raid scene early, before Pakistani military units responded to it, is still in custody from the initial arrests.

The contractors who built the house, brothers Noor Muhammad and Gul Mada Khan, were arrested, then released and now have disappeared; it isn't known whether they were detained once more or they've simply fled Abbottabad.

A local man, Atta-ur-Rahman, known as Lala, who'd chopped down trees next to the bin Laden compound in the days before the U.S. raid, was arrested but has since been released. It had been suspected that he'd cut down the trees to clear the area for the American helicopters to land.

Wazir Dill, a doctor who'd treated children from the bin Laden house at his Abbottabad clinic, and a health worker, Bakht Jan, who'd visited the house to offer vaccinations for the children (she wasn't let in), were among those arrested and then set free.

The police also have released Shamraiz, who lived opposite the compound and worked there as an occasional gardener, but he declined to be interviewed.

Fahad Ali and Abbas Ali, Abbottabad residents taken in for their association with a religious organization, have been freed. So has Tahir Javed, who lived close to the compound and went over to help put out the fire that broke out during the raid May 2 by U.S. Navy SEALs.

An auto mechanic, Muhammad Babar, who used to repair the two vehicles at compound, was detained but has since been released.

A porter at the Ayub Medical Complex hospital in Abbottabad, Samar Shehzad, who was suspected of working as a driver for the bin Laden household,

The crime spree began sometime Sunday or Monday, and initially came to the attention of Brewer police officers by a complaint about attempted break-ins at residences on Elm Street on Monday morning.

“We had a report Monday of two male individuals operating an orange-red pickup on lower Elm Street,” said Martin. “They had apparently gone to several residences and were knocking on doors, saying they were looking for jumper cables.

“They went to one residence and went inside, where they were confronted by the owners. They told the owners they were looking for a lost dog and then left the area in the pickup.”

At 5 a.m. Tuesday, Penobscot County Sheriff’s Office responded after a passerby reported two males doing doughnuts in the parking lot of the South Levant Baptist Church on Horseback Road in Levant.

“Prior to that, the owners of an orange Nissan pickup called to report their truck had been stolen from their driveway off the Irish Road in Carmel,” said Sgt. Roy Peary of the Penobscot County Sheriff’s Office. “They saw their vehicle being driven out of the driveway.”

Deputy James Kennedy and Maine State Trooper Michael Johnson both responded, along with a K-9 unit, and found the abandoned truck in the church parking lot. Deputy Kennedy found two males standing in Horseback Road near a gravel lane and stopped to question them.

“The older male admitted to one of the deputies that he was involved in the actual taking of the vehicle, and they were both charged with unauthorized use of property,” said Peary.

It was unclear from the police report why neither man was taken into custody.

In the meantime, Brewer police were investigating the attempted break-in cases, and found information that led them to the Brewer Armory on Elm Street.

“That’s where we determined the pickup was stolen from, and another stolen vehicle from Pittsfield was abandoned there,” Martin said. “We also discovered multiple burglaries to several motor vehicles parked at the armory and owned by military service people on deployment.”

Martin said the car theft victims were members of the U.S. Army National Guard training out of state, and were unavailable to talk to police. Martin said at least five, and likely more, vehicles were burglarized.

“What we have to do is check what is missing and what’s been stolen once the

Stella Bowles was a Grade 6 Nova Scotia student when she turned environmental activist to campaign against sewage pipes draining straight into the LaHave River. This is the inspirational first person account of Stella's Grade 6 science fair project which caught the eyes of the media, the public and government leaders propelling her into the limelight.

Stella details her two and a half year fight to clean up the river, winning numerous awards for her environmental activism along the way. She succeeds in shaming three levels of government and rallying supporters into funding a $15.7 million cleanup. Today, she continues to campaign for cleaner water and demonstrates to other children how to test water quality in their own backyards, and how to take action if they find their water is polluted too.

Stella's story will motivate readers to engage in local environmental activism. She demonstrates that doing what's right has no age barriers.

Love it or hate it, PowerPoint is everywhere. “Preparing a presentation” has become synonymous to “preparing a PowerPoint presentation,” but is this really a good attitude when it comes to communicating research? PowerPoint is a tool, and as with any tool, its true power comes not from the tool itself but from the one who holds it. Like dynamite, handled properly it can blast through the mountain that is communication between presenter and audience, but placed in the wrong hands and the audience may end up buried in the rubble.

I recently attended a great talk on the subject, which has got me thinking about presentations. What are the dangers of PowerPoint, how can we avoid them, and how can we make sure to keep focus on the content rather than the medium?

Identify your audience

Know your audience. Without them, there is no presentation. When presenting to a group of experts in your field, skip over the in-depth intro and focus most of your slides on the knitty-gritty details; when presenting to a group of first-year chemistry students, do the opposite. But it’s not always this easy. What about mixed audiences? For example, I gave a short talk last month to a group of graduate students in materials science, which is so broad a field that many were not at all familiar with my subject. On the one hand, I wanted everyone in the audience to be able to understand my work; on the other hand, one of the goals of the series of talks was to find solutions to research problems we might be having, so it was important to present the details of my research. With only 10 minutes to talk, I couldn’t do both, so I had to identify who in the audience I wanted to present to. In this case, I decided that if I wanted tips from those in my field, I would have to present my results in detail, so I prepared a presentation with a brief introduction and focused more on my results. Many conferences are multidisciplinary, so choosing who in the audience you want to direct your talk to is an important first step in preparing a presentation.

A presentation is not a paper

Depression diagnosed

The use of depression medication in the treatment of mental illness is at an all-time high.

There is no reason to believe it will decline in the foreseeable future either. Depression diagnosed with increased frequency and antidepressants are the most popular means of treating the disorder. Antidepressants are extremely popularly. There are those, however, who are against using depression medication.

Some argue that the research support the effectiveness of the pharmaceuticals is over influenced by the financial interests of large pharmaceutical companies. They maintain that any statement of depression medication effectiveness should be disregarded because of the corrupt nature of the medical industry. Some may temper that perspective, arguing instead that the effectiveness of the pills is heavily overstated and over prescribed.

There are strong arguments to be made that the medical-governmental-industrial complex tends to be self-perpetuating and may not always have the greater good at the forefront. However, the wholesale rejection of available evidence based on bias is not particularly compelling to most analysts.

Even those who think less conspiratorially may oppose the use of depression medication. One common argument raised by objectors is that the medicines do not get at the root of the disease and instead act merely to mask its symptoms. They may state that it will be more difficult curing the disease and eliminating its triggers by masking the effects. They recommend therapy-based treatment programs to get to “the heart of the problem” instead of treating the issue with medication.

Others maintain that depression medication is simply too mysterious to be embraced. They argue that no one truly understands why the medications work and that, thus, there is reason to be concerned about what they may be doing to the mind of the patient. It is true that no one truly understands exactly why all antidepressants tend to produce the results they do. However, scientific research is beginning to reach more solid conclusions, which may render this objection outdated, in the near future.

Others opposed to the use of antidepressants base their arguments on religious beliefs or assessments of the severity of potential side effects associated with the use of drugs.

Critics of antidepressants offer alternative means of treatment. They often support aggressive therapy-based solutions, the use of improved nutrition and other acts in order to fight off the symptoms of a depressive disorder. Many advocate non-traditional treatment methods or more ancient practices designed to improve mental health.

Despite a large chorus of detractors, however, the use of antidepressants continues unabated. The best available

I really dont like the idea of Respect worming thier way into the Council, when they were so clearly and comprehesively thrashed in the May elections. Abjol Miah needs to respect the view of the people of Tower Hamlets and move on with his life.

Respects statement today reinforces the argument that your blogs and indeed Andrew Gilligans blogs do have truth to them. I really hope the Labour party NEC now finally realise just exactly what they have accelerated here in Tower Hamlets. The very Respect party that claims to have campaigned for a directly electd mayor was simply a front for Lutfur Rahmans Labour party which has always consisted of support from Respect activists. This pact between Lutfur Rahmans Labour group and Respect did not just happen today, it has been on-going for months. Labour candidates at several wards were targeted by Respect candidates with support from pro-Lutfur activists in a bid to oust them to ensure that Lutfur Rahman remains leader but that failed due to the unexpected surge of Labour turnout on May 6th. Just take former Labour councillors Fazlul Haque and Salim Ullah as an example?

It continued throughout the process to select a mayoral candidate for Labour where hoardes of Respect candidates and activists were helping Lutfur Rahman win his campaign. They were also at Lutfur Rahmans Launch party at the Troxy. We have to now understand that Tower Hamlets council has been infiltrated and taken over by IFE members and sadly in time, the Bangladeshi Muslim community will be branded just like the BNP – only this time, it will not just be the 13 BNP councillors in Barking and Dagenham that get ousted, it wil be the 41 Labour councillors in Tower Hamlets that will fall victim to this very dangerous scenario.


TB, yeah, I guess some may say that is misleading, I don't. Arians offense was better than Haley's in the post-season.

8 games with Arians they still, discounting the 4 TD returns, scored 22 TDs and only 12 FGs.

7 games with Haley and those numbers were 15 TDs and 18 FGs, before that offensive explosion against Jax, those numbers were 9 TDs and 18 FGs in 6 games.

The Jets game, yeah, we had a TD return by the defense to make it 24-0, but the real point is that we were already up 17-0, we got out to a big lead which is what you want your offense to do and it made the other team press, forced to try and play catch up. Never mind that the great Dick LeBeau defense would surrender 19 points in pretty much the last 15 minutes of the game to make it close.

Arians offenses were able to get out to those leads, 10-0 against Arizona in the Super Bowl, 17-0 against the JETS, the SD game was even at 7-7 but then the offense got that big lead scored 3 TDs in short order and we were up 28-10, against Baltimore we got up 13-0. Contrast that with Haley's offenses. Wow, there we were up 3-0 against Baltimore! And against Cincy we were up 3-0, then it was up 6-0, then 9-0, impressive!!! Against Denver our biggest lead was when we went up on them by 4 points 10-6 and then later 13-9, we would lose 23-16. Miami, now that was a game in which Haley's offense played like Arians units, we quickly got up on them by 14 points, 14-0, and not by coincidence we won the game 30-12. KC the FG game, less said about that the better. NE game? No lead. Jax game? No lead.

Sorry, but I still contend that Arians offenses were better in the post season. We were even more balanced and were able to run for TDs, having 12 rushing TDs compared to Haley's offenses only accounting for 5 rushing TDs.

I am glad that Haley is gone and hopefully Fitchner can be the OC to truly make this offense play to its potential. One thing that we have to get back to however

Wordmarks/numerals: The font is derived from a font you have already seen from Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Pepsi (late 1980s) and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993-99). (That font definitely enhances the future-minded look I wanted to capture). I added some blocky serifs to it to give it a "Texas accent," and it may even remind you of the "HOUSTON" wordmark that the Astros once used on their road jerseys (1965-74). The wordmarks on the home and road jerseys swoop upwards--kind of like the Planet Hollywood logo or the logo the Seattle Sonics used in the 1990s--to match the upwards-shooting star and enhance that "onward and upward" spirit.

The proof is in the piping: You knew that the "tip of the cap" to the "tequila sunrise" jerseys had to come in somewhere. I never considered using the 1975 "tequila sunrise" design as a base for my design; still, those orange-and-yellow stripes are a part of Astros' history and I wanted to incorporate them some way. So after much deliberation, I decided to give that tribute in the form of piping--namely, three-striped piping (similar to the blue-red-blue piping you see on the Atlanta Braves' jerseys) made from the Astros' new colors: Navy blue, bronze and gold.

But wait, Mark, did you say "bronze and gold"? I didn't want to use orange and yellow; not when their metallic equivalents are available here in the 21st century. Bronze and gold go so well with navy blue and they shine like the stars (OK, maybe that last part sounded corny). Besides, metals are tough and yellow is a color you often find on bruises. The upwards-shooting star is also bronze and gold to add to that aforementioned "tequila sunrise" tribute.

So there you have it. I'd love to see these unis become solid reality next year, but as I said, it's not an official contest. For all I know, the Astros may have already shelled out mucho dinero for some sports marketing firm to come out with turkeys like the ones they brought out 12 years ago. I wonder why sports franchises even bother. The Uni-Watch community is so much

His red RAV4 overhangs a curb near Dewbourne Ave. and Bathurst St., hazards flashing. Construction workers eye him with suspicion.

“It’s easier to ask for forgiveness than it is for permission,” the forty-something artist will explain later from his cluttered basement studio in Swansea Village.

Molina’s not posting a missing cat flyer or an ad for junk removal, typically seen on these city poles. Instead, it’s a small 6”x6” canvas painting of the nearby sidewalk.

This is Molina’s 79th such painting. It’s part of what the artist has dubbed “The 416 Project.” He plans to paint and post 416 canvases to utility poles in 35 neighbourhoods throughout the 416 area code.

Article Continued Below

“I’m using each neighbourhood — and the whole city — as my gallery,” says the artist-actor-filmmaker.

While city bylaws don’t allow for public art on utility poles, Molina has yet to face a fine and he hasn’t been told to stop. His wife, Elaine Mah, usually keeps watch in case parking enforcement “scoots us along,” she says.

The couple shares a Swansea home with their two Lhasa Apso-mixed rescue dogs, Farley and Gus, who gnaw at each other and circle around Molina’s paint-smeared Crocs as he works in his small basement studio. He wears clean green Crocs elsewhere in their home, the navy pair are reserved for the studio.

Dozens of acrylic paint markers litter his work space and hundreds of unopened canvases sit in boxes against one wall. The paintings — photographs transferred to canvas and brought to life with paint markers — depict mundane details of urban life in vibrant colours. One looks skyward at leafless tree branches and telephone wires. Another shows a bright yellow fire hydrant against a dull brown lawn.

Each piece Molina creates starts with an iPhone photo, which is brushed onto the canvas and then detailed by Molina. He says he wants Torontonians to see their city from a new perspective. (Todd Korol)

It’s a bit on the nose, but that’s the ultimate point. History is important, and we are all the sum of what came before. It’s an admirable thought, but it doesn’t make for gripping fiction without a strong narrative to lead us there.

No one was more surprised by my enjoyment of Claire Evans’ The Fourteenth Letter than me. It looked like the kind of book I would enjoy as a fun distraction, but nothing more. And I was sorely in need of a fun distraction.

The Fourteenth Letter opens with a grisly murder. What follows is an historical mystery with a classical twist, blending old world British Gothic with new world American ingenuity. It was a book about madness, privilege and eugenics, and while it didn’t keep me guessing through the whole reading experience, it definitely swept me along for the ride.

I was impressed with Evans’ characterisation. Her characters were deeply flawed, mysterious, but personable. Their experiences created a sense of real personal growth. The William Lamb of the end of the novel was virtually unrecognisable from the character we’d met at the beginning, but his growth and development were so natural that it really gave his character depth. Savannah Shelton, the American gunslinger as well, was introduced as a rough and hardened criminal. Even she proved to have real depth, while Evans’ masterfully omitted the details of her erstwhile crimes, leaving the reader to judge the character on her personality and deeds through the novel rather than her sordid past. The remaining heroes were appropriately heroic, with the generic good-guy police constable who served to move the plot at an even pace, and the villains were appropriately dark and menacing.

The pace, plotting and characterisation, however, were belied by The Fourteenth Letter’s title and branding. The cover is more evocative of a feminine gothic family saga/romance. There was nothing that screamed historical murder mystery. The titular ‘Fourteenth Letter’ as well, was introduced far too late in the plot for it to have any real impact or meaning. This was the book’s biggest letdown. The big reveal was hardly a reveal at all, as I hadn’t even known in was an option up until that point.

All in all The Fourteenth Letter was a strong entry into the historical crime genre. It was a fun read that was equal parts cliché and original

Colorado is home to many 14,000-foot peaks. Part of the excitement of driving off-road in this region is the ability to take your 4x4 over high passes. While at the FJ Summit, we drove over Imogene Pass, the second highest in Colorado. There are six different passes one can drive over at FJ Summit, each one with an exhilarating crawl to the top.

Most of the trails at FJ Summit can be done in a stock 4WD. Having better off-road tires will make traction and sidewall protection better on these dirt and rock trails. There is one trail that does require a higher degree of vehicle modification--Poughkeepsie Gulch. Lifted suspension, 33+ inch tires along with a rear locker and sliders are recommended. On wet and slippery days, a winch may also come in handy when going up “the wall.” This trail is popular with the daredevils, as the risk of vehicle damage does exist.

FRIENDSThe FJ Summit offered a great opportunity to meet other Toyota 4WD enthusiasts and off-road forum regulars from IH8MUD and our sister site FJCruiserForums.com (http://www.fjcruiserforums.com/). It was nice putting a name to a face.

You might show up by yourself at FJ Summit, but by the time you leave you will have made new friends. The environment lends itself to forging new friendships with other people that also enjoy exploring the outdoors in the 4x4s.

With a dinner almost every night at FJ Summit HQ, and different parties around town, there’s no reason not to mingle on and off the trail.

On “Night in Ouray,” the entire town was buzzing with FJ Summit participants exploring the local eateries and watering holes. We stopped at the Western Hotel where a large group of Summiteers gathered for a “presentation.” Cool frosty beer and soda was served in collector Metal Tech pint glasses.

FAMILY

We can’t forget the family. The FJ Summit is very family friendly. We met other adventure parents that also brought their little tikes on the trail. The FJ Summit does offer some trail rides that allow for more stops, which are a blessing when you’re trying to juggle kids, bottles, cameras and diapers.

The program's interface isn't awful, but it definitely lacks polish. We Canon C5035 Printer Driver ourselves relying heavily on the tool tips to figure out what the buttons in the toolbar did. Although some of the buttons' icons will look familiar to users of other image-editing programs, many were puzzling. We were annoyed that some buttons were located off to the right of the screen, needlessly separated from the rest of the program's functions. As for features, we understand that Canon C5035 Printer Driver is a specialized program meant to help users clip certain elements from images; therefore we cannot fault it for being short on features. What we can fault it for is that the program does not perform this specialized function any better than other image-editing software we've used. The program does contain other basic image-editing features, which work fine, but there's nothing exceptional here. Although the program generally ran without issues, it did crash at one point during testing. The program's built-in Help file does an adequate job of explaining the program's features.

Just as I was about to jump into the shower the other morning, Muddy Madam shouted that she thought someone had just driven into Deux Smurf.

As quickly as I could, I threw on some clothes and rushed outside to watch as a neighbour was busily wiping a huge black mark off the Deux Smurfs front bumper. What had happened was, she had reversed all the way down the Cul-De-Sac opposite Muddy Towers, reversed around the corner and into Deux Smurf's off-side front bumper with her near-side rear light cluster. No, I wasn’t pleased, but I didn’t go borderline crazy at her either, not because she had caused more damage to her Fiat 500L than she had to Deux Smurf, but because she didn’t do it on purpose, and she wasn’t half panicking.

On first impression it appeared that all she’d done was scuff the bumper, but a closer inspection revealed that she has also pushed it in a good 2”. At first it didn’t seem much of a problem, but on the way to work that morning the tyre would grind on the bumper extension when turning left, this needed to be sorted.

A quick detour after work to a mechanic I’ve known for around 30 years, Steve Wilson in Bolton, confirmed that to straighten the bumper he would need to remove the wheel, inner arch and other bits to push it back into place. £70 tops Steve reckoned, so I arranged to drop her off the following week.

According to Steve it was an awkward job and not one which he originally though he could fix, so he ended up taking Deux Smurf elsewhere.

A day or 2 later than expected and she was back outside Muddy Towers, and after a scrub with Muc-Off's Bug & Tar remover I got rid of the Fiat’s black bumper mark and Deux Smurf's bumper was as good as new again.

On the subject of bumpers, this little incident reminded me of the time I was in Sainsbury’s car park a few years ago when a Metro taxi reversed into my old ’96 Discovery. Oddly, he hit the off-side corner of the bumper too with his tailgate, but unlike Deux Smurf it wasn't structural and an easy 30

But others defended both the Demand model, which employs a vast network of low-paid freelancers to crank out simple reference articles, and the content itself. Commenter richardmorgan2011 semi-praised one of the stories I'd singled out for mockery:

The article on push buttons** would be fine for someone who actually needed to know about digital flush buttons. Granted, I don’t know why that would be necessary, but if I understand the way that Demand Media operates, there have been quite a few queries on search engines about types of push buttons and the information provided would definitely have answered my question.

My bubble of scornful superiority punctured, I circled back to re-read that article and noticed that it does indeed contain some detailed and sophisticated information -- surprisingly sophisticated, in fact, for an entry that's otherwise so inane. Suspiciously sophisticated, you might even say.
So I took one of the more sophisticated passages -- "In industrial and commercial applications, push buttons can be linked together by a mechanical linkage so that the act of pushing one button causes the other button to be released" -- and plugged it into Google.

As you probably guessed by now, that entire paragraph -- and most of the entry in question, in fact -- was plagiarized. From the Wikipedia entry for "Push-Button." (I checked an old revision of the article to be sure that the plagiarism didn't go in the other direction.)

To recap: I selected seven eHow articles, looking not for evidence of plagiarism but merely for silliness. One of them turned out to contain plagiarized material. (Incidentally, two others were evidently so embarrassing to the company that they've since been removed from the site.) Is it sheer dumb luck that I stumbled on the one-in-1,000 Demand story that happens to be ripped off? That seems unlikely.

I contacted Demand's PR department to ask what stops they take to prevent plagiarism. A spokesman couldn't comment, since the company's in the midst of its SEC-mandated quiet period*, but he did direct me to Demand's contributors' agreement, its ethics policy, and twoposts meant to help contributors understand plagiarism. According to CJR, Demand also uses software from a firm called iThenticate to screen out pilfered language: "Demand has even integrated iThenticate into its content management

THE CORN SNAKE: APPEARANCE, BIOLOGY, LIFE CYCLE, HABITAT, DIET, BEHAVIOR
The Corn snakes (scientifically known as Pantherophis guttatus) are special species that are mostly found in the North America, Southeastern America and the United States. Their attractive and calm nature makes them very popular and loved by many people. It is important to know that corn snakes are harmless, but they are often times mistaken as venomous copperhead and then got killed as a result. They have these characteristics of simplicity, as they are reluctant to bite, calm, and have very attractive looks. These attributes make corn snake beneficial to humans. Below you will find more information about this wonderful snake specie.

Appearance
The corn snakes are type of species that are unique in nature, they appear in different colors, and have a very attractive body better than the copperhead snakes. The adult snake measures from 61 to 182 centimeter in length and have brighter color, slender in look, and a humble nature. These attributes distinguished them from the normal copperhead snakes.

Biology
Corn snake belong to the class of Reptilia Chordata and are easy to breed. When it is time reproduce, they are normally put through a cooling period that can take 60 up to 90 days long. They tend to lay eggs in places with low sunlight and where they cannot be disturbed, and they usually breed immediately after the winter.

Behavior
Corn snakes have amazing striking behavior that makes them suitable to keep in captivity as pets. They have this soft nature, calm temperament, and tolerant behavior that makes them easy to be taking care of. Most corn snakes enjoy burrowing and hiding, and this also make them accommodated in areas where will not be disturbed. Their subtle nature makes them mostly fed on pre-killed prey and those injured heavily.

Habitat
Generally, Corn snakes prefer to live in overgrown fields, on tress, and forest. They are also sighted on places such as Flatwoods, abandoned buildings, and farmlands. Many a times, the adults tend to live above the ground level and can go as high as 6000 feet. However, seasons can also determine where they live. For example, they tend to hibernate during winter and they tend to shelter in rocks in most temperate climates. They hunt less during the winter, because all they care for is to feel the heat of the sun

All were believed by health officials to have contracted an infection from the amoeba from swimming in warm, freshwater lakes, rivers or natural springs. See timeline of the sudden deaths »

There is no risk from properly chlorinated swimming pools, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The amoeba enters the human body through the nose. It then travels to the brain, where it begins to feed.

Symptoms of the amoeba's rampage begin 1 to 14 days after infection and resemble the flu. At the onset of those symptoms the amoeba victim's health swiftly declines. Watch how to reduce risk of contracting the amoeba »

At this point, says Dr. Kevin Sherin of the Orange County Health Department who is investigating three deaths this summer in Florida, "It's progressing very rapidly and then there's a downhill course for them there. Folks lapse into a coma, there are abnormal movements of the eyes and a terrible cascade of events leading to the actual death of parts of the brain."

Although exposure to the amoeba is usually fatal, Sherin says a cocktail of drugs can fight the amoeba if administered in time. The key, he says, is identifying the amoeba early.

Khan announced after the court’s decision that his protest would be postponed. He instead called on his supporters to join a “thanksgiving” rally at Islamabad’s Parade Ground on Wednesday.

“I thank all those who fought this 20-year-long war against corruption with me,” he told the media. He also accused Sharif of “hurting Pakistan’s development through corruption”.

A five-judge bench of the Supreme Court adjourned the hearing of five petitions seeking a probe into the Panama Papers leaks till Wednesday. The proposed commission will report to the court, which will also choose its members and chairman.

“We have to save the country from unrest and crises,” Jamali said, adding the Panama Papers leaks had affected the entire country. The court said it would resolve the issue and all parties would be given an opportunity to present their views.

Khan’s planned lockdown of Islamabad and clashes between PTI supporters and law enforcement personnel over the past few days had sparked fears of a confrontation between the government and the opposition party.

Some observers had suggested that the powerful army could intervene in the event of a breakdown of law and order. Relations between the civilian government and the military are at a low after the army described the leak of information about a crucial meeting on countering terrorism to the Dawn newspaper as a breach of national security.

Sharif has been under pressure from opposition parties to order a probe into revelations in leaked documents from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca that his three children – Hassan Nawaz, Hussain Nawaz, Maryam Nawaz – owned offshore assets worth millions of dollars. The Sharif family has said the assets were acquired through legitimate business interests.

Defence minister Khawaja Asif, a senior leader of the PML-N, said his party had accepted the Supreme Court’s decision. “In the present situation, it is crucial for all parties to show faith in the Supreme Court,” he said.

“Now the judiciary has taken up the matter, there is no logic in agitation on the streets. Both the accused and accuser are standing before the court, so I think the nation should be given relief from the agony of this protest,” Asif told reporters. -ht

New sites help artists show different side

Not long ago, radio and television were the prime targets of a band’s album promo circuit. Things have changed drastically in recent years, with the Web serving as a leading platform for musicians whose fans have grown accustomed to accessing video footage of their favorite artists online, on demand and for free.

One popular online destination that labels and artists have been turning to since 2005 is Pepsi Music. Formerly known as Pepsi Smash, this long-running partnership between Yahoo Music and the Fortune 500 soft-drink manufacturer features exclusive live performances from top recording artists, and mixes things up by providing a plethora of unique content. “We’re not just capturing exclusive content, we’re creating our own,” says Neal Weiss, executive producer of Yahoo Originals. “When we started as a company dreaming bigger, this was the outgrowth of what a full video experience could look like on the Web.” To date, Pepsi Music has featured more than 300 artists in 500 music segments and has generated upward of 650 million video streams. It is one of Yahoo’s longest-running music programs and one of the most successful corporate partnerships in the Internet company’s history.

In addition to showcasing artists like Rihanna, Green Day, Maroon 5 and Mary J. Blige belting out their own tunes, Pepsi Music boasts original shows including “Mic Pass,” in which rappers such as Raekwon and Jadakiss improvise a few bars of a tune before “passing the mic” onto another rapper. There’s also “On Location,” which sends such talents as Jordin Sparks and Jay Sean to unusual settings (think diners, grocery stores and Central Park), surprising unsuspecting onlookers in the process.

Then there’s “Cover Art,” which features musicians performing songs written by other artists they admire. The show has generated millions of views and has aided artists’ eternal quest to reach a broader fanbase. For example, Mandy Moore’s cover of Rihanna’s “Umbrella” ended up being reposted on numerous blogs, and All-American Rejects’ acoustic, accordion-enhanced version of Britney Spears’ “Womanizer” blew up virally on fan sites and YouTube.

Ken Bunt, Hollywood Records’ senior VP marketing, says he regularly encourages his artists to appear on Pepsi Music programs for several

Friday night may have featured overcast skies and rain showers but the gloomy weather did not dampen the atmosphere at the Bradbury Science Museum, which was set aglow by two new, innovative exhibits.

The displays touch on hot topics in the science world: alternative energy and nanotechnology. Therefore, the museum extended its hours Friday and invited the public to the grand opening of these exhibits.

Attendees were first introduced to the exhibit, “Algae to Biofuels: Squeezing Power from Pond Scum,” which highlights the work being done at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), New Mexico Consortium (NMC), the University of New Mexico and New Mexico State University.

Dr. Jose Olivares, division leader of LANL’s bioscience division, along with Dr. Richard Sayre of LANL and NMC, conceived the algae biofuel exhibit. Olivares explained that there is a real need to find alternative energy sources. He added, “Bio-energy from bio-mass can be ones of those sources.”

Algae, according to a press release, is set to eclipse all other biofuel energy sources because it is the cheapest, easiest and most environmentally-friendly way to produce liquid fuel.

“Nanotechnology-The Science of the Small” was also presented to attendees. It focuses on the work by LANL’s Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies (CINT).

David Morris, director of CINT, said nanotechnology is fairly new, adding that “nanoscience and nanotechnology is incredibly broad. Everyone from chemists to engineers contributes to nanoscience."

The exhibit touches on “some of the very specific challenges working at a nano scale. It takes specific tools to handle these things; it take specific techniques to work with these things,” Morris said.

Excitement for this science is also visible in the exhibit. “It’s a very exciting time,” he said.

The enthusiasm was contagious; several members of public commented on the new exhibits.“I’m a biologist so I’

So is this to say that open source software is bad? Not at all. Its usage just requires that the enterprise architect and the systems manager understand the risks, the resources, and the timelines required to fix security problems before they result in a breach. It requires steadfast management of your technology stack. It really requires complete understanding of the software comprising the systems you run.

I was flipping through my social media accounts this morning and the theme of the day appears to be “innovation” and “transformation”. They were used in articles in contrast like maybe they were similar but different. I looked up the definitions of both terms in the dictionary.

Innovation (noun) – something newly introduced; such as a method or device.

Transformation (noun) – a marked change, as in appearance or character, usually for the better:

Granted, I picked the definitions but I used those that didn’t describe either term recursively. Here’s what I get: an Innovation is a new thing and a Transformation is a changed thing. So I guess they’re not really similar but they certainly are different. But they still might be related.

So what’s this got to do with Enterprise Architecture? I think it’s this…

Your future state is your innovation. You aim to create something new. Most enterprise architects are satisfied with this and set out to build this new thing.

Unfortunately, if you have an existing business, your starting point is not your blank canvass or empty project file. You need to start with where you are now. That’s your current state. The plan that gets you from your starting point to your end point or from the current state to the future state is that which generates that marked change. It’s a transformation.

You must completely understand your current state in order to build that transformational plan. That’s business-driven enterprise architecture. That’s complete understanding.

Back in December 2013, I started a series of posts that describe processes and how to manage them. You can read them here, here, here, here, and here. Go ahead, we’ll wait.

OK, you’re back!

I have had some time to ruminate and use this processing model. It seems to breed some confusion in my business partners when I discuss it with them. The problem is my use of “Factory” to describe a core process. It

Rebuilding your desktop is an OS 9 trick... I thought that you were having problems in 9, and not X...

You should check to make sure that someone hasn't stuck an amusing little Apple script in your start-up folder. Apple scripts are an easy way to make someones life miserable...

If the trojan had infected OS 9, you had bset make sure that everything in X is the way ou left it, anyone that has access to MacOS 9 can do what ever they want to the disk, as there isn't permissions. So with a text editor someone could do a lot of damage. Just look through the Library/ folders in you Home directory, the root directory, and in the system directory to make sure that there isn't something that looks funny...
Oh and an easier thing to check is to go into the Login Items Control Panel and make sure nothing funky has appeared.

Just be carefull, things don't exactly like to be played with in there...

You could check to make sure that no new users have been added, but it is difficult to create a new user for X from 9, I mean, it has to be possible, but I wouldn't know how to do it, places to look are in the /etc and NetInfo, but again, these aren't safe places to go randomly deleting stuff.

Investing in a Virus Scanner for OS X would be a good move to make, you'll probably end up regretting not having one eventually..., I'm starting to get nervous since I haven't had the money to purchase one yet, either. But, I am planning on burning my home folder to disk

Council Passes Bill To Increase City Contracts For Minority Businesses

NEW YORK — Londel Davis' Harlem-based company has contracts to service fire extinguishers with some of the city's largest agencies, including the Department of Education.

But in spite of his success, Davis, who is black, says it's far more common for him and other minority business owners to get rejected when they bid for city contracts. And he says he doesn't really know why that is.

"It might have been our bid was too low," he said. "We might not have had a piece of a document."

The City Council approved a bill yesterday that would revise Local Law 129, passed in 2005, which was supposed to increase opportunities for minority and women-owned businesses to get contracts from the city. Among other enhancements, the new bill would add a greater level of accountability and eliminate a $1 million contract cap.

Local Law 129 had set targets for city agencies to contract minority and women-owned businesses for certain sectors, including construction, architectural and engineering, as well as services and goods.

But the law had been criticized for failing to do its job because of its lack of enforcement and effectiveness. There were also complaints that, because of the $1 million cap, only 15 percent of the billions of dollars worth of city contracts had been subject to the law.

An analysis of the program under Local Law 129 by the mayor's Office of Contract Services this year found that "disparities still exist" between the number of minority and women-owned business enterprises and "the extent to which they are performing city contracting work."

In announcing yesterday that the Council would pass Intro 911, the update to Local Law 129, Speaker Christine Quinn said in remarks to the press: "It really became clear, crystal clear, that we needed to do more to ensure that [minority and women-owned business enterprises] got their fair share in the city procurement process."

Michael Bloomberg praised the decision by the Council, strongly suggesting he would sign it into law. "These measures are an important part of diversifying our economy," he said.

Not everyone has been enthusiastic about Intro 911. Some Hispanic business groups were disappointed that it lowers procurement goals for Hispanic-owned construction companies from 9 percent to 4 percent, the Village Voice has reported.

"We're very disappointed with this decision," Frank Garcia, chairman of the New York State Coalition of Hispanic Chambers

Cardiff v Huddersfield Championship Preview, 21st August 7.45pm

With two losses in three games of the Championship down, Cardiff are having their struggles adapting to life back in the second tier. Can they secure three points at home against the Terriers, who were up in the Premier League with them last season? Huddersfield so far, have fared even worse than the Bluebirds have following relegation. Read our Cardiff v Huddersfield betting tips for more.

Cardiff News and Form

There have been plenty of goals flying around in Cardiff’s games so far this season. They are W1 L2 for the season with the two defeats happening out on the road at Wigan and Reading, conceding exactly three goals in both of those losses. Cardiff did win their only home game played so far, taking a 2-1 success over Luton, who won the League One title last season. So it’s not been plain sailing for Neil Warnock’s men. With all of their league games having gone over 2.5 goals so far, that’s worth a look for this one. That is a worrying amount of goals that they have conceded so far.

Cardiff v Huddersfield Head to Head

Cardiff and Huddersfield played out two 0-0 draws in the EPL last season
The Bluebirds are unbeaten in 11 games in all competitions against the Terriers
Both teams have scored in two of the last seven meetings
Huddersfield are winless in seven visits to Cardiff

Huddersfield News and Form

The Terriers have only managed one point from their three games back in the Championship. They sacked Jan Siewert over the weekend following a loss at home against Fulham. He won one of his 19 games in charge of the Terriers. Their only point of the campaign happened in a 1-1 draw at QPR, which at least may give them some optimism here.

Like Cardiff, they have not

I found a few videos on YouTube I felt appropriate for what is going on around us. First is; Should I Stay or Should I Go? Many people struggle with the decision of leaving to preserve benefits taken by the mayor. The second video sums up the feelings of many in this; Health Insurance video. This last video is being played for the mayor by over 100 of our finest officers who are leaving a job they love. I hope the mayor likes Johnny Paycheck; he is going to be hearing a lot of him over the next 50 days.

The satirical humor is getting brutal around Headquarters. There is a group retiring who have begun calling themselves, "Gerry's Unenthusiastic Kid's" ; then there is a group who have taken on, "Kicked to the Curb Club" ; or the group calling themselves, "Gerry's Other Casualties" . There were others but I will stick to my pledge to keep the profanity out of my writings. The numbers are growing daily. I predict when the dust settles and the summer begins in full swing (July 1) the San Diego Police Department will have lost 140 of our most experienced, dedicated, professional; managers, supervisors, investigators, and officers.

I found it interesting today to see one of the City Council members pontificating on about "all those retiring are getting 'bonuses' from the City" when they sell or convert their annual leave upon retirement. I could not control my initial thoughts. This guy is a true idiot!!! Selling back earned annual leave is a "BONUS" to this maroon. My guess is the mayor's minions did not factor in (or did not share with council) the amount of money the city would be required to shell out when the most senior of employees left city service. Think of the numbers for a minute. Let's assume the average person with 30 year's service is holding 500 hours of annual leave. Multiply the 500 by the salary of the employee; let's use a Sergeant's base of $43.00 an hour (I'm picking a number for argument sake); the city is shelling out $21,500 for this ONE employee. Now for the San Diego Police Department we are looking at 140 sworn members leaving and taking an average of this $21,500 for a grand total of $3,010,000. That's right folks, three million dollars.

Next up was the helmet monogram. Equibox has a million different designs and colors, so I was able to select a size, design and color to fit my personal style. Once it arrived, I was thrilled with my choice. It matches the design of all my other monograms, plus I’m pretty particular about the shape of letters and these were perfect. After the initial wonder of how gorgeous the product was wore off, I have to admit, I got a little nervous to put it on. See, I wanted to put it on my IRH, which is velvet (not my plastic Samshield) and I am not crafty at all. So I worried: would it work? Would I struggle? Would it even stay on? So I procrastinated a little bit… but I finally bit the bullet and did it. Equibox Equestrian sent detailed instructions, and I’m so grateful that they did — it took all my anxiety away as I read just how easy it was. Literally all I had to do was peel one side of the backing off, press it on, and peel the other side off.

I held my breath and looked… IT IS PERFECT. Smaller than most, yes, but exactly the understated personal touch I was looking for. And it’s held up for the last month with no issues whatsoever; no peeling, no fading, nothing.

The Recommendation

Equibox Equestrian is the real deal. If you’re looking for high-quality, custom products made by a store that values customer service above all else, this store is for you. Their products are well made, unique and the application (if needed) is foolproof. I honestly cannot say enough to express how truly impressed I am with Equibox. I love my bridle charm, it suits me so perfectly, and the monogram is just my style. And trust me, it’s not always easy to please this hunter princess.

We need a Farm Bill that is as good for farmers and the land as it is for eaters.

The Farm Bill debate is currently in full-swing in the U.S. Senate this week. The sprawling legislation covers food stamps, subsidies, international food aid, research grants — it literally dictates what and how we eat. And right now, the Farm Bill gives all the power to the biggest food companies, which they wield with impunity over farmers and consumers. But an amendment to the bill – the Packer Ban, introduced by Senators Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Kent Conrad (D-North Dakota) – could begin to address this unfair advantage that giant food companies have over farmers.

A tiny number of corporations sit between fewer than a million full-time farmers and 300 million eaters. Only a handful of companies sell seeds and fertilizer to farmers, buy their crops and livestock, process the fruits of farmers’ labor into manufactured food, and sell it at a declining number of gigantic supermarket chains. Those that sell supplies and equipment charge farmers high prices. Meanwhile, the processors and meatpackers that buy from farmers pay low, and consumers see a smaller number of choices at often-higher prices at the grocery store.

The lack of competition is especially severe in livestock markets where, between 2000 and 2010, the United States lost 89,000 beef cattle operations (more than 10 percent) and 19,000 hog operations (about 20 percent). Just four companies dominate meat processing in the Unites States, controlling 80 percent of the marketplace. With few buyers, farmers rarely get a competitive price for their livestock. At the local level, there are often only one or two meatpackers buying livestock and often times both companies are represented by the same person, making it impossible for a farmer to negotiate a fair price.

Meatpackers increasingly own their own cattle in order to manipulate the market. The companies buy livestock on the open market when prices are low but slaughter their own livestock when bidding prices rise. This puts long-term, downward pressure on the price of livestock and allows meatpackers to manipulate what farmers and ranchers earn. These persistently low livestock prices effectively work to push small and medium-sized farmers out of business, while still leading to increased consumer food prices because large meatpackers don’t face enough competition to force them to pass on savings to consumers.

Valerie pushed Puna to take on more responsibility as a team leader and to work with an English tutor to broaden Puna’s future opportunities. “We like to use what happens here as examples of success stories,” said Valerie. “And it is not my success, it is what they contribute.”

Puna and Valerie have become close. “She’s so kind, she loves everybody,” Puna says of Valerie. “Most companies want you to speak English. She hires everybody.”

Over the last five years, Puna has taken on greater responsibilities at work. She’s a team leader at the factory, arriving early to set up the line and staying late to do paperwork. Her husband, Chandra Sanyashi, works the night shift.

Grand Prairie Foods is a family-owned factory that makes prepared foods, like breakfast sandwiches, for hotels, hospitals and brands like Hormel.
Factories of all sorts have become increasingly automated, but there’s no easy way to automate putting sausage on a biscuit. The low unemployment rate in Sioux Falls has made workers scarce, which is one of the reasons the Loudenbacks came to rely on the refugee community.
The area’s growing immigrant community has not come without tensions. Last year, refugee resettlement groups decided to bring fewer people to the area, concerned about animosity toward new immigrants. In 2017, President Trump announced he would cap refugee admissions nationwide at 45,000, a historic low.

After she finishes work, Puna comes home and cooks for her family. Puna’s son and mother-in-law, Chabi, often sit by Puna as she makes dinner over the portable gas stove in the garage. “I cook there all the time because if I cook inside it smells bad,” says Puna. “I like my house to smell good.”

He was also told the company, which has an extensive customer list across a wide range of industries including rail, automotive, nuclear and aerospace, had purchased a six acre site at the Walker Business Park in Blackburn for future expansion.

WEC Group commercial director Wayne Wild explained the group’s growth was based on continual investment in cutting edge machinery and in diversification.

He also urged more government support for businesses the size of WEC Group, which aren’t SMEs but are not operating on the scale of industrial giants such as Rolls-Royce.

He said: “We are caught in the middle, between SMEs and the bigger powerhouse groups, and as a result I feel we are being largely ignored.

“The support network exists for SMEs, but if we want to look at European funding, for instance, then we have to do it ourselves, with no support at all. And we have to finance the bid ourselves.”

The shadow cabinet member, who was accompanied by local Labour parliamentary candidate Will Straw on his visit, said Britain needed more companies like WEC. And he said laying out policies to support job-creating businesses would play an important part in the unfolding election campaign.

He said: “For me it is incredibly important. The point of our policies is to grow those sectors of the economy that produce decent, fulfilling, well-paid jobs and help us pay our way in the world and compete.

“A business like WEC Group illustrates what we are trying to achieve more of. It has grown through sustainable long-term investment, has a good business model, treats its workers well and therefore has good levels of productivity.

“The problem is, we as a country don’t have enough companies like the WEC Group.”

He said the government needed to back sectors like engineering and added it was important to provide access to sources of capital so businesses could invest in the long term.

And he also praised WEC Group’s award-winning training academy – the only one of its kind in the country, saying: “We have a chronic skill shortage.”
Ten per cent of the WEC workforce is now made up of apprentices. It has invested £1m in the programme since its launch.

This game reminded us there is no clock in baseball. But the game itself is like a minute hand, slowly circling around until it hits each number again.

In the eighth inning, Hosmer made an error that nearly cost his team the game. With a runner on second and the game tied, 3–3, New York’s Wilmer Flores hit a sharp ground ball toward Hosmer at first. Hosmer should have made sure he kept the ball in front of him, so the runner couldn’t score. But that’s easy to type and harder to do in an instant. As Hosmer said later, “It’s one of those plays where you’ve got to decide whether you’re going in and get it, or sit back and get the hop. I was a little in between, but tried to go and charge it.”

The ball hit the side of his glove; Hosmer admitted he “definitely” should have made the play. The runner scored; Hosmer thought that would win the game for the Mets.

But then came the ninth. Gordon took the Mets' dominant closer, Jeurys Familia, as deep as any hitter can, over the centerfield fence. Hosmer was stunned. He didn’t even know what to say. He hugged Gordon.

“I was the happiest person in the stadium at that point,” Hosmer said. “I had no words, That’s all I could tell him, was, ‘I just want to hug you right now.’”

The minute hand was swinging toward Hosmer again. He struck out swinging in the bottom of the 10th. He was intentionally walked in the 12th​, and the Royals failed to score.

And then came the 14th.

Baseball’s longest games often end suddenly, with one swing. That was not the case in Game 1. In the 14th​ inning, the Mets slowly suffocated. Third baseman David Wright bobbled an Escobar ground ball, and his rushed throw to first base pulled Lucas Duda off the bag; Escobar was safe. Duda had to hold the speedy shortstop on first, and that allowed Ben Zobrist to poke a single through the hole that Duda had vacated. Escobar advanced to third with no outs

2016 release from the Dutch singer/songwriter. Fake It Till We Die is Anouk's eleventh studio album and the follow-up to Queen For A Day, which was released earlier this year. After Anouk Teeuwe's breakthrough in 1997, she's had numerous hit singles in the Dutch and Belgian charts. Anouk represented the Netherlands at the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 in Malmö, Sweden. Her song made it to the final - the first since 2004 for the Netherlands; and finished ninth. Anouk's musical style has been described as a combination of Joan Osborne, Melissa Etheridge and Alanis Morissette. She is known for explosive rock songs but has also made small and fragile songs. In addition to her pop/rock sound, she also experiments with soul, funk and hip hop.

'Fake It Till We Die' is the brand new studio album by controversial Dutch pop/rock singer Anouk. Her eleventh studio album is full of personally tinted songs. The first single is 'Down Daddy Down'. 'Fake It Till We Die' is the follow-up to 'Queen For A Day' which was released earlier this year in March. For this album Anouk once again worked with her regular producer duo from Sweden, Tore Johansson and Martin Gjerstad. Anouk is playing three live shows in the Ziggo Dome, Amsterdam on the 24st, 27th and 31st of May 2017, of which two shows are already sold-out.

They are mostly promotional tools for me, otherwise I wouldn’t bother wasting more time on the computer with them. The newest fad that I like, are widgets. These cool looking “online ads” are bits of code that these social media sites allow you to paste your info onto blogs and any other online sources.

Online Forums: the most obvious benefit to these is to network with your peers. A side benefit to this is that the photographers that you develop relationships with can end up in a link trade which helps with search engine rankings. Also, these are people that you can swap insights with, image critiques, and good company to go shooting with. I regularly participate on the Nature Photographers Network because these are people whom I consider to be my peers. Photo.net is also a great source for general information though I don’t actively participate on that site. A good idea to employ with these sites is to include your URL’s in your signature as a promotional tool for your website every time that you comment in addition to being link juice. I would also recommend spending some time on the photo business forums which are listed under the links on the right. I won’t elaborate on Flickr right now because I have serious reservations about the overall culture of that site.

Twitter: Many people use this to “tweet” every detail of their personal lives, but I try to minimize that in favor of promoting my photography activities. I have some photographers on my follow list on Twitter so it’s a good word of mouth PR outlet. Twitter is pretty mainstream with the web 2.0 crowd so it is definitely worth investigating. Even art buyers follow photographers on Twitter so it’s an easy way to provide updates on what you’re doing professionally. Another cool thing about Twitter is the widget that you can put on your blog to help your readers keep up to date with you.

Become a fan of my Facebook artist profile in order to enter a drawing for 10, 12×18 inch Lightjet Archival fine art prints of your choice.

Facebook is another source where you can add your RSS feeds and mass-email people on your friends list. Almost everyone uses Facebook these days so if you have the right contacts then it could be worth your time. Beware that it is easy to get sucked into time-waste mode on this site with all the games and stuff you can add to your private profile. I’m guilty of it.

Hollinger's "postethnic" ideal and culturism

David Hollinger’s Postethnic America: Beyond Multiculturalism is one of the most famous books on diversity in academia today. Hollinger seeks to gently guide us away from the excesses of multiculturalism, without abandoning our modern appreciation of cultural pluralism. But he does not really guide us anywhere. Rather than going "beyond multiculturalism," we need to turn in a culturist direction.

His term “Postethnic” denotes a concept by which we can both maintain and transcend our heritage. The “ethnic” part recognizes that there is some diversity and allows you to choose to identify with it. The “post” part means you recognize that the ethnic identites are not solid. I share his enthusiasm for ethnic intermarriage and agree that the government should ditch ethnicity boxes on its forms. But his "postethnic" idea is too easy. He is really just a fancy multiculturalist.

Hollinger says, to avoid balkanization, we need to have culturally neutral “civic nations." Herein, he commits a serious multiculturalist fallacy. The West has a culture. Democracy, separation of church and state, freedom of speech and thinking females should have rights are not universal. The multicultural idea that Western nations are just neutral spaces for random cultures to congregate denies our heritage and undermines our soveriegnty.

Hollinger notes that warrior Masai masters treat their women with less respect than cattle. Clitoridectomy and Saudi values do not accord with those of western feminists. But once people with such values move here, Hollinger assures us that we will be able to talk them into human rights culture via “intersubjective reason.” This means all diversity will naturally and quickly give way to Western values without any culturist policies because diversity is apparent, but not real.

Unlike multiculturalists, culturism takes culture seriously. Basic cultural disagreements exist and conflict happens. Some cultures value education less than others. Some prize big families that start at early ages. Some cultures have seriously anti-Western values. Some believe in polygamy. Some cultures applaud criminality, some are violent. Hollinger's idea that "we can all just get along" because competition and diversity don't really exist,

Go Greek at this new Andheri eatery

By Ruchika Kher |Posted 09-Jun-2014

Just-opened Gyros takes a risk by dishing out Greek fare in Andheri's buzzing Lokhandwala market that is already abuzz with popular food options. But a steady flow of patrons is proof that they’re on the right track

Gyros Food: TastyService: QuickAmbiance: Cosy

Greek food in Lokhandwala? The news did raise our eyebrows, but nevertheless, we couldn’t miss the opportunity of tasting a rarely available cuisine in an area that is otherwise famous for its chaat stalls, bakeries, and fast food hangouts. So, we dropped by the all-white Gyros on a weekday evening.

The joint isn’t very spacious, but we found a corner. Soon, we scoured the menu and called for Hummus With Pita Bread (Rs 100), Chicken Souvlaki (Rs 175), Feta Fries (Rs 100) and Watermelon Feta Salad (Rs 160).

Chicken Souvlaki was a meal in itself

While we were waiting for our Greek spread, we chatted up with the owner, Akash Bhagchandka, about the profitability of opening a Greek restaurant in such a spot. Bhagchandka apprised us that since this cuisine is an untapped market in Mumbai, it was a well-thought out decision and the increasing footfall speaks for itself.

By now, the Hummus and Pita Bread showed up. While the bread was average, the hummus was flavoursome and did wonders to our tastebuds. Next up, we tucked into the Chicken Souvlaki that includes a pita sandwich stuffed with chicken chunks, lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes, olives, onions, potato fries and feta, tossed in lemon vinaigrette dressing. We loved the wholesome dish that had an engaging blend of flavours.

The fries were a tasty side order with the sauce created out of feta cheese, lemon vinaigrette and tzatziki, adding an edge to the regular potato dish. However, the winner of the evening was the Watermelon Feta Salad, which had garnished watermelon with toasted nuts, feta and lettuce. The salad was perfect for a humid summer evening; the subtle riot of flav

Brooke (an enjoyably goofy Greta Gerwig), the ebullient flake in writer-director Noah Baumbach's Mistress America, also becomes the unwitting subject of someone else's art project — though unlike David Foster Wallace, Brooke is a fictional creation. A 30-year-old self-described autodidact, she's the not-yet-stepsister of Tracy (Lola Kirke), a Barnard freshman having trouble fitting in at college who falls in love with Brooke's glamorously haphazard New York life. Brooke's trying to open a restaurant/general store/salon in Williamsburg, between tutoring and teaching classes at SoulCycle and freelancing as an interior designer. She knows everyone; she gets invited onstage to sing with a band; she has a wealthy offscreen boyfriend in Greece who she describes as "the kind of person I hate, except I'm in love with him." She is, basically, an encapsulation of new New York bohemianism and knows it, and Tracy turns out to be her perfect, adoring audience, a receptacle for all of her thoughts and advice on life and love.

Tracy's also using Brooke as the unknowing subject of a short story she hopes will get her an invitation into New York literary society, a story that borrows details and lines from the real deal while casting her as an ill-fated, aging heroine, a remnant of a city that no longer has room for her. It's not a particularly flattering portrayal, but it's also not inaccurate, which adds to the sting. Like a magazine profile writer, Tracy has fit Brooke's life into a narrative. The story is the ticking time bomb, the confrontation waiting to happen in Baumbach's briskly paced, concentrated comedy, which is so packed with clever quips that it wavers between delightful and distancing. Brooke airily notes that people steal from her all the time, especially her ideas, before she seems to get anything done herself. Her life might be a muse, for Tracy and others, but they actually make things, while she continually finds herself with nothing.

It can be a thankless job, being the subject of someone else's story, even if it means you get the spotlight. Brooke, unlike Wallace, isn't an artist herself. Her life is her great product, and it's a wonderful thing, shown giddily

Wearing eye shimmer is not a big task. You should just know how to do it properly. All you need is a great eye shimmer, a make-up brush, a makeup applicator and a little time to experiment at home before heading to the special occasion.

Powder eye shimmer works well for normal to oily skin while cream-based eyeshadows are best for dry skin.

Steps to apply Eye Shimmer

Wash your face properly and apply moisturizer to make the skin smooth.

Apply a foundation matching your skin tone and blend it evenly with your skin. This will remove any dark circles, red blemishes and fine lines surrounding your eyes. Use a special under eye concealer for under eye bags. You have prepared a base for your eye makeup.

First, apply a light layer of eyeshadow primer matching your dress on the eye-lids and beneath the eyes. Make sure the eyeshadow matches the colour of shimmer you intend to wear. Line your lower eyelids with an eye pencil of the same colour for a more dramatic look.

Apply eye liner near the eye lids. You can use a liquid or a pencil eye liner. It can also be applied on your lower eyelid. Leave it to dry.

Now dip the brush in the shimmer, blow off the extra shimmer and then, gently apply it on the eye-lids. Apply the shimmer towards outer direction. Another alternative is to wet the brush a little, dip it into the shimmer powder and apply on the eyes. This will make sure that the shadow sticks to your eyelids for a longer time.

Mix the shimmer properly with brush. Remove the extra shimmer with a tissue.

Liquid or cream eye shimmers are easy to apply compared to powder eye shimmer. Distribute the product evenly on your upper eyelid. For a little extra glamour, add a touch of powder eye shimmer and finish off with a gorgeous shimmery mascara.

Always use a light coloured shimmer to highlight the eyebrow region. It is applied below the eyebrows to enhance their look.

The shimmer of a darker colour is applied on rest of the eyelid.

You can apply shimmer on eyelashes too. Just dip the mascara brush in the shimmer and apply it on the lashes. It will give a sense of sparkle to your eyes.

But people most often serve it with desserts, and sometimes it seems like a competition, which is sweeter, the wine or the dessert? And the wine can start to seem bland or boring. Last night I went to a dinner party and took a 375 of Ch. Suduiraut, 2001. The hostess made a cake which had alternating layers flavored with Meyer Lemon or orange. The sweetness of the dessert was subdued and the flavors were subtle, Meyer lemon can be very mild in flavor. Also Louise made her Alsatian Apple Pie -- in which the crust, the apples, and the spicy custard are cooked separately and then combined and baked to finish. It's a great dessert but it didn't have the same chemistry with the Sauternes that the cake did.

The 2001 Suduiraut had an orangey element in the flavor which was subtle when you tasted the wine alone -- I also noticed a little cinnamon, and honey, and the usual botrytis flavors. The wine had darkened to an orangey color. With a bite of cake, it was just spectacular, the orange flavor was like a neon sign. I don't think I have ever been so impressed by the sum being greater than the parts, great wine, great cake, but together, a nuclear reaction!

I've asked for the recipe for that cake but don't have it yet. Just couldn't help but mention it. I wonder if you guys have had the experience of finding a food match that just utterly improved the perception of the wine? I know that has happened for me on a lesser scale with red wines (steak and Bordeaux, Champagne and popcorn?) but it's hard to summon up specific examples.

I'll offer up a strange one: a thick cut of roast beef and a glass of ruby port. It's like the steak-and-cabernet thing but emphasized by the extra sweetness. (A very sweet wine would not work; you really want a modest cup for it.)

Jeff, some of us are old enough to remember alt.food.wine. There was a flamboyant woman who posted on that, I think she presented herself as a "dominatrix" -- very colorful. But she insisted that people should try surprising wine matches and I think one of them was good Port with a hamburger. It always struck me as something that would really work, I like Port and I am sure it would match beef at least as

Though Madrid were overwhelming favourites to establish a healthy lead in the opening instalment of their quarter-final tie Nicosia, they were forced to wait until the closing 16 minutes before goals from Karim Benzema either side of a Kaká effort broke the hosts' resolve. José Mourinho's side were the dominant force throughout, however, and were rarely troubled by APOEL.

"In the first half, we started strong," said Pepe. "They were defending and we had possession. We tried to penetrate their defence but we couldn't. In the second half, we improved and took advantage of the chances we got. It was an important victory. The whole team contributed to make sure that we, the defenders, had rather a quiet night. Everybody worked very well together.

"It was an important match for us; we needed to be very concentrated because APOEL may not be a 'big' team, but their players work hard. They're a very organised side and I think the team needs to be congratulated."

It was only after Mourinho shuffled his pack just past the hour, replacing Fábio Coentrão and Gonzalo Higuaín with Marcelo and Kaká, that the Merengues found that clinical edge. Kaká played a key role by setting up Benzema for the opener and scoring the second.

"I am happy with my participation for 30 minutes," said the Brazilian playmaker. "I made use of the opportunity I had. I scored a goal, I provided an assist. I am also happy with the victory; we took a big step towards the semi-finals. My aim is to help the team in my own way."

Benzema, who took his UEFA Champions League goal tally for the season to seven to trail only Mario Gomez and Lionel Messi, conceded the game was not as straightforward as the final score suggests. "It was a very difficult match, especially in the first half," he said. "In the second, we played better and achieved a very important victory. We will continue at the same pace in the second leg as well."

New Drug Combination Holds Promise

A San Diego drug company, BrainCells Inc., made an announcement in August of 2009 that caught psychiatrists by surprise. A clinical trial conducted by BrainCells showed that depression sufferers found relief when treated with a strange regimen of an anti-anxiety medication combined with a garden-variety dietary supplement. Half a year later, the company is taking giant steps toward turning that discovery into a marketplace hit.

BrainCells tested buspirone, a low-dose generic medication for anxiety, in tandem with melatonin, a common over-the-counter supplement on 142 patients. Researcher Mauricio Fava, a vice chair of psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital said that the effect of this double therapy was every bit as effective as standard treatments for depression, such as, say, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Since then, BrainCells has been working on getting their product out on the market.

Novel Therapy

This combination therapy has been the talk of the psychiatric community and represents a brand new way of treating depression. The innovative medication is different than anything seen before because it works by stimulating the brain to produce new neurons (neurogenesis). The impact of a novel type of therapy cannot be overestimated since some 20 million U.S. citizens suffer from depression.

Current medications don't work for all and have a tendency to cause unpleasant side effects such as sexual dysfunction and weigh gain. BrainCells combo drug/supplement didn't cause similar side effects so can be seen as a serious option for a huge number of people. CEO for BrainCells, Jim Schoeneck comments, “The depression data we showed has really been the big story over the past few months.”

User-Friendly

But of course, a great deal of groundwork must be done to pave the way for the drug to find its way to your drugstore's shelves. First, the drug needs to undergo more clinical testing, and then it needs to win FDA clearance to market the drug, which has received the code name BCI-952. Also, the first trial had participants taking two different pills, and the company must come up with a one-pill formula to make it truly marketable and user-friendly. According to Schoeneck, BrainCells is working toward creating an oral pill that can be taken once daily, just before bed. The company also needs to make sure it's got things squared away in terms of

Police said four burqa-clad militants opened fire on the gates of the Agriculture Training Institute, injuring the guard before making their way inside.

Peshawar Police Chief Muhammad Tahir Khan said three gunmen had been killed and that security forces were carrying out a clearance operation inside the building to track down for any remaining militants.

"The clearance operation is under way," he told AFP.

Spokeswomen for two hospitals in the city said they had received a total of nine bodies and were treating some 38 injured, including several in critical condition.

A spokesman for the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, Muhammad Khurasani, claimed responsibility for the attack in a telephone call to AFP.

"Our mujahids have attacked the building because it was used as office for ISI, God willing our fighters will fight till the last drop of blood," he said, referring to Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence agency.

Noor Wali, a 19-year-old student at the institute, described a terrifying ordeal that began when he was woken by gunshots.

"I rushed to the door and saw a fountain of blood pumping out of the shoulder of my roommate who was standing outside the room," he told AFP.

He and another student rushed to his aid, and hid from the gunmen for almost an hour before they were rescued by security forces.

"The other student was pressing the wound with his hands to stop the blood and I had to put my hand on his mouth so that he cannot scream," he said.

"We took shelter inside the bedroom and were begging the injured student not to make any sound as the terrorists might hear it and kill us."

The area where the incident occurred is a hub for educational institutions in the city including the University of Peshawar.

An interior ministry official told AFP that cellular networks had been suspended in various cities across the country for security reasons.

The incident comes amid tight security across Pakistan as it celebrates the birthday of the Prophet Mohammed.

The country is tense after weeks-long anti-blasphemy protests in Islamabad that saw seven killed and hundreds wounded in clashes with police.

This makes sense for a computer that is acting as a server. If you are logged in from multiple locations, and you enter the password for sudo in your current location, all the other locations are still “safe” since the person using the other terminals will still have to enter the password to use sudo. But when it comes to desktop use, this behaviour can be an annoyance.

I hate being prompted again and again for the sudo password (and the graphical gksudo password). For me, on my laptop, I want the sudo password to be “shared” between the different terminal windows, and with gksudo. It would be nice if the timestamp on the password was “global” to all terminals, and all the “gksudo” menu entries.

I ensure this by changing the following line in /etc/sudoers:Defaults !lecture,tty_tickets,!fqdn

toDefaults !lecture,!tty_tickets,!fqdn

Here, tty_tickets refers to “terminal tickets”, and I just changed it from using one ticket per terminal, to a common ticket, globally.

Again, this is not recommended for server installs, but may make life a little easier for average Joe Desktop Users.

I’m not sure how secure this is. I’m already not confortable with sudo remembering the password…
Imagine some malware that uses sudo to get root privileges. if sudo remembers the pass, it wont ask for it and the malware will get the permissions right aware. than, you’re pretty much screwed.

Root concept for desktop users should not be in the focus of security discussions. System configuration data is wrecked by automatic updates every two or three weeks in ubuntu, so the occasional user error will only be a drop in the bucket.
Furthermore, user data stored in HOME should be protected a lot better than the rest of the system for user privacy issues. It isn’t the sixties anymore, unix is used as a home computing OS nowadays.

@randomwalker You don’t seem to have understood. If I gain access to ‘the stuff in /’, then I have elevated privileges, very likely root. That gives me access to your files in $HOME, and much worse, it also enables me to install Trojaned executables that log your passwords and send them to a dead-drop in Albania that I monitor via my botnet.

I just looked those up, and, holy shit, those are $150 NEW?? Hard to go wrong. Plus, the description on the GC website starts with "Perfect for the raucous sound of indie music, the Bullet Mustang HH is just plain fun to play."

I need to do some work to level the f

The volatility of the digital currency markets was on display again Wednesday, as bitcoin briefly fell below $10,000 before rebounding back above $11,000 in the U.S. afternoon.

With the drop below $10,000, bitcoin had lost about half its value since hitting a high above $19,000 in mid-December. Other digital currencies bounced around as well.

Bitcoin has slumped 20 percent this week as traders worry that regulators in South Korea will crack down on trading of digital currencies. The price of bitcoin fell as much as 20 percent Wednesday, but later recovered and was nearly flat at $11,392 around 5:10 p.m. Eastern Time, according to Coindesk.

Bitcoin hasn’t caught on as a currency for buying things, as intended. But it has drawn huge interest from traders, and its price has soared over the past year, and has also had several sharp drops.

The price of one bitcoin went from $1,000 at the beginning of last year to nearly $20,000 in mid-December. The latest plunge brings the price back to where it was in early December.

Many financial pros believe bitcoin is in a speculative bubble that could crash any time.

The possibility that South Korea will ban or restrict virtual currency trading has weighed on traders’ minds the last few weeks because the nation is a major market for currencies like bitcoin.

Those worries have also depressed the prices of other digital currencies that gained sharply in recent months.

Ethereum fell 9 percent to $993 Wednesday, according to Coindesk. During the day it tumbled as much as 26 percent. Its current price is still roughly double where it was in November, and down sharply from its recent peak of $1,329 on Jan. 10.

Bitcoin and other digital currencies trade on private exchanges that have little regulation or protection for investors. In December two major financial exchanges, the Cboe and CME, started trading in bitcoin futures, which allow investors to make bets on the future price of bitcoin without actually holding bitcoins.

Bitcoin futures on the Cboe were little changed while CME-traded futures slipped 2 percent. Earlier they hit their lowest levels since trading began last month.

Bitcoin is extremely hard to value because it has no country or central bank backing it and it’s not widely used to make transactions. Its value is tied only to what people believe it is worth

Thank you Quiltermomma - I love these two beautiful blocks that you made for me. I am intrigued by the color combinations and the design - I have looked at this pattern but never been brave enough to try it. These are the first two blocks for my new quilt that I will make from my monthly swaps - I am so blessed with these two beautiful blocks and the gorgeous applique quilt from quiltermomma - I am the luckiest swapper ever!

"Make new friends but keep the old, one is silver and the other gold" - Friends on this Quilting Board are treasures indeed!

I received my block from Roe (Rosalie) yesterday and I love it - love the style of the block. Here's pics of the one she sent me and the ones I sent her. The 'windmill' block was a test, but it turned out a wee bit short - it was too pretty to pitch so sent it anyway. She liked both and said she'd use them in her quilt. I love this swap - hope we keep it up. It's been so quiet last couple months, guess everyone is busy w/outdoor work. Keep in touch everyone..;o)

Jean............I just LOVE the blocks you have made for your partner!! They are all so pretty & the color's are wonderful. I haven't participated for the last year, but hopefully I can return in the Fall.

Well now- big bummer. I did up the two blocks for my June swap partner and I love them. But they have a problem. Sigh. Seems I overshot the sentence in the pattern where it instructs the sewer to use '1/4 scant seams'. Agh.

But my partner is amazing - I told her my dilemma and that I

South Sudan is pleading with Kenya and Uganda for economic support to avert a humanitarian crisis after a fresh conflict brought the country to its knees.

Last week, a delegation of Transitional Government of South Sudan officials led by First Vice-President Taban Deng Gai was in Kenya on a mission seeking a bailout.

Africa Reviewreported that Juba will also be reaching out to Uganda later this month to craft a bailout package that will see Kampala pay its traders the $35.2 million Juba owes them in a bid to have them resume supplies to the country.

“The vice president will go to Kampala to request the Ugandan government to pay traders who supplied cereals to Juba but haven’t been paid. The money will then be converted into a loan, for which Juba and Kampala officials will work out a repayment plan,” a diplomatic source with the knowledge of the matter said.

The delegation to Nairobi, which included four ministers, met with Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, Cabinet Secretary for Foreign Affairs Amina Mohamed and a number of government officials.
A source privy to the discussions said Mr Gai implored President Kenyatta to give his country a soft loan to help it deal with its current problems.

President Kenyatta is reported to have advised the group to send their finance minister, their Central Bank Governor and agriculture minister to Nairobi with a clear proposal, including the amounts needed and the modalities for repayment.

Uganda is South Sudan’s biggest trading partner and exports maize, vegetables, sugar, iron and steel, cement, beer, motor lubricants and detergents. However, following fresh fighting in the country in July, most foreign traders have returned to their countries for security reasons.

In an interview, South Sudan Finance minister Stephen Dhieu Dau declined to provide details on how the proposal would be structured.
“I am yet to get a briefing on the discussions in Nairobi and any other that will take place. However, we are pursuing fiscal, monetary and diplomatic routes in a bid to unlock the economic challenge the country is facing,” Mr Dau said.
The country is also yet to pass a new budget for the 2016/17 financial year.

Jet mud mixer is a combination of centrifugal pump and mixing
hopper with pipeline. The mud mixer is scientifically designed to
be the optimal solution for mixing of both mud bulk material and
mud additive chemicals into the drilling fluid.

Jet Mud Mixer Description

As its structure we also call it as mixing hopper pump or mud mixing pump. When the drilling fluid need to be mixed or compounded to change
density, viscosity, dehydration we’ll need the bentonite or barite,
also other polymers. When we feed the material directly into tank
there will be big concentration ball or sedimentation. Especially
when there might happen blow out, we need mix large quantity
drilling fluid in short time. However, the mixture or agitation
have to be finished via assistant equipment-jet mud mixer.

So the mud mixing pump is mainly to weight or configure proper
drilling fluid for whole drilling mud solids control system. The
jet mud mixer can be designed as dual hopper with dual pump, please
contact us for more custom built service confirmation

What impact mud mixing pump?

Mixing hopper hydraulic consumption should be as little as
possible, otherwise the flow rate may decrease by too much

Distance between Venturi hopper and nozzle should be proper. The
optimal distance should be 32~90mm

Output pressure should be designed properly. If the discharge port
pressure is too high the flow rate of mixing pump will

The rising cost of college is at the forefront of the higher education debate. College costs are rising four times faster than family income, putting a postsecondary education further out of reach for low-income students.

Low-income students are often the first in their family to attend college and are at higher risk of dropping out because of unmet need—the gap between college costs and what students can afford to pay on their own and/or with aid that does not need to be repaid. One option available to address this gap is state need-based aid, which is awarded based on income and other financial factors (as opposed to academic performance). However, a recent report shows that, despite recent modest increases, state funding for such programs is still too low to measurably improve college access and success for low-income students.

Despite the proven success of need-based aid in reducing students’ financial burdens, investments to date have been far too small. In 2012-13, the average full-time community college student still had more than $6,000 in unmet need. According to the most recent report from the National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs (NASSGAP), in 2011-12, the 50 states and District of Columbia spent a total of $6.8 billion on need-based grant aid for college students. While this is a 6 percent increase from the previous year, it averages out to only $482 per enrolled undergraduate student—less than one-fifth of what the federal government spent on Pell Grants, the primary federal grant program to help millions of low-income students access postsecondary education. California, New York, and Texas led all states with the amount of need-based undergraduate grant aid awarded to students in 2011-12.

All the available data shows that investing in an individual’s education and training provides states with a more skilled and educated workforce and improves states’ economies in both the short and long term. In a joint study of all 50 states with the Center on Wisconsin Strategy (COWS), CLASP describes just how many workers need better skills and wages to become self-sufficient and promote economic growth in their state. This is consistent with research by the Economic Policy Institute, which finds that by increasing access to higher education, states will “expand economic opportunity and…do more to strengthen the overall state economy than anything else a state government can do.”

Many states are holding off on new investments until they have fully recovered from the recession, but students

As always, I pulled myself out of bed and did what I needed to do before coming downstairs and putting on the kettle. Whilst waiting for it to boil, I opened the back doors as I always do and suddenly was hit with nothing. Total silence. I stepped outside and breathed in and listened again – nothing. The air was still. The early morning sun was just beginning to bathe the garden in half-light and the chilly nip was still in the air.

Instead of walking back into the house, I stood a moment and just looked at the sky; at the vapour trails that I could clearly see, at the trees behind me in which lurked squirrels, pigeons and all manner of other birds and I breathed deeply again. It was a truly beautiful and serene moment and I found myself thinking actually, this was pretty special. If I had stayed in bed like my body demanded, I would have missed this. I would have got up when the rest of the world was up, when the cars would be trundling along the road in the distance, when the dogs would be barking on their walks out the back and I would never have known that this serenity existed.

Serenity…early morning sun in the UK

I always remember my grandparents being early risers and I used to think that they were crazy. Why get out of bed when you don’t have to? But now, having enjoyed the moment that I did today, I am wondering if it was me that was missing out after all.

With the extra time I have managed to write this blog post and will hopefully be able to spend some time visiting other blogs. In addition, I will probably be able to get some work done.

Maybe the early bird really does catch the worm?

Thoughts anyone? Are you early risers or do you stay in bed til the last minute?

I have a habit of always waking up a few minutes before an alarm. Even if it isn’t meant for me, I seem to know when I have 5 minutes to go. Never really understood the sadistic reasoning behind the things anyway. Who ever thought it was a great idea to start the day being jolted awake by a loud noise?

The day starts at 5:10 AM. Even on the weekend, my favorite time is early morning on the deck at my cabin, watching

It means less amplifier power is needed for more audio output. Meaning better sound and more volume using less power. The bottom line is db Loudspeakers will definitely blow you and your friends away, whether they're driven by aftermarket head units or factory installed electronics. (If you really want to punch your music up, check out our PA amplifiers.)
Advanced Component Systems

Component models have a vented crossover housing and hidden wire channels for an easier, more professional-looking install. All component models use a 2nd-order Butterworth outboard crossover for component system sound - at a coaxial price.

Hey, maybe a full-blown component system and a db sub enclosure in a SmartCar isn't all that practical. Some db Coaxials will fill the bill quite nicely, thank you. There are three new db models not previously offered in the db line: a 3-1/2 inch diameter coaxial, a 4x6 plate-style speaker and a 6-1/2 inch Slim Mount coaxial for easy fit into shallow doors.

The 6-1/2 inch sized db651 and db651S models come with 6-3/4 inch adaptor rings for easy fit in VWs, Audis, BWMs and other European cars.

Marine Certified means your db loudspeakers will perform reliably on the water as well as they do on land. So we attacked every db speaker with a series of punishing real world and accelerated weathering lab tests to see if they could take what some pretty nasty marine and automotive environments could dish out. We exposed dbs to hundreds of hours of salt fog, intense ultraviolet light and extreme temperatures from -40° to 185° F (-40° to 85° C). They performed as well after the tests as before (they didn't look so good). No wonder Correct Craft® builds Polk Audio speakers into their award-winning Nautiques® ski and wakeboarding boats, and Bullet® uses Polk db speakers in their marine "tower" speaker enclosures.

Comments: I have not gotten to use these speakers for an extended period of time so I do not know anything about their durability. I do feel they are a high quality speaker option to upgrade the front speakers. You must purchase or make an adapter bracket to mount the speakers as the stock ones aren't the same size. I would recommend them to anyone.

Comments: These Polks along with the stock front speakers and a

Hey Girl Moguls! It’s Poppy here, and with Earth Day coming up this month, I just wanted to share something cool with you about what Michelle Obama and the Obama girls are doing to go Green! Michelle Obama started the first White House “kitchen garden” since Eleanor Roosevelt and planted a bunch of healthy vegetables in it like lettuce, spinach, broccoli, onions, carrots and peas. This garden will grow food for the entire Obama family and everyone—Michelle, Sasha, Malia and even President Obama—will all help to care for it. Starting a garden is such a great thing to do; not only does it save money on food shopping, but it can be really relaxing to work on and is a great encouragement to eat healthy!

As most of you know, I grew up on a farm so I know a lot about gardening and taking care of plants. If you’re interested in starting your own garden, you don’t always have to start big—you can find a small plot of land in your backyard to begin or, if it’s too cold outside, start growing your plants indoors in plant pots! Wherever you start growing your plants, make sure it’s in a spot with lots of sunshine. There are two different ways you can start your garden: you can either grow them from seeds or from small plants called seedlings. Figure out what kind of vegetables you want to grow and what grows well in your area. Don’t be discouraged if your vegetables don’t grow right away—it takes time! Gardening and farming both require being really patient, so relax and let your plants enjoy the sun!

P.S. Even if you don’t want to grow your own vegetable garden, you can encourage your family to buy locally grown fruits and vegetables. In addition to being fresher and tastier, buying locally grown food helps the environment since food doesn’t have to travel far and waste gas to get to you!

I love when people discover their life passions! I love when those passions can be translated into a business that benefits others.When you hear the history and formation of Newton's Attic, you realize that this is precisely the case with this business. Bill Cloyd began as a young boy on a farm gathering useful, undervalued materials and testing the bounds of physics. As a teenager he perfected his free fall by building an 80 foot tower using his neighbors' unwanted TV antennae and a circus net. Soon after he built a human catapult and practiced launching people into a nearby pond. The drive and ambition of Cloyd could not be confined to the small space of a classroom. As a mechanical engineering major, it seemed like a good fit to try teaching, but Cloyd soon discovered that his passion for physics was larger than the space allowed. Cloyd felt compelled to start Newton's Attic, a non-profit educational resource that utilizes fun, excitement, and PLAYING as learning tools.So that is the back story of Newton's Attic, but let me tell you about our experience there. As a mother who is used to saying, "Don't touch that! Stop child, you might break something," it was refreshing to hear that my children could tinker with the physics toys and robots on site. "They can touch everything except the table saw," is what we were told. During the two hours that we were visiting, my children ages 3-10 were able to build and launch small rockets, play with a robotic arm, ride a roller coaster, and use an enormous catapult to shoot a weedeater and toaster across the field. As all you mothers of young sons can imagine, watching an appliance fly through the air and then crash into pieces was sheer joy!The staff and the equipment totally engaged our children and built into their minds and spirits. The Newton's Attic helpers (and family) were kind, informative, and inclusive to all the members of our group. The Newton's Attic experience was summed up for me by a brief phrase I heard after the successful weedeater launch. As the kids ran across the open space to retrieve the busted up parts and pieces, I heard one of the staffers remark candidly to the owner, "Is that weedeater string? I might need that for something." Physics at Newton's attic is limited only by your creativity (and the laws of physics). We can only imagine what project will be next...If you want to learn

Celebrate St. Patrick's Day by wearing green, drinking green and going green.Don't panic. You don't have to make your own cleaning products or use cloth diapers. Here are 17 easy ways to be green any day of the year, culled from utility experts to moms everywhere.1. How many times do you forget to bring your bags inside the grocery store? Instead of telling yourself, "OK, next time I'll remember" (you probably won't), just go back to the car and get your bags. 2. Avoid the temptation to use the drive-through lane at pharmacies, banks and fast-food joints. Walk inside, and you'll get a little exercise.3. Wash clothes in cold water. That way you don't turn the whites pink if a red shirt sneaks in with the load. 4. Don't stand there with refrigerator door open while you ponder. There's nothing good in the house to eat anyway.5. Unplug unused cellphone and laptop chargers.6. Pay bills online or by phone. Sign up for electronic statements for bills, banking and credit cards. Stop unwanted mail by going to www.ecocycle.org/junkmail.7. Switch to reusable water bottles and coffee cups.8. Keep tires properly inflated.9. Don't run the water while brushing your teeth.10. Walk the kids to the school bus. Take the bus to outings in Seattle: It saves on parking fees and parking tickets. You can plan a trip at www.soundtransit.org.11. Feeling a tad chilly lounging around the house half-naked in shorts and T-shirt? Put on more clothes rather than cranking up the heat. 12. Use light dimmers and energy-efficient light bulbs. 13. Invest in energy-saving appliances. These really do cut bills. Some qualify for utility and income tax rebates.14. Got lots of grass to mow? Rent a herd of goats. They'll fertilize it while they're at it.15. Get organized. Know where your stuff is. Before you buy an item, look around the house to see whether you already have something that will work just as well. 16. Buy gently used toys at yard sales, thrift stores or online at sites such as www.babyplays.com.17. Relax. Quit expending energy. St. Patrick's Day is a fun holiday. Drink a green beer

In its Citizens United ruling, the court said corporations and unions had a constitutional right to spend as much as they wished on "independent" political efforts. While this is in theory even-handed, in fact corporations have far more money than unions, and they tend to spend it to support Republicans.

The case was decided at the start of 2010, and it didn't take long for its effects to be felt. The "super" political action committees unleashed by the ruling spent $83.7 that year on electioneering, according to the Washington Post.

This year, the deluge. As of May 8, super PACs have raised more than $204 million and spent more than $98.8 million, the Brennan Center said. "In total, outside groups have already spent roughly $121.2 million on federal campaigns, double the amount spent in the same period in 2008."

As disturbing as the total is the fact that so much of this money came from a relatively few wealthy individuals. "More than half of the money collected by super PACs since the beginning of 2011 - almost $110 million - came from donors giving $1 million or more," the Brennan Center said.

This means a relative handful of people can exert a massive impact on the 2012 elections.

We know here in Western North Carolina how that can work. Last-minute attack ads and mailers from two organizations dominated by one man, Art Pope, were considered by many to be largely responsible for the defeat of state Sen. John Snow, of Murphy, in 2010.

The state of Montana has given the Supreme Court a chance to mend its ways. Montana's voters in 1912 enacted a ban on corporate campaign contributions to keep copper companies from controlling state government. It would appear Citizens United has wiped that law off the books.

But Montana has stood firm. Its Supreme Court rebuffed a challenge from Western Tradition Partnership, an anti-environmental group which then took its case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The Citizens United decision is simply terrible. The court ignored its own precedents and went far beyond the case at hand to make a constitutional ruling.

All the plaintiffs had asked was to be allowed to broadcast an anti-Hillary Clinton documentary. They claimed federal prohibitions covered only commercials, not documentaries.

But, as Jeffrey Toobin recounted in The New Yorker, conservative activists on the court saw their chance to gut the McCain-Feingold campaign

However, one of the major benefits of Beard balm, on top of the fact that it will make you smell better and look amazing, is the fact that it conditions your beard and the skin underneath it, softening, moisturising and fighting against the dreaded beardruff. (That's beard dandruff if you didn't know. And yes, it's as gross as it sounds.)

See, your skin produces oils to keep you protected and lubricated, this is why your hair gets greasy after a hard day of working and sweating. It's a protective measure. Problem is, once you start growing a magnificent mound of facial hair, that sucks up a good portion of the oils that would normally go to hydrating and protecting your skin, so the skin under and around your facial hair gets dry and flaky.

Thankfully, a good Beard balm provides everything that your face needs to get back to tip top order, so a few days or regular use will fix all that.

If your face needs serious conditioning, you're going to want to look for an all natural beard balm, like the Honest Amish we recommend above. All natural beard balms are actually safe to leave in all day, so will continue to provide moisture and protection until you next wash your beard.

When is the best time to use my beard balm?

You're going to want to use your Beard balm once a day, and the absolute best time to use it is after you've dried yourself from your morning shower or wash, when your hair and skin are slightly moist, but not soaking wet.

I've been using this for a couple weeks, and I can't help wondering what's in it?

You aren't the only one. In general, there are three main components in a beard balm: Carrier oils, essential oils, and a stabilizing agent.

What's a carrier oil?

Carrier oils are the active ingredients in the balm. The part which actually conditions your skin and softens your beard. They're also exactly the same oils used in beard oils.

Because this is the most important part of a Beard balm, it's not unusual to find Beard balms that only have carrier oils, and no essential oils, especially if they're unscented.

There are three carrier oils commonly used in beard balms;

Grapeseed oil: Ext

You\’re probably going to need to bring cash along for some shops. That\’s why should you call ahead prior to going to inquire about anything they take and what it will surely cost for what you need. There are menus online, but even then that won\’t tell you if there are any restrictions. It might be wise, when you don\’t have enough time to call around, to merely find some good cash over to take with you while you Alhambra pot shop. Certain areas may have an ATM so consider this too when you don\’t have a lot of time.

The shops all have different strains. While some may carry the greater number of common ones that have been a hit in the area, there are gong being more obscure ones that you might like to try. Looking around is normally pretty easy, you can easily go to a website that lists the shops and find out what is in the menu. Certain areas get their own websites that they can update, too. In any case, you must learn what you need and enjoy or at a minimum have to test various Alhambra pot shops to obtain a sense of the strains.

You\’re going to have to have your ID together with you, as if you\’re not old enough the Alhambra dispensary may not sell to you. Typically, anyone under 21 or regardless of the drinking age is where you are won\’t have the ability to buy any marijuana. Keep in mind that you need to have a driver\’s license or an ID which is current or they won\’t work together with you. Also, they are cautious so don\’t attempt to pass off an imitation ID because which gets you banned. If you wish shops to be around, stay with the rules.

Do you know the main difference between sativa, indica, and hybrid plants? People say that the sativa plants get more of a head high while indica is more of any body one. The hybrids are a mixture of both kinds, with one of them sometimes being more prominent compared to other. You can find different smells, too, that mean different things. It\’s vital to start out testing out what you can because many people get anxiety from certain kinds or some make people incapable of get much done as they are too tired.

Early Tuesday, with
100 percent of the votes counted
, Eric Garcetti garnered the most votes among the field of eight candidates with 33 percent of the vote. City Controller Wendy Greuel followed close behind with 29 percent. The results mirrored what both poll and fundraising numbers showed for months – the councilman and controller remain neck-and-neck.

Voters in dozens of municipalities across the Los Angeles region went to the polls Tuesday to vote for mayors, council members and other city offices.

Outside the big contest in Los Angeles, four mayoral seats were up for election, but only one was competitive, in Redondo Beach where Steve Aspel won the office.

Pasadena voters cast ballots in three council districts, but only the Third District in the central part of the city had multiple candidates. In that race, businessman John J. Kennedy outpolled activist Ishmael Trone by 55% to 38%. Kennedy will replace longtime councilman Chris Holden, who won an Assembly seat in November.

I'm wondering if anybody has noticed any wear on the firebox? Fire eats away mild steel. That's why most combustion chambers in stoves etc are lined with firebricks.
The reason I ask is that firebox of the mini or any GF for that matter is not very repairable. The whole firebox is welded to the frame, inner and outer sheeting.
A lot of outdoor furnaces are made of CorTen. They seem to hold up pretty well. In the grand scheme of things switching from mild steel to CorTen might be worthwhile if it prolonges the life smoker. Not that I don't like a DIY project but a long lasting heirloom is always nicer.
Perhaps I'm overthinking this but the question about the durability of the firebox in the GF has never asked.

Keep the ash cleaned out and store it indoors (away from moisture, saltwater and humidity) and it will last a really long time. I’ve been here a number of years and don’t recall anyone having a firebox burn thru on a gravity feed.

@Dirtytires, I've reading along also for some years and have the plans already for two years when more urgent stuff came up. Now I'm trying to start this build again. While discussing the build some buddies suggested using CorTen. But is the CorTen(A) really more resistant to fire than regular fire? And if so could you make the entire firebox out 1/4"? 1/2" CorTen does exist but is rare and expensive. Cutting everything out of a single (gauge) sheet is way more cost effective. But I'm unsure if the reduction in thickness works.

Sorry if I misled you. I have absolutely no experience with CorTen. My point was that we have built hundreds of smokers on this site and burn thru on fireboxes does not appear to be a big issue as long as it’s maintained properly. With that said, I’m not sure ANY further enhancements need to be made.

Keep in mind, a furnace can run 24/7/365. They also use different fuels like natural gas which has more moisture in it. It will take me a lifetime to put a Year’s worth of furnace abuse on a smoker.

I have some experience at a local oil fired power plant. They are more concerned with the number of heat cycles than the heat itself.

McKenzie Fine Art Presents Laura Sharp Wilson 3/24-4/30

McKenzie Fine Art is pleased to announce an exhibition of new paintings by Laura Sharp Wilson, Utah, her third solo exhibition at the gallery. The show opens Thursday, March 24th with a reception for the artist from 6 to 8 p.m.; it runs through Saturday, April 30, 2011.

Working on a small scale, Laura Sharp Wilson's brightly colored acrylic and graphite paintings are her least figurative and most complex to date. They continue her interest in conveying clarity amidst confusion through the use of dense, overlapping patterning and obsessively precise rendering. Abstracted forms, which reflect the artist's interest in ornamentation and excessive decoration, are layered on grounds of colored, back-painted, or masked fields of fibrous or printed paper mounted on wood, imparting both visual and surface texture to the work. Throughout, Wilson has retained the coils, ropes, and vines that encircle, bind, interconnect, dangle from, and at times, nearly strangle her forms.

Writing about the motivations inspiring her new work, Wilson has noted:

Two years ago my family relocated to the state of Utah. This collection of abstract paintings is a response to the weight and density of that move. For someone who loves rain and green vegetation, Utah is a strange, unlikable place. There is a certain stigma to living here when you are an artist, especially if you're a faithless, left-leaning east coaster. But then you get tired of hating the place you live in. The beauty of the snow-covered mountains on a clear day starts to seep in. You become fascinated by the curious overlap of Anasazi, Ute, and Navajo, cowboys, Mormons, U.S. military personnel, and the many souls who journeyed here with the expansion of the west. Roseanne Barr grew up here, Joe Hill died here, Utah Phillips is named for here, and Wallace Stegner learned to write here. The red rock country of southern Utah gets visitors from all over the world, because it looks like another planet. Current-day Utah is an environmental battleground, with the largest open-pit copper mine in the world, wolves and bison, a nuclear testing legacy, oil and gas drilling, and some of the worst air quality in the country. Utah, being a red state, struggles over rights for same-sex couples, and some of

And so, today, RIM announced its Hail Mary - a brand new mobile operating system (well, sort-of new), as well as two new devices. In addition, the Canadian company also officially changed its name from Research In Motion to Blackberry. The firstfewreviews of Blackberry 10 are already out, and it's not bad. The problem, however, is that in the case of Blackberry, 'not bad' could easily mean 'not good enough'.

BlackBerry did something interesting today, they showed a great deal of finesse in their execution with BB10. Let's remember, this is a product which is late to market, in a crowded environment, from a vendor which has had a pretty dramatic fall from grace and suffered from chronic mismanagement for quite some time.

The fact that BlackBerry is seemingly firing on all pistons is encouraging from a management point of view, and speaks volumes to their ability as a company to deliver in the future.

Is BB10 perfect? Will it achieve a meaningful uptake the first time around? No and probably not. But it doesn't have to be.

It has to be good enough to buy BlackBerry time to iterate on their product. I think they have a few unique selling points and I'm more optimistic after today than I was before.

The app number count is impressive, at the least. The real question is how they can over time turn these "port-a-thons" into organic interest in the platform. Is BlackBerry in the conversation when it comes to developers writing new apps? Do they differentiate on BlackBerry by integrating with the platform?

Microsoft has found that its very easy to strong arm yourself 100,000 apps, but its not so easy to change minds and hearts of developers when it comes to considering Windows Phone along with iOS and Android during initial product planning.

I'm bullish because BlackBerry has strong loyalty and strong carrier relations so they can get a decent retail push.

Areas where I'm negative are the actual devices themselves, they don't really have a unique selling point. That, and the Android app compatibility is (as I predicted it would be) a fucking mess. Reviews say that its slow, foreign, and undesirable. Sure it help inflate app numbers and it brings apps to the platform much quicker, but the cost is user experience.

I'm not sure that users will penalize BlackBerry less because they have a slow, gl

Studios read 100 a week and make 12 a year. A lot more scripts get bought but get lost. Hollywood buys a lot of books. So you can write a screenplay or a book—and there’s a lot to be said for this. If you write your own book you’re your own boss. No rules in books. Lots of rules in screenplays. Majority of movies are based on preexisting material. Writing screenplays are important because they’re closer to production and also about voice—screenplays are all about your voice as a writer. You can write really bizarre indie scripts and get plucked to do blockbuster films—Rian Johnson, who’s doing the next two Star Wars movies—did Looper and Brick. They just want to know that you can write—they’re not genre specific. What’s important is that you write in a good voice and have good structure.

Producing:

Producer Skill Sets:

Creative—good notes on scripts etc; came up the ranks at studios

Packaging—get directors and actors and attach them to a project; former agents

Finance/Money (who knows where they got their money)

Nuts and Bolts/Line Producer/UPM—physically know how to actually produce a movie-know what a C Stand is.

Power—actors and directors (whoever becomes famous)

YOU DO NOT NEED TO HAVE ALL OF THESE THINGS.

Ideally you have two or three.

Who’s the least important?

Nuts and Bolts.

Why?

You can hire people to make a movie, but all the other things you can’t hire.

Far more important that you have access to a good script or book or a good relationship with an actor.

The Industry: High School with Money

Be nice to all assistants because they’re the next VP of Paramount.

Hollywood’s the last vocational town. No one cares about your degree in these companies. Having an MFA tells people that you care and are passionate about what you’re doing. An MFA degree isn’t gonna get you a job but it’s building the personal relationships that counts.

Speaking of personal relationships here’s Sebastian’s spiel:

Some of you will be successful and some of you will be less successful—it

Promiscuous species are those in which pair bonds do not form and males and females are likely to copulate with more than one individual of the opposite sex. It is a unique system because subordinate males have the opportunity to access females and male reproductive success is a function of post-copulatory strategies such as sperm competition and cryptic female choice. For example, when brown headed cowbirds live in areas with abundant resources, territorial lines are not well defined and promiscuity is often reported. The brown headed cowbird is a nest parasite that lays its eggs in other birds’ nests and provides no parental care for its young. Promiscuity may be the obvious choice given the birds’ behaviors and their lack of parental care.

A violent but evolutionarily effective mating strategy has been spotted in spiders from Israel. Males of the aptly-named Harpactea sadistica species pierce the abdomen of females, fertilising their eggs directly in the ovaries. This has been described as a "traumatic insemination strategy," in which insemination wounds are created by male genitalia in areas outside the genital orifice of females. It is practiced because it gives the first male a reproductive advantage by bypassing structures in the females' genitalia.

These tactics have been observed in insects such as mites, bedbugs, and flies, but this study was the first time that it was documented in spiders. Typically, spider males deliver their genetic package via sperm that manually inserted using a pair of appendages called pedipalps.

The sperm are then held in a receptacle between the ovipore and ovary known as a spermatheca until an egg is released. However, the spermatheca is a "last in, first out" structure, so that if any further males inseminate a female, the last mate's sperm is the first in line to fertilize an egg.

Milan Rezic, an entomologist at the Crop Research Institute in Prague, has spotted a spider circumventing this problem by delivering sperm directly to the ovaries via holes that the males bore directly in the females' abdomens. The male possesses a pair of emboli, appendages modified for piercing females.

The way in which the male H. sadistica inseminates the female is choreographed and complex. The male taps the female, subdues her, and wraps himself around her to properly position the sex organs. He then alternates

Today, for instance, ICANN is shaking up the web with a plan that's been a decade in the making: adding thousands of new top level domains beyond the original ones (.xxx, .google, .museum, and so on now join domains like .com, .edu, .gov), driving a new Internet land grab. This led to widespread criticism, including from the U.S. government, which has warned ICANN about the group's apparent conflicts of interest. Still, when the UN tried to take control over some of ICANN's jurisdiction earlier this year, the U.S. made sure that it didn't happen.

With that in mind, it's pretty understandable, then, that some countries want more of a say. It's as if they're trying to get a fair chance in a soccer game, when the U.S. both owns the stadium, pays the referees' paychecks and also wrote the rulebook. This is also precisely why organizations like the UN exist. Sure, the U.S. is a big stakeholder on the web with one of the biggest Internet-connected populations in the world. But Asia still makes up over half of the world's population of Internet users, and they've never really gotten a say in how it's run. Many countries argue that the shifted balance of interest in the Internet is a strong argument for UN intervention. Another reason: some countries see incidents like the Stuxnet virus, thought to have been developed at least partially in the U.S., as evidence of the risks that come with uniltateral Internet oversight in the age of cyberwar.

Meanwhile, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), which organized WCIT-12, has been trying hard not to take sides. After the world's nations failed to ratify the treaty, ITU secretary general Hamadoun Toure said that the treaty would bring the signatories "increased transparency in international mobile roaming charges and competition," even if there's still no way to enforce the treaty. Even U.S. Ambassador Terry Kramer, the head of the U.S. delegation, noted that countries can already enact Internet regulations within their own borders, and they do. “If someone wants to, that’s their prerogative, but we’re hoping that’s not an easy task,” he said on a conference call. "History will show that the conference has achieved something extremely important," continued Toure, ever the optimist. "It has

Although she is not a minister, Mrs Trevelyan is a staunch Brexiteer who said she could not support the draft deal because the negotiations have been built on "the UK trying to appease the EU".

Mrs Trevelyan, who protested for fishermen with Nigel Farage on a boat in the Thames, said the deal would prevent the UK "from independently negotiating access and quota shares" for fishing.

In her absence, he also fears for his own sanity. He decides to fix their bedroom fan—it only worked on the highest setting and was missing the face of its cage—after hearing a story about a man sticking his penis into a fan and letting the blade chop it up. The reader is led to wonder, Was Bud really worried about sticking his own penis into a fan? Doesn’t matter—he fixed the fan so it’s a non-issue, but these are the darker moments that bring a nice depth to the writing and make the reader wonder more about the inner workings of Smith’s brain based on the surface-level actions we’re presented with.

The book is filled with drawings from Rae Buleri, Bud Smith’s wife, and presumably the focus of his writing in Dust Bunny City. This partnership again reinforces the bond they have as a couple. The drawings reminded me of Shel Silverstein which added a level of whimsy to the poems I don’t think would have been apparent without them. The drawings levity also connect the poems to the relationship enough to avoid a self-deprecating tone that could have potentially made the writing collapse upon itself.

In the end, this is a book about optimizing life with your perfect partner. Though it’s not a codependent relationship, because when his wife gets the job opportunity, he tells her to go without hesitation, and when he gets called into work, she doesn’t try to stop him. They are both individuals that know what the other person needs and will step aside if they aren’t able to provide that for them—companionship at its finest. Smith knows himself and is comfortable enough laying out his relationship for us all to see.

One of the last poems, “Reunion Featuring Tulip Tree,” he and his wife look across the street and remark about how a man “is looking up at the sky / and singing himself a song at that sky / he seems to be doing fine / he is out of his mind, all of his problems / are invisible in the daylight.” Bud Smith has shown us his own daylight problems in Dust Bunny City and, by extension, made me want to show mine too.

Abstract

Computer vision can be understood as the ability to perform 'inference' on image data. Breakthroughs in computer vision technology are often marked by advances in inference techniques, as even the model design is often dictated by the complexity of inference in them. This thesis proposes learning based inference schemes and demonstrates applications in computer vision. We propose techniques for inference in both generative and discriminative computer vision models.
Despite their intuitive appeal, the use of generative models in vision is hampered by the difficulty of posterior inference, which is often too complex or too slow to be practical. We propose techniques for improving inference in two widely used techniques: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and message-passing inference. Our inference strategy is to learn separate discriminative models that assist Bayesian inference in a generative model. Experiments on a range of generative vision models show that the proposed techniques accelerate the inference process and/or converge to better solutions.
A main complication in the design of discriminative models is the inclusion of prior knowledge in a principled way. For better inference in discriminative models, we propose techniques that modify the original model itself, as inference is simple evaluation of the model. We concentrate on convolutional neural network (CNN) models and propose a generalization of standard spatial convolutions, which are the basic building blocks of CNN architectures, to bilateral convolutions. First, we generalize the existing use of bilateral filters and then propose new neural network architectures with learnable
bilateral filters, which we call `Bilateral Neural Networks'. We show how the bilateral filtering modules can be used for modifying existing CNN architectures for better image segmentation and propose a neural network approach for temporal information propagation in videos. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the proposed bilateral networks on a wide range of vision tasks and datasets.
In summary, we propose learning based techniques for better inference in several computer vision models ranging from inverse graphics to freely parameterized neural networks. In generative vision models, our inference techniques alleviate some of the crucial hurdles in Bayesian posterior inference, paving new ways for the use of model based machine learning in vision. In discriminative CNN models, the proposed filter generalizations aid in the design of new neural network architectures that can handle sparse high-dimensional data as well as provide a way for incorporating prior knowledge into CNNs.

grep is a handy tool and I use it every day. But sometimes I wish it had some more features. For instance full featured Perl compatible regular expressions (PCRE) since the current implementation is not complete and I think it will never be, automatic recursive search, exclusion of non-text files etc.

Here a tool called ack comes into play. It's a search tool and grep replacement written in Perl, which is able to do all these things. Guess what!

Adobe Flash has ever been a great source of anger due to many bugs (see here for example) and security vulnerabilities. Anyhow, it has evolved into a widely used technology and many, many websites need it to function correctly (yeah, HTML5 is coming, let's hope it will replace Flash in many places in the near future).

Adobe's bug fixing behavior has never been great and we all know, that Flash for Linux has been permanent beta (or alpha) since we can remember, but enough is enough. There is a severe bug that has now existed for three years, reported by hundreds of users. Adobe closed this report without taking action. Now it has been reported again and I want you to vote for it. Please!

When you freshly set up a Linux distribution by hand, you get a lot of verbose output when booting into your system, but also install'n'go distributions like Ubuntu oder SUSE output some text when loading the kernel. This is not always desired and many people want to suppress these insistent system messages, but it's not as easy as you might think.

The UNIX philosophy is based on the DRY principle which declares: “Don't repeat yourself”. Therefore, a program just does what it's made for and uses libraries or even other programs on your system to do a more advanced job. Some of these auxiliary programs are user definable and probably you already know the EDITOR environment variable, which specifies your default editor for the console. This is used, e.g., for the command visudo, which opens your /etc/sudoers file safely, or by svn to input a commit comment. But another important component is your console pager, which is used to display textual content on the console.

Imagine being an unsuspecting delinquent, opening Slaughterhouse-Five or The Children’s Crusade: A Duty-Dance with Death for the first time: I was blown away by how psychedelic it was. Vonnegut’s prose was irreverent, ridiculous, and, above all, courageous. Vonnegut plunged blindly into the abyss of existential uncertainty and danced in the darkness. One of the most imaginative novels ever written with a minimalist style—Slaughterhouse-Five felt like Vonnegut knew a hell of a lot more about the world and grammar than me and was choosing words that I could understand. Maybe there was nothing to understand? It was pretty damn cool. Vonnegut made literature cool—especially for a kid in detention.

In the introduction to Slaughterhouse-Five, Vonnegut explains how he had been trying to write about the firebombing of Dresden during World War II ever since his imprisonment there. This is the reason that Slaughterhouse’s protagonist, Billy Pilgrim, was also in Dresden during the bombing. Billy’s story is an interesting one—the narrative of his life involves just as much love, humor, and tragedy as anything you could probably imagine. What makes it uber unique is that Billy acquires a certain amount of objectivity similar to the reader’s own. Billy is “unstuck” in time as he has no control over where and when in his life he might be at any given moment. One moment, Billy could be at his daughter’s wedding—the next, fornicating with a movie star. It’s all very non-linear. This ability is supposedly a side-effect of his Tralfamadorian kidnapping; extraterrestrial beings teach Billy to see time in a very Matthew McConaughey-like (Interstellar) way. All moments are permanent, always happening, forever. Billy is most definitely an unreliable narrator throughout, and Slaughterhouse-Five‘s chaos can undoubtedly be interpreted in a variety of ways. All I knew at that time was that I needed more Vonnegut.

Typography

The font for this sci-fi novel is instantly setting the mood, but still totally legible. Book cover by B&J for Red Planet.

The fonts you select communicate more than the words they spell out, so choose based on the content and tone you’re aiming for. Don’t get so creative with fonts that your title and other information is tricky to read. Set the right mood with your font; choose a more flowing font to suggest romance, a whimsical font for humor, and a bold, strong font to create a sense of drama or adventure.

Title

Think like a reader, not as the author. Aim for clarity, not cleverness. Your title is the first (and sometimes the only) thing people read. Does it communicate what the book is about visually? Your goal is to use visual elements and design to show potential readers what the book is about and create a feeling in them that gives them a sense of what reading the book will be like.

This book cover for The Girl on the Train immediately conjures up a sense of mystery and lets you know you’re in for a thrilling page-turner. The blurriness of the typeface may just be the motion of the train—or it could be something more enigmatic about the girl and the story itself. Consider how you can use typography, color, and graphics to create this kind of communicative imagery for your book cover.

Subtitle

Use a subtitle only if it is needed to clarify or elaborate on your book’s topic. Ideally your subtitle compliments the title and adds additional descriptive detail. If it makes sense—and especially if you’re going to be epublishing—include any searchable keywords that are not in your title.

As a supporter of
Spay/Neuter and Release Programs, I was a little miffed that the rational
behind the new law was, in part, the number of songbirds “murdered” annually
in Wisconsin by feline vagabonds. Obviously, a hungry cat will find a
way to eat something on the food chain, and songbirds must be a tasty
delicacy to feral cats. Of course, there are natural and mechanized predators
of cats, i.e., the fisher cat, and the coyote, to name just two, and the
automobile or assault rifle . . . but I guess there’s a shortage of the
natural kind in Wisconsin.

Not to worry. When
it comes to various life forms, Americans have adopted the abortion and
death-with-dignity mantras of “disposability.” In fact, it started with
animals. If it’s too plentiful, annoying, inconvenient, too much trouble
to deal with, or sickly, it gets killed. (Next year, the residents of
Wisconsin will complain about the over-population of songbirds, bird droppings
on cars, the diseases birds carry, or the noise pollution they produce.)

It was Wisconsin’s
hunters who demanded the demise of feral cats because they’re doing what
comes naturally—hunting for their food. Evidently, they cut into the hunters’
prey—the stuff that can’t be bought at the local Piggly Wiggly, A & P,
or Wal-Mart. Please don’t get me wrong. Hunting is a sport that’s good
outdoor fun, keeps us well armed as citizens, and preserves specific groups
of animals in the wild (except feral cats who no one wants to preserve).
By the same token, cats control the rodent and bug populations.

The cat haters were
also in on passage of the new law. Cats carry horrible diseases, they
claimed. It’s true. Cats can transmit cat fever, which is no laughing
matter, and cat scratches and bites can be quite serious if not treated
immediately. Of course, anyone who goes near a feral cat without an updated
tetanus shot, protective gloves, and a large towel for wrapping the animal
so it feels secure is either nuts or ignorant. A wild animal will not

OCTOBER

Oct. 5: The fourth time is the charm. Bradley Cooper stars in and directed this fourth version of “A Star Is Born.” He plays Jackson Maine, a famous but troubled singer who discovers and mentors the talented but shy Ally (Lady Gaga). Her star rises, his drops and, well, you know, a tragic love story ensues . The terrific Tom Hardy (“The Revenant,” “Dunkirk”) stars in “Venom.” Hardy’s Eddie Brock acquires the powers of an alien symbiote, and is forced to unleash his vicious alter ego in order to save his life.

Oct. 12: The story of astronaut Neil Armstrong and his remarkable accomplishments in space are explored in “First Man,” with Ryan Gosling playing the Ohio native who landed on the moon in 1969. Gosling reteams with director Damien Chazelle (“La La Land”), and the strong cast also features Claire Foy, Kyle Chandler and Jason Clarke . Robert Redford has said “The Old Man & the Gun” will be his farewell to acting. It is based on the true story of serial bank robber Forrest Tucker, who kept up his larcenous ways well into his 70s . A confluence of weird, dark and desperate characters find themselves at a rundown Lake Tahoe hotel for one crazy night in “Bad Times at the El Royale.” Chris Hemsworth, Dakota Johnson, Jon Hamm and Jeff Bridges star.

Oct. 19: There have been so many “Halloween”s (not to mention “Nightmare on Elm Street”s, “Friday the 13th”s, etc.) that it’s hard to believe the original with Jamie Lee Curtis debuted in 1978. That makes the new “Halloween” a tidy, 40-year cycle for Curtis, who returns as Laurie Strode to battle Michael Myers in a “final confrontation.” Don’t believe the “final” part . Race, cops and class collide

And when we are at it, endman and his countless alter egos (BSDSucksDick, kraftman, CthuIhux (not Cthulhux) and the like) also belong on the list.
But anyways, I had already a conversation with one of the mods about banning the trolls and he said that they were working on a solution. But this was a few months ago and still nothing happened.

Well I suppose the easiest thing would be to clean up comments that are off topic. BSD gets something (anything) and it turns into BSD bashing. The Mir/Wayland debate.. not sure I should use that word.. also seem to veer off topic into canonical this or that.

So if there was a mod that could temp ban people for posting off topic flame bait that would go a long way IMO.

I would also like to see people citing things instead of asspulling every "truth"... that maybe too much to ask for..

Oh and I am against the karma system giving the virtually nonexistent maturity on the Internet period... let alone around these parts.

This is funny. There are people who are really off-scale, like BO$$, because they always choose random position with sole goal of trolling.
Then, there are people who clearly have zero relation to anything Linux (topic of this project) because they are here to ignite flamewars, tossing occasional windows/anti-gpl superiority or randomly picking accusations/deficiencies of Linux for the sole goal of flaming, derailing, hate-posting - like Sonadow, zester(to major degree).

Finally, there are people who have own position, that may not always have sound position, but their position is justified and never changes, that is kraftman, elanthis, dee and co. While they do ignite flamewars and may have very contrast tastes, it happens only when people above provoke them and they retreat if the matter is settled or cleared, and they do post insightful comments or facts. They nearly always get labeled as trolls by those who have been trashing

Ive never watched any Hentai (porn) anime, but some of those i have seen have had a sex scene or two in them, but they never last over a muinet, just enough that you know it happened for story progression.

There are plenty without any such thing though as well, plenty of VERY good ones of any genre, comedy, action, horror, romance, ect.

Minister for Tourism and Major Events, Kate Jones, said the return of the NRL Brisbane Doubleheader in 2017 was a score for Queensland and for fans.

“Following a sell-out event last year, this is sure to be another blockbuster sporting experience for fans and a great opportunity to enjoy a weekend in Queensland,” Ms Jones said.

“Hosting major sporting events like this plays a crucial part in growing Brisbane’s $6.3 billion tourism economy and generating local jobs.

"Last year’s event delivered more than 41,000 visitor nights and injected around $8.13 million into the local economy."

NRL Head of Football, Brian Canavan said the Doubleheader at Suncorp Stadium was a real highlight in 2016 and will no doubt be a success again in 2017.

“The fact that this year’s double header coincides with Indigenous Round will ensure it is a truly special occasion.

“The four Clubs who will be playing should be commended for supporting the concept,” Mr. Canavan said.

Manly Warringah CEO, Tim Cleary said the Sea Eagles were proud to play a home game again at Suncorp Stadium.

“The Sea Eagles have a very big following throughout Queensland and I am sure our supporters will again turn out for the Doubleheader like they did last year,’’ Mr. Cleary said.

“To play a home game as part of the Indigenous Round at Suncorp Stadium will be very special not only for our players but also for our supporters. It should be another great night of Rugby League.”

Melbourne Storm CEO, Dave Donaghy said the Doubleheader had become the marquee date of the home and away season and as a Club, couldn’t wait to be a part of it again.

“More than 52,000 fans turned up last year to witness our thrilling win over the Cowboys and we look forward to taking on the Titans this time around in front of yet another electric atmosphere.

“Some of the greatest players to ever represent Queensland will also be on show, making this the showpiece event of Indigenous Round,” Mr. Donaghy said.

Suncorp Stadium General Manager, Alan Graham said previous double headers had attracted big crowds with the concept winning the support of fans and clubs.

“We couldn’t host this event without the support of the NRL, TEQ, Brisbane Marketing the participating clubs, Fox Sports and the

“This is arguably the most significant collection ever offered in Barrett-Jackson history,” said Craig Jackson, Chairman and CEO of Barrett-Jackson. “We are so privileged to be given this opportunity to showcase Ron Pratte’s unparalleled offering.”

Ron Pratte is the founder and former CEO of Pratte Development Company, Inc., one of the biggest wood framing and concrete foundation companies in the United States. Pratte sold the company to Pulte homes at the peak of the housing boom in Arizona and cashed out before the housing market crashed. His collection is not open to the public and being intensely private Pratte avoids most media contact and requests for interviews. He does open the collection occasionally for the benefit of charity.

As more details become available Barrett-Jackson will keep enthusiasts updated on their site www.Barrett-Jackson.com

Here’s a previous feature of Pratte’s collection from the 2012 Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale auction:

Considering how good tonight was and that PS2 doesn't cause my graphics card to melt anymore I'll certainly be back for more!

we were so damn close, but we couldn't contain the TR in the end (after we had lost tawrich). holding off two factions at once is bloody hard, but i reckon that us moving to the east directly after peris could have been a better move. we just acted a little too slow and allowed em too much territory last night.

"Quantacat's name is still recognised even if he watches on with detached eyes like Peter Molyneux over a cube in 3D space, staring at it with tears in his eyes, softly whispering... Someday they'll get it."

Holding off two factions at once is bloody hard, but i reckon that us moving to the east directly after peris could have been a better move. we just acted a little too slow and allowed em too much territory last night.

Agree, think we underestimated the size of the TR push (we did have other outfits moving to contain them if I remember correctly). But it also seemed like we just didn't have enough organised VS troops left on after the NC starting warping in from Esamir.

We were closer than ever before tonight! TR was down to 1 territory, NC was down to 2. Then the TR decided to redeploy to Indar and our pop advantage melted away. Alas ... we're getting closer and closer.

Yeah, you did an amazing job with that Grible. Purple giraffe for you.

Yeah, that was good fun. Never kept a Galaxy alive for that long before. Also, another purple giraffe for Qazz who took over for a good assault on the Crown, that actually succeeded after some 30-40 minutes of heavy fighting.

It was much more enjoyable playing on indar yesterday than the day before. They must've fixed the lag issues with heals/repairs/etc.
(Also, slightly off-topic: what is up with purple giraffes, by the way? A google search turns up thousands of purple giraffes, and half of them seem to be from our bloody forums!)

in a massive show of cowardice and treachery, TR forces (mostly brtd) of roughly 100 people ghostcapped indar tonight. resistance was unfortunately futile, as TR had a continent pop of ~70%. we initially managed to ghost cap

Wokingham Borough Council is working in partnership with the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) to significantly improve the current nine outdoor court tennis facilities with the addition of three new courts.

Modern floodlights, that avoid light pollution, will also be installed to six courts and a new clubhouse is being built thanks to funding by the borough council and LTA.

Work is already well underway and includes the installation of an electronic court access system linked to online court booking, which will provide easy access and affordable tennis for the community.

A tennis operator will manage the tennis court facilities, deliver an exciting and varied programme of tennis activities for all ages and abilities, drive the sale of the pay and play activities and membership sales all year round. The cost of a family membership will be £65 per year – for all family members to play (excluding floodlighting). People will be able to purchase refreshments from the new clubhouse.

The improvements are being funded by S106 developer contributions and the LTA.

The borough council has previously worked with the LTA to improve opportunities to play tennis in the Wokingham Borough and increase the number of people taking part in the sport. Last year Cantley Park hosted two Great British Tennis Weekends which included free tennis sessions and people also had the opportunity to have their photo taken with the Davis Cup as part of the National Trophy Tour organised by the LTA.

Cllr Angus Ross, executive member for environment, said: “We’re delighted to be able to improve the tennis facilities in Wokingham Borough in partnership once again with the Lawn Tennis Association. This investment means that we can provide excellent tennis facilities for all our residents in the Wokingham Borough. Tennis is a fantastic sport and is a great way for people of all ages and abilities to stay fit and healthy.

“We appreciate there may be some local concerns about these tennis facility improvements at Cantley Park. However I’d like to reassure you there is plenty of open space at Cantley Park for everyone to enjoy whether you are a walker, jogger or our walking your dog. The new facilities are located on a small area of the park.”

Leo Tutt, LTA regional tennis participation manager, said: “We are delighted to be working in partnership with Wokingham Borough Council on this very exciting community tennis project. The enhanced facilities will provide new year-round tennis playing opportunities for the whole community, encouraging

I love punkrock and metal. That's why my character Noah Milano listens to it and Lenny Parker is a roadie. I love the surfer setting in crime novels, ever since shows like High Tide on TV and the Dawn Patrol book. How cool is it when a writer combines the love of punkrock and surfing and combines it into a PI novel? THIS cool!
Greg Salems used to play in a punkband, Bad Citizen Corporation and became a cop. When he is being investigated for a shooting one of his friends gets killed. He sets out to investigate, delving into is own past as well as that of the victim.
There's some awesome scenes in this book, like the exciting climax that is made for Hollywood and the fantastic scene in a punkrock club that made feel like I was there. I've been to a lot of punkrock shows and that scene described the sounds, the sights AND the feelings perfectly.
The feelings of Greg are written in a very compelling way and the book is as much about a punkrocker in his forties as much as a about a murder mystery. What is so well-done is that one never takes a backseat to the other. If you love crime novels or literary fiction about musicians you need to pick up this book.

You all know Dexter, tight? The serial killer targetting serial killers. If you haven't read the books you will have seen the TV show. What you might not know is that Dexter's creator published a less succesful book in the nineties, featuring fisherman / ex-cop Billy Knight. This is a reprint of that book.
Billy Knight lives in Key West, he moved there after his family got killed in LA. When an old friend from the force asks his help, trying to find out who killed his son during the LA riots Billy isn't planning to help him. He just doesn't want to face the demons he left behind there.
When something happens to his friend he decides to go to LA anyway and investigate. There he falls in love and faces an almost superhuman foe.
There are some pretty good action scenes in this book and Billy is a real knight in tarnished armour, carrying around some deep trauma. The kind of damaged, but tough character that makes for the best protagonist in (unofficial) PI novels.
The good news is that Jeff Lindsay followed up this one with a totally new book

If I had a nickle for every pediatrician, L&D nurse, or mom friend that recommended petroleum jelly for one thing or another, I’d be a rich woman. Petroleum jelly (aka Vaseline) comes from oil (one of those fossil fuel things). As Melissa Breyer, editor of Healthy Living, recounts, it was discovered by a chemist that noticed the residue left on oil drilling rigs. This goop, called “rod wax,” he then distilled to petrolatum. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are common contaminents in petrolatum and are linked to cancer by many sources, including the EPA. In addition, different (and unregulated) manufacturing processes render what consumers know as petroleum jelly harmful in myriad ways. Fragrance, artificial color, preservatives, parabens and other chemicals are added to Vaseline/petroleum jelly to affect consistency, skin absorbtion, smell and shelf-life.

“But my jar just says 100% ‘petroleum jelly’.”

That’s right, you won’t find these red flag ingredients on the package. Thanks to the lack of regulation of cosmetics and products in the US, they are not required to list all ingredients. See the actual contents of standard Vaseline (Unilever) here, thanks to EWG Skin Deep testing. These additives have been shown to cause cancer, developmental/reproductive toxicity, organ system toxicity (non-reproductive), biochemical and cellular level changes, allergies and other skin irritations.

Under the circumstances, it’s quite disturbing that Tyra Banks started a “Vaseline Frenzy” when she told the world it was her #1 beauty secret and that teens are being advised that Vaseline is their best friend. Add this to the 16 (on average) other toxic beauty and skin products people use on a daily basis and it’s not hard to see why we have sky rocketing infertility, cancer, and allergy rates, in additional to a significant increase in many behavioral disorders. (That’s another topic entirely but check out this simple list of toxins affecting learning and behavior in children from the Healthy Children Project.)

So please, do not slather this on your baby’s butt to prevent diaper rash (this doesn’t work anyway because you’re most likely trapping moisture in if you just used a wipe, which causes … wait for it … diaper rash). Note that popular products like Desitin contain petrolatum

Ning Xi thought for a moment, but decided to tell the truth: “Zhizhi sister, the thing is, I met brother Jiang when we were in school abroad, and that time…… we did date for a period of time, but after a few days we broke up, and we are purely just very good friends! I know that I should have let you know such important things earlier, but initially I mistook you as Jiang Muye’s ex-girlfriend, so I was afraid it would be awkward if I said it, so that’s why I did not say it……”

“Then, we should discuss how to settle this matter now.” After explaining the misunderstanding, Lin Zhizhi started to talk about the serious matter. “Previously, Jiang Muye’s fans disliked you, but that was caused by malicious guidance. Right now, their attitudes have a big change, and most of them have become your CP fans.

That is why, I have discussed it with Brother Ming. You can be ambiguous when you are facing the reporters or making a statement outside. You don’t have to deny it too thoroughly, just say that the two of you are in the same company, your personality can get along well, admire each other and are currently very good friends. Let the fans have some space to imagine further.”

Ning Xi stared at him and snappishly said, “Kissing scene! Don’t tell me that you have not read the script once ever since it had been modified! If I was Brother Ming, I would beat you up at least eight hundred times a day!”

Lin Zhizhi already knew their relationship anyway so Ning Xi don’t have to act so respectfully to Jiang Muye anymore.

Jiang Muye said in sarcasm, “Tsk, didn’t you know that the higher-ups want to air it during summer, and that because there are too many underaged audience, thus it made the scriptwriter delete all the bed and kissing scenes, so where do you find the kissing scene?”

“Yeah the scenes got deleted, but there were still a bit right? The scene of the first kiss,and the bed scene inside the military tent. Even though the kissing scene was forced to stop because of the hail previously, but the director said the front part could still be used, so we just have to retake the kissing part!”

“Alright, noted……” Jiang

Rival Kingdoms Age Of Ruin MOD APK is a strategy online game. this is a new title that is very similar to some recitation clash of clans and other similar titles by it does have is own defense says tried to differentiate up now from crash across the south initially where you go into the game does a million somalis as that be the same and there is also the Baraks odd stronghold is like how hollow and there’s a couple of bob a sense rest emits similar like goal smelter and is like all my and I decide to a pothole is like IP Cam but as you can see a tease apart a listener is actually a cam site for the troops to actually hang out so said she took honey pot signs of the troops to come in and of course there is a the goal story should has actually like the casual craze and there is space awash power he stay all action on call it is across both some sort of us crossbow animation and a sis a spell power guess I’ll use that power and of course there is the builder hots okay so the similarity a site days many different says the first east let’s take a look on the mechanics and if you know a stereotype possum out the Ottoman where you care to destroy.

Pros:
1. You can move multiple buildings quickly in a few taps.
2. There are multiple “heroes” call Ancient that can be upgraded like RPG game with items collect during the war
3. There is an option to battle in “Kingdom” with fellow allies
4. Able to fast forward during a battle
5. No need to wait for troops to be trained to attack next battle
6. Tournament for individual PVP battle
7. The graphics looks stunning

Cons:
1. Obvious “speed up for free” subconscious training people to use the diamonds more often.
2. The artificial intelligence sometimes is a little bit weird, e.g. drag & drop highlighted a building as nearest to attack but sometimes it will attack another building instead.
3. One of the ancient is not a deployable hero? Not sure…that will be pretty boring haha.
4. Builders cost too much diamonds?
5. The small lag after a battle win to show the celebratory shouts by troops can probably be eliminated.
Overall, this game is very playable and can be interesting what the developer can improve next.

Something quite odd is going on with media coverage of this war. Critics on all sides of the political equation have historically attacked the media for bias in one direction or another, but rarely were willing to admit that they were doing so on behalf of biases of their own. Weekly Standard executive editor Fred Barnes did just that, however, in a recent cover story celebrating top journalists' willingness to throw the old objectivity rulebook out the window as a result of the attacks of September 11.

Barnes does not have all his facts straight. He seems to think that the media have reached a new low in the eyes of the public. In fact, a recent study by the Pew Research Center demonstrates that just the opposite is true; 77 percent of those surveyed rate the media's coverage as excellent or good. Barnes also calls Geraldo Rivera a "liberal media icon" when, in fact, he is a "liberal media" joke.

Nevertheless, Barnes is quite understandably excited about Dan Rather's post-9/11 appearance on the David Letterman show, when the anchor declared: "Wherever [the President] wants me to line up, just tell me where. And he'll make the call." Given that Presidents routinely lie about matters of war and peace, Rather is volunteering here to be a mindless propagandist rather than a thinking journalist. Rather also explained to Letterman that the terrorists attacked us because they

Lotus watched it happen, she watched Micheal die, in the hands of his mother, Bellatrix Le'strange, she killed her only son, to make the dark one happy, to get her.Lotus was guilty for murder, even though it was not her full fault, she had saved Micheal, from the oath of Living Death.

Ever since this accident, Lotus was beaten, bruised, hit, by the authorities, tortured for the crimes of the one crying in their last breath, murder. But this was only the smallest pain she had ever felt, more pain comes when she felt it coming back.

She had nowhere to go, nothing to feel, but only for people to see, the scars of her guilty crimes, the one she did not commit, as she turned eleven, the scars burnt her back, but strange things happened to the ones she hated, they would fall, feel pain, and torture themselves, as if by MAGIC.

A letter came in, from a school, saying that her application had been denied, for a strange reason. No control, but her denied application, was keeping her locked away, from her true nature.

But why she was rejected was truly a mystery, as nobody, a witch nor wizard, had ever been rejected into the art of learning and controlling magic, but like I said, it was a complete mystery. There was it one reason, to keep the school safe from those, of Living Death.

The Death Eaters were coming, she sensed it in her scars, but she was locked away from other children, were she was starved, locked away, given only a piece of bread a day, and some tomatoes soup if she was lucky. She couldn't warn anyone, and she couldn't escape, the only exit was through the door, there was bars on the window, and the door was locked. While it was like this, everyone was dead...

And no one could come in, not to talk, or even look at her. That night, they came, the wind howled, and the death attacked, taking two hostages, wand at the others, looking for Lotus. They didn't care for her, they only wanted to see her dead. So they led Bellatrix to me, to my room, she took me with her, in her clouded shadow form, and left, leaving only a mark on a girl's neck.

For more than 100 years, the shape and location of human settlements has been defined in large part by energy and water. Cities grew up near natural resources like hydropower, and near water for agricultural, industrial and household use.

Hard to say with precision, but Third Way, the non-partisan think tank, asked the design team at the Washington, D.C. office of Gensler & Associates, an architecture and interior design firm that specializes in sustainable projects like a complex that houses the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys. The talented designers saw a blooming desert and a cozy arctic village, an old urban mill re-purposed as an energy producer, a data center that integrates solar panels on its sprawling flat roofs, a naval base and a humming transit hub.

There's an invisible force powering and propelling our way of life.
It's all around us. You can't feel it. Smell it. Or taste it.
But it's there all the same. And if you look close enough, you can see all the amazing and wondrous things it does.
It not only powers our cities and towns.
And all the high-tech things we love.
It gives us the power to invent.
To explore.
To discover.
To create advanced technologies.
This invisible force creates jobs out of thin air.
It adds billions to our economy.
It's on even when we're not.
And stays on no matter what Mother Nature throws at it.
This invisible force takes us to the outer reaches of outer space.
And to the very depths of our oceans.
It brings us together. And it makes us better.
And most importantly, it has the power to do all this in our lifetime while barely leaving a trace.
Some people might say it's kind of unbelievable.
They wonder, what is this new power that does all these extraordinary things?

If you think that there is plenty of electricity, that the air is clean enough and that nuclear power is a just one among many options for meeting human needs, then you are probably over-focused on the United States or Western Europe. Even then, you’d be wrong.

Billions of people live in energy poverty, they write, and even those who don’t, those who live in places where there is always an electric outlet or a light switch handy, we need to unmake the last 200 years of energy history, and

One of these cases was last month’s judgement by the Constitutional Court on EOAs.

An EOA, commonly known as a garnishee, is a court order that compels a debtor’s employer to pay his or her debt from his or her salary.

“The problem that we have in South Africa is that the legislation itself was unconstitutional because under certain circumstances it allowed for these EOAs to be issued by a clerk of the court, thereby bypassing a hearing in a magistrate’s court and therefore bypassing access to justice.

“The Constitutional Court essentially confirmed the finding of the Cape High Court. But it did something quite revolutionary where the court changed the reading to make it constitutional and immediately applicable.”

The court made the ruling on Tuesday September 13.

The Constitutional Court ruled that EOAs now require judicial oversight to determine whether such an order is just and equitable and that the amount was appropriate. This judgement, said Ms Geldenhuys, was a victory for poor, working class who earned less than R3 500 a month.

Asked how she came to work on this case, Ms Geldenhuys said her firm had been approached by businesswoman Wendy Appelbaum.

One of the workers on her farm in Stellenbosch had an EOA and when she started researching it, realised it was unfair. The firm then made contact with the University of Stellenbosch Legal Aid Clinic where they found out that there were hundreds of clients in a similar position.

“When we looked at the case, (we realised) that people affected by EOAs were the working poor and had a very low income. That is a very vicious circle of debt and reckless lending. The credit provider can recoup the outstanding reckless loan via this fast track method of an EOA. We realised that it was a situation that affected not only the hundreds of cases that we saw in Stellenbosch. There were more than two million active EOAs in South Africa,” said Ms Geldenhuys. And so the case was lodged against 13 credit providers and law firm Flemix & Associates which had administered EAOs on their behalf.

Ms Geldenhuys said the pro bono unit at the firm focused on land restitution, LGBTI and discrimination cases.

She said Webber Wentzel had a history of collaborating with organisaitons like the National Resource Centre, Equal Education and the Social Justice Coalition.



I’ve started Orlistat four days ago and haven’t noticed any changes at all, not just on the weight but also on my bowler movements as I only went to the loo once, is this normal ? What should I do ? I did reduce my fat intake

WSL 2 End of Season Review: Durham

A look back at the continued improvement of the Wildcats.

In a season dominated by the south east it’s easy to overlook all the sterling work that’s been taking place in the north west, specifically at Durham’s New Ferens home.

Little movement

Having shown steady improvement over the 2014 and 2015 seasons, the Wildcats surpassed all expectations this year to shoot up from seventh to fourth, well in the promotion race until the last few matches. Having only dropped eight points at home all year, the Wildcats have simultaneously made New Ferens Park one of the hardest places to come as well as one of the friendliest, a club that prides itself on making it as accessible for fans as possible.

Doing little business in the winter window, the key for Durham was to build on a squad that was already well in sync with each other, contract extensions signed, Becky Salicki and Sarah McFadden brought in from Sunderland to be joined by Mercy Darkoah, Tyler Dodds and Emily Roberts later in the year. Anna Moorehouse, Caroline Dixon, Julie Nelson and Lauren Jordinson (over the Summer) the only players moving in the other direction. Stability key in the north west.

Consistent in the league

Getting the year off to a storming start in the FA Cup, Durham soundly beat London Bees dev squad 9-0 before seeing off WPL high-flyers Charlton Athletic only to be undone by Notts County in the fifth round. In the league the Wildcats hit the ground running, their first three matches against Sheffield, the Bees and Oxford yielded maximum points as the northern most team in WSL 2cruised up the table.

A loss to Aston Villa in Sutton Coldfield just a blip as they bounced back with another 1-0 win over Sheffield – Durham the only team in the top half of the table not to have surrendered points to Sheffield this season. In their third meeting of the year the Wildcats were forced to settle for a 2-2 draw against the Bees in Northwood before breaking for the mid-season interval.

Picking up after a poor run

The Summer didn’t start on the best footing for Durham as they suffered their first loss at home to table-toppers Yeovil before recovering well with a 3-0 win over Villa in their next match,

NINE was nominated for the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album.

Lyricist: Maury Yeston.

Adapter: Mario Fratti.

Liner Note Authors: Maury Yeston; Michael Berniker.

Recording information: 1982.

Photographers: Peter Cunningham; Gregory Heisler.

The 1981-1982 Broadway season boasted two solid musical hits: Dreamgirls, about a Supremes-like girl group, and Nine, based on Federico Fellini's celebrated film 81/2. When Tony Awards time arrived, the conservative theater types who make up the Tony voters gave Nine five awards, for best musical, score, director, featured actress, and costume designer, while Dreamgirls won six, for best book, choreographer, actor, actress, supporting actor, and lighting designer. This Solomon-like division sent the message that Dreamgirls was in essence a performance vehicle, while Nine was the more solid overall work. In retrospect, it seems that the Tony voters got it exactly backward. They may have been skittish about the pop/R&B pastiche that made up Henry Krieger and Tom Eyen's score for Dreamgirls and more comfortable with Maury Yeston's more traditional Broadway score for Nine, but the former has proven more memorable in the long run. (It was also the more popular at the time, with a cast album that went gold, produced a Top 40 hit, and won the Grammy, while Nine never reached the charts.) And though both shows had healthy runs, Dreamgirls ran more than twice as long. Actually, the strong points of Nine have more to do with the cast, led by Raul Julia as a confused Italian film director, and featuring nine women in his life, among them Karen Akers and Tony winner Liliane Montevecchi, than with what they are given to sing. Yeston's music is appropriately European-styled, and his lyrics are often facile, but little about them stands out without the performers and director Tommy Tune's staging to support them. While the score is enjoyable in the context of the show, it is not surprising that this music did not live outside the theater and that there have been relatively few revivals of the show since its original production. (In its original release, the cassette version of Nine [CBS Masterworks JST 38325] was an expanded version of the LP, running more than 80 minutes

Glazed and unglazed tile have differences in more ways than just appearance; differences include where they are installed and for what uses they are good for.

Installation for tile is considered simple but hiring a professional for installation is highly recommended to guarantee the flooring is installed correctly. Tile, when installed correctly will give you a durable and beautiful floor that when properly maintained can last for generations.

When installing ceramic tile there are steps that should be taken to ensure the installation is done correctly. One, preparing the sub-floor; this includes clearing any and all debris having a clean surface to install the ceramic tile. Two, marking the center of the room, this will be the starting point for installation. Chalk lines are a common tool used to mark the center of the room by snapping the chalk lines that intersect and laying a single row of tiles along the center, giving you the layout for the space. Three, applying the adhesive this creates a bond between the tile and the sub-floor holding the tile in place. Four will be cutting the tile to size then putting in place to be bonded with the sub-floor; to finalize the work apply grout to the joints between the tile.

How Long Will Ceramic Tile Last?

That unit was underrated overall last season, and added some very talented players in the offseason, particularly in the secondary. But pressuring the quarterback is still a huge key.

The Giants were tied for 25th in the NFL in sacks (34) last season, and team leader Justin Tuck (11) is now with the Oakland Raiders.

The team's best remaining pass-rusher is Jason Pierre-Paul, and he has been pegged by many as the key to the team's success this season on defense -- including general manager Jerry Reese.

Thus, some might view the fact that Pierre-Paul has yet to record a sack through three preseason games as a concern. But Pierre-Paul himself disagrees.

"It's not important at all," Pierre-Paul said Wednesday. "We only get 25 snaps, that's not a realistic number for me to play. ... You don't get a feel of what the offensive tackle's doing or the inside rusher. I'm not worried about sacks in the preseason. Wait a couple weeks and we'll see."

The Giants are desperately hoping for a bounce-back season from Pierre-Paul, who was fourth in the NFL with 16.5 sacks in 2011, but had just 8.5 in 2012 and 2013 combined.

Health has been an issue the past two years, but Pierre-Paul says he's not limited in any way right now.

"I'm fine," he said. "Every day I'm still working on my technique, that's with everybody too. But as far as health-wise I'm fine. I'm out there every day doing what I can."

The Giants have eight sacks total in the first three preseason games, but none from a player pegged to be a starter come Week 1.

"We've still got work to do as far as the front [four]," Pierre-Paul said. "We've got a lot of work to do. We have a couple weeks left and hopefully we'll get it right."

Later, he expressed confidence we'll see better performances once we reach the regular season.

"I know the guys will pick it up," Pierre-Paul said. "I'm not saying they do slack but come the first game you'll see a big difference in the defense and the offense."

2. Rising interest rates

Inflation is a serious threat to bull markets, but the cure can also be toxic when the Federal Reserve Board fights back with stingier monetary policies and higher interest rates. Rising rates pull money from stocks into fixed-income investments. And there’s a risk that central bankers will overshoot, choking off economic growth. When Fed chairman Paul Volcker declared war on inflation in 1979, he hiked a key short-term rate from 11% to a peak of 20% in 1981. Investors saw stock prices drop 27% in the bear market that began in 1980; by 1981, the economy was in recession.

Today: Although inflation remains minimal, the Fed, in response to a slowly improving economy, has begun unwinding its massive bond-buying program aimed at pushing long-term rates lower. And rate forecasters expect the Fed to hike short-term rates beginning in late 2015 or early 2016. Whether rising rates are the death knell to a bull market depends on timing and context, says Jim Paulsen, chief market strategist at Wells Capital Management. Are yields rising along with confidence in an improving economy? Or are they rising because the economy has reached the overheated stage and inflation is a threat? Paulsen looked at nine periods when bond yields were on the upswing but confidence was rising, too. In eight of the nine, stocks posted double-digit gains.

3. Geopolitical instability

There’s nothing like saber-rattling to rattle the stock market. The 1990 bear market began just before Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, taking the S&P down 20%. In the year following the terrorist attack on the U.S. in 2001, the S&P fell 17%.

Today: Stocks reeled in March as Russia invaded Ukraine, and the unsettled region could lead to further market upsets. But in most cases, geopolitical crises don’t bring on the bear, says Jim Stack, of InvesTech Research, who looked at the market’s reaction to 11 events ranging from Germany’s invasion of France in 1940 to Operation Iraqi Freedom, in 2003. More than half the time, the market ended the first month following the event with a decline. But in eight of 11 cases, the S&P 500 more than recovered any losses by the six-month mark. “The current Ukraine crisis doesn’t change the outlook for the market,” Stack says.

Ooooh! Eucalyptus. That's got to be slang for something kinky as all hell! Was this a social networking app for a very special subset of furries? A hook-up site for swinging Botanists? No, actually it was an Ebook app for public domain works. Since it provided access to a Victorian-era translation of the Kama Sutra, the app was deemed inappropriate. We asked Apple if they saw any irony in the fact that the iPhone's web browser provided access to a billion websites far filthier than an ancient translation of a religious text. Sadly, Apple's board of directors was too busy banning dancing in small Midwest towns to be reached.

Jilted developers and Google aren't the only people pissed off at Apple's App Store policies. The boys at the FCC are investigating the App Store for anti-competitive practices. Apple responded to the accusation, which kicked off yet another gigantic legal clusterfuck the results of which have yet to be decided, but are likely to be retarded.

#1. Apple Versus Absolutely Everyone: The Masterplan

You might be asking why any of this should matter to you. After all, most of Apple's dickery is aimed at a small, tech savvy minority. People who know how to hack their iPhones or program applications or work for a giant Apple subsidiary in China. Jobs has always known that the vast majority of people think technology is something to watch porn on. Lucky for him, he's fantastic at designing technology that those people intuitively understand how to use. Unlucky for the non-savvy majority, there are increasing signs that we're the eventual target of Apple's master plan.

If you're one of the tens of millions of people who have iTunes installed on their Windows machines, you might want to open up a search and see if Apple's "Safari" web browser has made its way onto your computer. No, you didn't download that on purpose and then forget about it. In March of 2008, Apple stuck a copy of Safari into a routine update for iTunes. They set the 22.65 MB file as part of the default download. Users who just skimmed over the update notice without reading it (IE: nearly everyone) soon found themselves with unwanted software.

Whether you want it or not.

Jianlin Wang, chairman of Dalian Wanda, which bought AMC, wants his company to reach $100 billion in revenue by 2020, up from the current level of $30 billion. While his home market China is the fastest growing movie market in the world, he'll still need overseas acquisitions to achieve his goal.

"The acquisition of AMC is just the start," says Wang, and "probably before the end of the year we may complete one or two more deals." He says he expects to spend another $7 billion in the U.S. by the end of this decade.

Wang tells CNBC that he plans acquisitions in nearly every part of the globe. By doing so, he thinks he can garner better profit-sharing agreements with Hollywood movie studios and hence higher profitability.

International Vitamin Corporation, of Freehold, N.J., came into being after a Chinese company bought the vitamin assets of Inverness Medical from private equity in 2010. CEO Steven Dai says the investors (he's one of them) have pumped "upwards of hundred millions of dollars into the company," since then-improving its IT backbone, expanding warehouse capacity, and increasing the number of employees from 280 to 400, all of them in the U.S.

Dai, the only Chinese employee, says buying an American company made the most sense because the U.S. has a highly developed, multi-billion dollar, nutritional market "which constantly grows every year."

Of the three companies that spoke to CNBC, the one with the longest history in the U.S. is China Construction of America, a wholly owned subsidiary of China State Construction Engineering Corporation (Shanghai Stock Exchange: 1668-SZ) (CSCEC) that had $500 million in revenue in 2012. (Parent company CSCEC had revenue of $92 billion last year.) Although publicly traded in Shanghai, CSCEC shares are majority owned by the Chinese government, making China Construction of America part of what's known as a State-Owned Enterprise, or SOE.

China Construction set up shop here nearly 30 years ago in 1985 because the U.S. was the world's largest construction market at the time. Why are they still doing business here, when China is now larger and growing faster? Geographic diversification, CEO Ning Yuan tells CNBC, in case the home market falters.

Question generatingreinforces the summarizing strategy
and carries the learner one more step along in the comprehension activity. When
students generate questions, they first identify the kind of information that
is significant enough to provide the substance for a question. They then pose
this information in question form and self-test to ascertain that they can
indeed answer their own question. Question generating is a flexible strategy to
the extent that students can be taught and encouraged to generate questions at
many levels. For example, some school situations require that students master
supporting detail information; others require that the students be able to
infer or apply new information from text. Question generating ini digunakan

Clarifying is an activity that is particularly

and in fact the passage, are not making sense. When the students are asked to
clarify, their attention is called to the fact that there may be many reasons
why text is difficult to understand (e.g., new vocabulary, unclear reference
words, and unfamiliar and perhaps difficult concepts). They are taught to be
alert to the effects of such impediments to comprehension and to take the
necessary measures to restore meaning (e.g., reread, ask for help).Dalam

It's not that the oil suddenly disappeared — it's still there, but it can't be removed from the ground. Unlike the relatively stable shale oil fields of North Dakota and Texas, the Monterey Shale has been folded and shattered by seismic activity, making the oil it contains inaccessible — at least by current technology.

In other words, there's not going to be a giant oil boom in California's near future, and the state, as a result, is not going to add 2.8 million new industry jobs or see its tax revenue increase by $24.6 billion annually, as oil and gas interests had claimed. In fact, there's likely not going to be a boom at all. And so, if the state were to enact a ban on fracking now, it probably would have little to no impact on California's economy. As such, there's no reason for the governor and lawmakers to continue to back a controversial practice that involves shooting massive amounts of water and toxic chemicals deep into the earth and has been linked to groundwater and air pollution and to earthquakes.

Perhaps that's why the state Senate's Appropriations Committee approved SB 1132 late last week — after the feds released their revised estimate on the Monterey Shale. The bill would implement a ban on fracking while state officials complete a comprehensive environmental review of the fossil-fuel extraction method. The legislation is now headed for a full vote by the state Senate. And there's no good reason for the legislature or the governor to now oppose it.

Indeed, they should have enacted a fracking ban in 2013. It was already clear last year that the extreme environmental hazards caused by fracking simply aren't worth the risks — even considering the potential boost to the state's economy, which still seemed possible last year. Voters have realized this fact. Last week (before the feds released their revised estimate), a poll showed that a supermajority of state residents — 68 percent — said they support a fracking moratorium. Even a majority of Republican voters — 51 percent — expressed support for a temporary ban.

In short, it's long past time for state lawmakers and the governor to catch up to the general public. California doesn't need to be fracked.

AUBURN HILLS, Mich. Nike Dunks For Sale Online . -- Al Jefferson found a groove just in time for the Charlotte Bobcats. Jefferson scored 15 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter, and the Bobcats overtook the Detroit Pistons for a 116-106 victory Friday night. Charlotte trailed by 20 in the second quarter and by 14 heading into the fourth. "I dont know what was going on in the first half," Jefferson said. "It just got to a point where Id had enough. I just had to go out there and do what I can do." Kemba Walker scored 34 points for Charlotte and Gerald Henderson added 22, but the fourth quarter belonged to Jefferson. With Detroit up 99-94, the 6-foot-10 centre scored six straight points for the games first and only lead change. Then Walker added a 3-pointer from in front of the Detroit bench to make it 103-99. Jefferson scored Charlottes next seven points on a jumper, a three-point play and a 20-footer that made it 110-102. Brandon Jennings had 26 points for Detroit, which rallied from a 21-point deficit to beat Boston on Wednesday but blew a big lead two nights later. "When Al gets into that kind of rhythm, with his offensive game, Im not sure anyone is going to stop him," Pistons coach Maurice Cheeks said. "We really struggled with their dribble penetration. That had been getting better, but they were able to get their guards to the basket too easily. After that, they just started going to Jefferson in the post and steamrolled us." Down 89-75, the Bobcats scored the first nine points of the fourth quarter to get back in the game. Charlotte ended up with 72 points in the second half and outscored the Pistons 41-17 in the final quarter. The Pistons lost despite shooting 12 of 23 from 3-point range. Charlotte won even though forward Jeff Taylor played less than a minute before going down with a right Achilles injury. Taylor left the game after only 37 seconds. He stayed down for a while after the injury to his right leg and could be heard groaning in pain before he was eventually helped off the court. Taylor is expected to undergo further testing Saturday. The Bobcats have won three straight. Jefferson equaled a season high in scoring that hed set in an overtime win over Toronto on Wednesday. "He played great tonight," Charlottes Cody Zeller said

Marvelous Carmageddon 1

Here's a short post about some C1 stuff.

Everybody playing C1 knows about the annoying effect in the windows being kinda messed up. I had a look at the reason why it happens like that. First thing is that it isn't linked to the car at all. You can define a material on your car that the game will later replace with a sky material or area material if you are in a SFX volume. Actually these materials that the game is substituing are the "problem". Most of these materials are using the env map (loc) effect, like we use in C2 for chrome etc. and these materials are also rolling by default (controlled by the car's movement). As the env map in C1 is kinda ugly (pixelated) and not working the same way as in C2, Stainless decided to multiply both horizontal and vertical repeatition by 5! This was an unknown feature of the MAT files. And apparently it doesn't go well with the env map effect. Getting rid of the repeatition also get rid of the problem but then the material in the windows are very pixelated, enabling dithering on said material doesn't help. No idea what to do to solve this so far. And fixing this would be a lot of work as C1 uses a lot of these materials all around and they don't all beheave the same way.

At least this made me discover the UV repeatition! Not really sure how useful this could actually be (besides increasing the env map material) but I understood how it works. Hexediting a MAT file you can notice for each material entry a pair of 3F80h. The C1 materials using UV repeatition had 40A0h instead. So to put it simply, 3F80h = 1 and 40A0h = 5. However the scale value isn't a constant. It's decreasing at every power of two. Let me explain: 1 is 3BF0h, to get the texture to repeat to times you must add 80h and thus write 4000h, to go from 2 to 3 however as we passed by 2 power 1 we mustn't add 80h but 40h and write 4040h, it's the same to go to 4 (and write 4080h). Again as we leave 4 which is 2 power 2 the difference must be divided by two again and we must add 20h instead. From 8, the difference will be 10

You have two choices: 1.Handle the exception as will be explained next slides 2.Or tell compiler that you are aware of this error and you want your method to be terminated when the exception occurs To declare that a method should be terminated when a checked exceptions occurs, use throws specifier so it can throw an exception public void read(String filename) throws FileNotFoundException { FileReader reader = new FileReader(filename); Scanner in = new Scanner(reader);... } −throws signals the caller of your method that it may encounter exception so caller needs to make a decision either to handle them or tell its caller that exception may be thrown. For multiple exceptions: public void read(String filename) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException Checked and Unchecked Exceptions 11

12
Every exception should be handled somewhere in your program −No exception handler: an error message is printed and your program terminates −But you would not want a professionally written program to die because of some unexpected error. −There fore you should install exception handlers for all exceptions your program might throw. Install an exception handler with try/catch statement try block contains statements that may cause an exception catch clause contains handler for an exception type Catching Exceptions 12 try {... FileReader reader = new FileReader(filename); Scanner in = new Scanner(reader);... } catch (IOException exception) { exception.printStackTrace(); } catch (NumberFormatException exception) { System.out.println("Input was not a number"); }

15
Occasionally you need to take some action whether or not an exception is thrown. Exception terminates current method Danger: Can skip over essential code −For example, it is important to close a PrintWriter to ensure that all output is written to the file, or an exception may be thrown before closing a reader filer. Example: reader = new FileReader(filename); Scanner in = new Scanner(reader); readData(in); reader.close(); // May never get here Must execute reader.close () even if exception happens Use finally clause for code that must be executed "no matter what" The finally Clause 15

16
FileReader reader = new FileReader(filename); try { Scanner in = new Scanner(reader); readData(in); } finally { reader.close(); // if an exception occurs, finally clause is // also executed before exception is passed // to its handler } The finally Clause 16 Finally clause is executed when try block is exited in

A challenge coin made to represent these duties can ring true for all of these organizations, so it’s also important to set yourself apart from the pack, whether at HQ or out in the field. Whether be it your insignia, your motto, or the design of your challenge coin, your fellow firefighter will be able to appreciate them alongside their brothers in arms.

Tradition, pedigree, loyalty and service are what firefighter challenge coins are made to represent. Being a firefighter can often mean you are thrust into a brotherhood composed of others who are dedicated to risking their lives to save people. A coin representing what a firefighter is all about can help drive the point across to others in this brotherhood, giving fire departments a chance to carry tradition into the future.

Firefighting is not only a longstanding service in the United States, but is also a brotherhood of people who both volunteer and are chosen to heed the call of duty. With responsibilities different from a soldier or medical professional, they must also go through rigorous training which only a select few pass every time. Separating the “men from the boys” does not mean machismo reigns supreme in the brotherhood of firefighters, but a friendly camaraderie typical of a close-knit brotherhood. In this regard, challenge coins are just one element of a very cohesive band of professionals.

The Firefighting Tradition

A firefighter is dedicated to protecting his fellow man in times of need. Not only do they extinguish fires, but they strive to prevent the unneeded loss of life and property to other disasters. Firefighters also serve as rescue teams in other times of disasters, such as during earthquakes, tornadoes, floods and snow storms.

I doubt if that is the reason he did not won't to visit the troops wounded in Iraq and sent to Germany for treatment. It might be the comment that the american soldiers had nothing really to do with the growing stablization in Iraq. I guess he figured all they did was take up space , kill innocent civilans and be bullies.

Good try. Every campaign trail and every state Obama went to during the primary you could see he was not the kind of person to brush people off. You are a liar and you need to stop printing these fabrications because you are either a Hillary fan of Mccain fan. nobody is falling for this, amazing what the evil mind comes up with.

Funny how all of the Army troops he shared lunch with–were junior enlisted–and the only senior staff who got close to him was Petraious?

Could this be a vote of no confidence from military NCO and Officer leadership–or just staged photo-ops by the Obama ground team?

I believe it's a no confidence vote myself. Everything he has said and done is contrary to NCO Academy education and OTS, Command/Staff Training.

So–who's right? A body of knowledge with over 200 years of history and scrutiny of non-partisan foreign policy military experts from the Revolutionary War to Afghanistan/Iraq and around the globe or Mr. Obama?

Was a Democrat-Now an Independent

Let me see if I have this right. Obama has plenty of time to have a work out before his speech,

The judges are nominated by the 10-member Judicial Merit Selection Commission, which is appointed, and hence controlled by the Legislature, then all 170 members of the Legislature vote on the nominees. Public input is limited and maybe not all that effective in the first place.

Six of the 10 members of the JMSC must be sitting members of the Legislature – three from the House and three from the Senate – and the other four don’t always seem that independent, not that it would matter much if they were. A current House appointee to the commission is John Davis Harrell, the brother of House Speaker Bobby Harrell.

To be fair, there is one additional step in South Carolina’s system. Judicial candidates must be “qualified” by the JMSC prior to nomination by the JMSC. This includes taking (and presumably passing) a test on court procedures, and surviving a background check conducted by the South Carolina Bar Association and regional citizen’s commissions appointed by the JMSC.

Various interest groups have complained about the South Carolina system in general, and about its ineffectiveness at selecting judges from certain subgroups – women, minorities, the Pee Dee – but supporters say it beats the alternative: judicial elections. Elective systems – North Carolina picks judges this way – gives the people a say, but it opens the door to any and all candidacies and other possible perversions of the selection process. Recent Supreme Court rulings relating campaign financing, say some critics, have put judicial seats up for sale. An interest group could easily “buy” a judgeship with advertising and marketing, given that most judicial campaigns aren’t well-funded and candidates struggle to gain attention on crowded ballots. A couple hundred thousand – not a big sum compared to the benefits a corporation might reap from certain rulings – could sway many races.

That tips the scales in many minds back to merit selection, but that leads back to worries about secretive “good ol’ boy” systems, like the one employed by South Carolina.

South Carolina is in the majority when it comes to judicial selection. Thirty-three of 50 states use what can generally be called the “merit” selection process. But merit systems vary and critics of the S.C. system say it is more closed than most. Other states involve the governor’s office – the governor appoints, the Legislature confirms – and still others use popular referendums for nomination or first-term recall.

South Carolina’s current system is actually

So it’s another weekend and your kid is clinging to your pants leg, begging you for money to buy that candy bar/toy/video game they’ve had their eye on. It’s something every parent experiences often before your child can even talk (no joke, my kids were pointing at the animal cracker boxes at the grocery store before the age of 2).

Recently I’ve been listening to Jay Ferruggia’s Renegade Radio podcast. Jay is a bodybuilder and trainer in NYC who talks quite a bit about the 80/20 Rule and how it applies to life in general. Today I’ll explain what it 8s and how we can view every aspect of our lives this way.

A few weeks back we had an open thread discussing the preferences between a home gym and going to a gym. Having spent a month in a conventional gym after 3 years of using a home gym, I’ll weigh in on the pros, cons and my outlook going forward.

As a father and husband you have to wear many hats. You have to be the protector, the teacher, the strong ox, the one who guides them etc. One thing I’ve also realized is how you also have to be in charge of the finances of your family and how you need to be the one who green lights all expenditures.

You hear all over the Manosphere that you should be creating side hustles to work on. The reasons for this may vary -getting out of debt, quitting your soul-sucking job, retiring early, etc.- but the underlying reason is the same.

“Children who reach the age of eighteen with their entire skills set composed on Nintendo and eating Doritos have been neglected. Their parents neglected to give them the character traits necessary to live successfully.”

The Beaker phenomenon and genetic transformation of Northwest Europe 2017

Has now examined some of these questions, through the examination of an unprecedented scale of ancient DNA sampling. The link to their published document (which is still awaiting peer review) is at the top of this post, and I'd invite others to read it for themselves. An article covering the document can also be read on the Scientific American. However, I personally with my layman head take five suggestions from the study.

They found that the DNA of human remains on Continental Europe did not suggest one cohesive or homogeneous population. There was in this case, evidence of cultural diffusion. Different peoples were taking on the Bell Beaker artifact assemblage in Western Europe. Pots rather more than people. This was a great surprise, as we still know from the earlier study, that much of our DNA and Y-DNA in particular, originated around 400 years earlier from the Eurasian Steppes. However, although the Central European Corded Ware Culture does still appear to have been a response to that great influx of new people from the Steppes, the picture with the Western European Bell Beaker is more complex.

An exception was Britain. Here, the remains associated with Bell Beaker Culture were all one population, and they were very different to the earlier Neolithic population of Britain. It appears to have been a case of population displacement. They suggest at least 90% displacement! It means that very few or none of our Neolithic ancestors built the amazing monuments of Neolithic Britain. They were built by earlier peoples, that our ancestors displaced.

They confirm a Lower Rhine origin as most likely for the British Beaker People. The ancient DNA that most closely matched British Beaker DNA, came from Beaker human remains in the Netherlands and Northern Germany. This correlates nicely with the 1970 archaeological study mentioned above.

It's confirmed. Previous to their entry into the British Isles, there is no evidence of any Steppe ancestry, no Steppe autosomal DNA, no Steppe Y haplogroups such as R1b-L21 here. (Nor any mtDNA haplogroup H6a1). The Beaker people from the Lower Rhine, brought the initial layers of this DNA to Britain. The founder population were admixed, but with significant percentages of Steppe ancestry, particularly on Y lines.

The previous Neolithic Farmer population were mainly Y haplogroup I2, and appear to have descended mainly from populations in the South, from

The IAEA will expand its monitoring of Iran’s uranium enrichment sites and other facilities under the interim accord, reached after marathon talks between Iran and the United States, France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China.

“This will include the implications for funding and staffing,” Amano told the IAEA’s 35-nation governing board, according to a copy of his speech. “This analysis will take some time. I will consult the board as soon as possible when it has been completed.”

The IAEA’s visit next month to the heavy-water production plant near the town of Arak is part of a separate agreement signed earlier this month between the Vienna-based UN agency and Iran.

The IAEA has not been at the site for about two years, despite repeated requests, but Iran agreed on November 11 to grant access to this facility, as well as to a uranium mine, within three months.

The Arak facility produces heavy water intended for use in a nearby research reactor that is under construction. The West is concerned that the reactor, which Iran has said could start up next year, could yield plutonium for bombs once it is operational. Iran says it will produce medical isotopes.

Iran has agreed to halt installation work at the reactor and to stop making fuel for it.

The Iran Nuclear Deal:Rewriting the Middle East Map

By James M. Dorsey

Synopsis

The
agreement to resolve the Iranian nuclear programme could rewrite the
political map of the Middle East and North Africa, as well as strengthen
the US pivot to Asia. It could also reintegrate Iran into the
international community as a legitimate regional power.

Commentary

IF
ALL goes well, the preliminary agreement between Iran and the five

In 1992, I was "Miss Denmark", where I was tipped to win the Miss World crown, came in the top 10 finals and a very bitter grated history, as also my past aroused the interest of the press. That same year, a journalist from the daily press suggested that I wrote a book because he thought I had experienced more than 80 years. It did not happen until I was threatened in 2008 and subject to the power of violence from our community. Their staff was even threatening when he heard that I had begun to write a book. But this was my only hope of being heard and use the pain constructively. The pain would indeed be constructive if I could make a difference for others and I could shout righteousness name up.

In connection with the publication of my book, I should also find a name for my desired website where the book among others being presented. One day when I was watching Animal Planet, there was a program for a Catwhisper and composed a book called; All cats have Asperger's syndrome, it was like a revelation to me that I spoke to were struggling, with insider insights and theoretical professional education behind it was to be Autismwhisper. After searching the web Inland and expatriate, I could see that it was not a name that appeared anywhere and therefore web addresses are not taken.

Hence came the website named Autismwhisper for I- we whisper with insider voice of an autistic world. I was alone in my Autismwhisper universe until I met my very best autistic girlfriends; Stinne & Pernille. We are a trinity. We go together like we were dealt, by the same cell. We see each other with each other's eyes. We speak the same language, the same frequency, understand the same way and have the same thinking style. Besides that we have the autistic development profile in common with the same brain style, we have the same ethos and humanist attitudes that unite us together.

It is my immense pleasure that we whisper together and we are united here too. It is not inconceivable that our children will one day make our company here and you will benefit from their insight and also comes other. We are also joined by some strong, competent and authentic conspecifics and Neuro-Typical people who we will refer to. We also provide other useful links that do not necessarily have to be authentic, they can also be useful. This will only be some we even trust. But

For and against Romania

“When I think about home, I think about Romania. I don’t live in a fantasy land with my head in the clouds. I don’t say we’re all going to be friends and live happily together forever and ever. What I am saying is that this country is wonderful, which is exactly why I decided to live here,” says Sam.

He likes people in Romania because they’re so friendly and will help you out when you need it. “A few years ago I was in Bucharest for a blind date with a woman I met online and I got turned around and lost. I stopped a group of young people and asked them to help me. They didn’t just tell me where to go and how to get there but actually came along with me to show me the way. We ended up talking and laughing and ended up hanging out all night together at a local bar,” remembers Sam.

Personal relationships are another reason why Sam likes Romanians. “If I go to the corner store that’s 3 minutes away by foot from my house, for sure I’m going to be there 20 minutes just gossiping with the neighbors. One day I went to the store and accidentally left my money at home. The store clerk knew me and told me not to worry about it and just bring the money the next day. That never happens in America,” he says.

What kind of tourism Romanians should practice

Sam believes Romanians need a new image. “When Romania is brought up, people only know about gymnastics, vampires and gypsies. Official tourist campaigns are launched year after year yet tourists still have no idea why they should come and visit Romania. They should abandon futuristic ambitious projects like Dracula Park and focus more on what can be done right now,” argues the American.

A few Romanian suggestions from Sam: “Foreigners can dance in the club until 3 am because Romania has some of the best clubs in Europe. They’ll discover very beautiful people, natural food that’s extremely delicious as well as artisan handicrafts and traditional products. Tourists would be extremely interested in learning how to sew, to carve wood, to drink tuica made at home and to ride in a wooden horse-drawn cart. Rich people would pay a fortune to get a taste of the the old traditional world that you can find here in Romania.”

Great article. I’m honestly happy you found happiness in

The players were offered Christian Orthodox crosses by the leader of the Greek church, Archbishop Christodoulos.

Thousands gathered in Athens to celebrate the team's triumph

The players had been due at the stadium at 1830 BST, but the ceremony had to be delayed by two hours as the bus carrying the team inched its way through streets thronged with people waving the country's blue and white flag.

Tens of thousands of fans lined the 25-mile route between the airport and the centre of Athens.

Earlier, the players' plane taxied through an arch of water made by two fire engines.

Rehhagel and his players, many wearing their medals, were presented with flowers and the fans cheered as they displayed the Henri Delaunay trophy.

Police had said they would ban all traffic along the route from the airport at least one hour before the plane touched down.

But it did not stop a crowd of about 1,500 people from gathering to welcome back their heroes, beating drums and singing the national anthem.

"This is the best passport, the best invitation for the Olympics, because this great Greek summer continues in one-and-a half months with the Games."

It is understood the Government is not planning a public holiday to mark the triumph.

"We have a full office working here just like any other day and I'm not aware of any plans for a public holiday," said a spokesman for the Athens 2004 organising committee.

Millions of fans had taken to the streets on Sunday night, in cars or on foot, jumping into fountains, scaling buildings and unfurling a sea of blue and white flags.

Fire trucks and police cars joined the party, parading along with the crowd through the capital.

The Greece players were lauded as soon as they arrived at the airport

The ancient Acropolis was lit by fireworks while cannons under the city's Lycabetus hill fired celebratory shots to hail Greece's 1-0 victory over Portugal, courtesy of Angelos Haristeas' header.

Radio stations on Monday played traditional syrtaki music to keep Athenians in the party spirit, and even political newspapers wore the national colours of blue-and-white around full-page pictures of the squad.

Lactobacillus, Brettanomyces and Pediococcus are notable examples of once-wild yeasts & bacteria now tamed and routinely harnessed by brewers, with Brett in particular imparting funky—sometimes fruity—barnyard-esque flavors often lovingly referred to as “horse blanket.” In moderation, these traits are desirable for their intricacies, showcasing the environmental flavors summoned from the brewery’s immediate surroundings. You may have already enjoyed the acidic tartness courtesy of Lactobacillus in our kettle-soured Berliner Weisse, A Bizarre Gardening Accident (note: Lactobacillus also gives sauerkraut and yogurt their distinct tang).

Air temperature and seasonality are also paramount to ensure the right kind of bacteria are soaked up, so our brew team jumped into action when they saw last weekend’s forecasted overnight temperatures dip into the low 40s. If brewed with undesirable bacteria borne on hot, sticky summer air they could render the beer’s funk unbearably harsh. While there is certainly an undercurrent of chaos in this manner of brewing, this timeworn technique has been used—and is still used—by notable Belgian farmhouse brewers like Cantillon to create their famed Lambics, and this uniquely unpredictable process has seen a significant resurgence in the United States.

Where did the inspiration for a coolship come from?

BobHaa, HeadBrewer: Coolships are rare here in Florida and we’ve all been interested in doing this for a while. When I visited Cantillon in 2012 (Brussels) I considered that a bucket-list trip, almost like a pilgrimage. When I was 22 years-old I was buying old, dusty bottles of Lambics from a guy in St. Petersburg who couldn’t sell them. They were so good I went back and cleared out his supply, and I’ve been inspired by wild beer styles since I started home-brewing in the late 80s. I’ve always been leery about the ramifications of doing it in a commercial brewery, but we now have a solid crew and the careful processes in place needed to make it work.

BruceBobbitt, Brewer: Buying a coolship wasn’t exactly priority number one with our production demands, so we had to think outside of the box a bit.

JoseMartinez, LeadBrewer: This whole idea started over the summer when Andrew (

CHICAGO – More than 7,000 Illinois residents signed up for private insurance coverage in the first two months of the troubled HealthCare.gov website, less than 30 percent of the federal government's projection for the state's enrollment at this point of the rollout.

Enrollment figures released Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services showed the pace picking up in the state and nationally; 364,682 Americans signed up for private coverage under President Barack Obama's new federal health law, including 7,043 in Illinois.

In October, when the website was barely working, only 1,370 Illinois residents managed to select a health plan and sign up. The new figures mean an additional 5,673 people made it through the process in November as the government scrambled to make hundreds of website repairs.

Catching up on enrollment will be challenging. The target for Illinois was to have 24,310 people signed up by the end of November, according to an internal federal memo first obtained by The Associated Press.

The state's 1,500 enrollment counselors would each need to successfully sign up more than one person every single day of this month – about nine people each week – to catch up with what had originally been projected before the website failures: 67,210 Illinois residents signed up by the end of December.

The administration had set a goal of signing up 7 million people by the end of open enrollment season March 31.

State officials said there is still plenty of time for people to enroll.

"These numbers show the federal website has improved but there is still more work to do," Jennifer Koehler, the chief of the Illinois insurance marketplace, said in an email. "A lot of people still need coverage and have been exploring their options on Getcoveredillinois.gov. We can see this from the traffic on the website and from the reports we are getting from our statewide network of community partners, who are helping consumers sort through their options and enroll every day."

Online insurance shopping is a key part of the nation's health care law. Illinois is relying on the federal website because the Legislature didn't approve a state-run marketplace.

The federal site serving 36 states, including Illinois, continues to have issues. Just Tuesday there was an extended maintenance outage. Some states running their own websites are also having problems, but in general, the state-run sites are performing better than the federal site.

We offer custom produced video effects for your attraction. Regardless of 2D or 3D, we can deliver anything that will help your create the environment you have imagined. Our knowledgable team has many years of experience in the areas of short- and feature length film production and visual effects. Have something „out of this world“ on your mind? We can virtually build it for you using the latest CGI technology. Be it an attraction for the whole family or a scary dark ride or haunted house, we can make your ideas come to life on any canvas.

„Living“ Portraits

Portraits that suddenly come to life have become a very popular effect in the theme park and haunt industry - with a little help by some popular books and movies about a certain young english wizard that is.Since 2011 we have been producing custom versions of this effect which comes in three main variations:

Old Painting: The painting has a matte finish and you can even see brush strokes. Sophisticated lighting setup while shooting the scene, detailed post production and innovative playback and display or projection technology delivery this truly amazing illusion when presented in a baroque picture frame.

Photo Portrait: Just like a real large format photo portrait this effect has a custom made picture frame with glass to protect the image and a passepartout / mat to properly present it. A vignette is added for realism and we can even simulate the hand coloring that took place in the good old times. If lit correctly, you won’t be able to tell the difference between a real photo and this display…well, until it moves!

Special Version - Mirror: Under normal room lighting you won’t notice anything strange about this large mirror. But if you come to close, the mirror will reveal its secret as there is a display behind the semi transparent special glass that we use to create this illusion (we don’t use regular spy mirrors but a special glass that delivery superior image quality and does not darken the display behind it). This concept is ideal to create enchanted mirror illusions or Bloody Mary type scare effects in a haunted attraction.

All living portrait illusions are custom produced for you. We currently do not manufacture any off the shelf versions.But if you should already have suitable video footage or want to get creative yourself, we will gladly provide you with the required hardware. Either way, we will be happy to assist you with your ideas.

Don't Look Now is the story of John and Laura Baxter (Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie, who became lovers for a time). When their daughter Christine dies in a freak drowning accident, John, an architectural restorer, soon after finds himself in Venice renovating the church of St. Nicholas, partially as work, but also partially as therapy for himself and his wife, who took the death terribly. While there, Laura meets a pair of old Scottish spinster sisters the bossy Wendy (Cielia Mantania) and the blind Heather (Hilary Mason). Heather also has psychic capabilities, and almost instantly talks to Laura about seeing Christine. Meanwhile John experiences a series of strange incidents and accidents, culminating in his chase through the decrepit and dark streets of Venice after a small figure in a red coat whom he thinks is his daughter. He is wrong to a disastrous degree.

Don't Look Now is based on a short story by Daphne du Maurier, whose work was frequently adapted by Hitchcock (Rebecca,Jamaica Inn, and The Birds). Writing ran in the du Maurier line. Her uncle wrote the popular novel Trilby, about an artist's model who falls under the spell of a hypnotist named Svengali, and Daphne du Maurier's books and stories were widely popular. Which is surprising, because her tales are weird, strained, and grim.

Screenwriters Chris Bryant and Alan Scott (who has worked with director Nicolas Roeg on other films) have remained true to du Maurier's bleak vision and written a film that doesn't flinch from the tragic nature of life. It's one of the saddest horror films ever made. And not just because it deals with the death of a child. The film is sad also because it is about a man who denies his gift (John is psychic and doesn't even know it, and in fact calls psychism "mumbo jumbo"), and because it is about a happy marriage assaulted by the forces of fate. Don't Look Now wrestles with the sorrowful fact that we cannot escape death.

Don't Look Now is one of the great "Venice" movies. Like Death in Venice and The Comfort of Strangers, it takes a rather dire view of life in the watery city. In fact, the only "happy" Venice movie I can think of is David Lean's Summertime.

Much, much more can be learned about Don't

The park’s assistant general manager, Mark Hess, also did not return calls Monday, but said on Saturday that he is cooperating with an investigation into the dogs’ deaths.

Deputies arrested the man responsible for the dogs, 36-year-old trainer Ronnie Williams of Ponce de Leon, on Friday night after Pari-Mutuel Wagering Department officials discovered the carcasses, along with four live but emaciated dogs.

Gaming officials responded to the park after receiving complaints from residents about the smell of decaying animals coming from the kennels, according to a WCSO news release.

Williams faces 37 felony charges of animal cruelty, according to the release, and was being held on a $54,000 bond.

Three of the four “near death” greyhounds had duct tape around their necks, which had to be cut away to allow them to breathe, the release said. All four dogs were treated by veterinarians on site; it is not clear whether they survived the weekend or what their current conditions might be.

Williams raised suspicion with a local adoption agency, Greyhound Pets of America’s Emerald Coast chapter, when he delivered eight underweight dogs to the group early last week. Members notified the national chapter, the National Greyhound Association and the state’s Pari-Mutuel Wagering Department, GPAEC board member Roger Spencer said.

Both GPAEC and track officials have repeatedly told trainers they would take or adopt out any animals the trainers could not move out of the park’s kennels after the end of the racing season Sept. 25. GPAEC also provides food for trainers who are in need, Spencer said.

The nonprofit has adopted out more than 700 dogs this year and has not turned away any animals, he added.

EBRO — A greyhound trainer is facing a charge of animal cruelty and may face additional charges as the investigation into the deaths of at least 20 dogs at Ebro Greyhound Park continues.

The dogs were found dead in the kennels at the track Friday by investigators with the Florida Department of Pari-Mutuel Wagering who were looking into a complaint they received from a greyhound adoption agency.

Trainer Ronnie Williams was arrested by the Washington County Sheriff’s Office on Friday and on Saturday was facing at least one charge of animal cruelty, Mark Hess,

Hydrex Performs Underwater Stern Tube Seal Repair

SeaDiscovery.com

Thursday, October 03, 2013

In August, the stern tube seals of a 67-meter, 2223 grt anchor handling vessel were replaced in Port Gentil by a Hydrex team of diver/technicians. The old seals were damaged and a fast repair was therefore necessary. The team carried out the entire operation on-site and underwater with one of the company’s flexible mobdocks. This saved the owner an unscheduled trip to drydock.

All Hydrex offices have fast response centers. These are equipped with the latest facilities, equipment and tools to increase speed of service. Special flight containers are used to transport the lightweight flexible mobdocks. This allowed for a very fast mobilization and a timely arrival of the Hydrex team in Port Gentil.

First the diving team set up a monitoring station. Next the actual operation started with a thorough underwater inspection of the stern tube seal assembly. This revealed that a fishing net had become tangled around the assembly.

The team detached the rope guard of the vessel and removed the fishing net from the liner. The divers then set-up the flexible mobdock around the stern tube seal assembly thus creating a dry underwater environment. It allows the divers to perform any necessary work on the assembly in conditions similar to a drydock. This is essential because stern tube seal repairs cannot be carried out in the wet. Next the team disconnected the split ring and brought it to the surface. After cleaning the entire assembly, the divers removed the first stern tube seal. A new seal was then installed and bonded. The other three damaged seals were then replaced following the same procedure.

Pressure tests were then carried out with positive results after which the flexible mobdock could be removed and the rope guard reinstalled. This wrapped up the operation.

For almost twenty years Hydrex has carried out repairs and replacements on stern tube seals on-site and underwater. Hydrex said it constantly invests in the research necessary to keep developing new repair techniques and evolving existing procedures. This has made it possible for Hydrex divers to perform permanent repairs to all parts of the underwater ship propulsion system in drydock-like conditions.

For many years Hydrex's technical department has been dealing with all kinds of circumstances in locations around the world. This enabled Hydrex's team in Port Gentil to perform the seal repair under the

To treat a hemorrhagic stroke caused by aneurysm, we often use any of the following methods:

Aneurysm coiling (assisted by balloon or stent)

In this minimally invasive procedure, your surgeon will insert a thin tube into your groin area and use imaging technology to guide the tube directly to your aneurysm. Your surgeon will push a tiny coil from inside the tube into the aneurysm. The coil helps collect the blood and cause it to clot. This stops the aneurysm from leaking and prevents it from bursting again.

Sometimes, the shape of the aneurysm is very wide, making it difficult to place the coil effectively. In some of these cases, surgeons use a long, thin tube with a balloon at the tip to secure the coil in the aneurysm. In cases where a balloon does not help, surgeons can first place a stent in the aneurysm, and then put in the coil. The stent, which is a small mesh tube, helps keep the coil in place.

Aneurysm gluing

This innovative, new procedure is similar to aneurysm coiling (described above), but instead of inserting a coil, the surgeon injects a special glue-like substance to help stem any leaking and prevent additional flow of blood.

Wake Forest Baptist is currently the only hospital in the triad certified to perform aneurysm gluing. We were the second hospital in both North and South Carolina to receive our certification for performing this new and advanced procedure.

Aneurysm clipping

During this surgical procedure, your surgeon will first remove a part of the skull to gain access to the affected part of the brain. The surgeon will then insert a clamp at the bottom of the aneurysm. This will prevent the aneurysm from continuing to leak or from bursting again. Then, the surgeon will put the piece of removed skull back in place.

Hemorrhagic Stroke Treatment: Strokes Caused by AVMs

To treat hemorrhagic strokes caused by AVMs, we use the following treatment methods:

AVM gluing

In this minimally invasive procedure, your surgeon will insert a thin tube into the groin area and use imaging technology to guide the tube directly to the AVM. Your surgeon will inject a glue-like substance through the tube into the AVM to stop blood from leaking.

Stereotactic Radiosurgery for AVM

Using the most sophisticated computer imaging technology, our stroke specialist team identifies the exact location of the AVM

(AP) -- Nokia Corp. said Friday its top N8 model, aimed at making up lost ground in the smart phone market, has had power problems with some handsets not turning on after recharging.

The fault was limited to "a small number of handsets" and will be fixed in line with Nokia warranty rules, Nokia spokeswoman Eija-Riitta Huovinen said. She gave no details of whether the problem was regional or how many handsets were affected.

"We've had a lot of positive feedback about the N8. This problem involves really a small number," Huovinen said.

The N8, which looks like Apple Inc.'s iPhone, features a 12-megapixel digital camera with Carl Zeiss optics and a 3.5 inch display. It is built on Symbian 3, a new version of the Symbian software with photo uploading connections to social networks like Facebook and Twitter.

Available also in North America, Nokia's worst market, the N8 was meant to compete with the iPhone that has set the standard for today's smart phones and Research In Motion Ltd.'s BlackBerrys that are the favorite of the corporate set.

More recently, Google Inc.'s Android software has also emerged as a choice for phone makers that want to challenge the iPhone.

And the N8 has been beset with problems.

It was unveiled in April with deliveries expected in the summer but Nokia did not start shipping it internationally until the end of September.

The latest fault, though relatively small, comes at a bad time as the fourth quarter traditionally means strong growth in the wireless industry.

"This doesn't help the Nokia brand, that's for sure. The problems have been mounting for the past few years and every little negative headline adds to that," said Neil Mawston from London-based Strategy Analytics. "It's not a great start for their supposed iPhone or Android killer."

Nokia's share price was down more than 1 percent at euro7.41 ($10.11) in afternoon trading in Helsinki.

In September, Nokia replaced its Finnish CEO Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo with Microsoft executive Stephen Elop, a Canadian, the first time the company appointed a non-Finn at its helm.

The choice of a North American executive to lead a Finnish company was seen as reflecting the increasing dominance of U.S. and Canadian companies in the evolution of

"It was made on a shoestring budget and could not bring out the royalty in an opulent way. There was so much masala still left in the film that we thought we should carry the story forward," Dhulia told PTI in an interview. The sequel will hit theatres on March 8.

The 45-year-old director, who started his filmmaking journey with 'Haasil' in 2002, had made quite an impact with his small budgeted yet powerful films like 'Saheb Biwi aur Gangster' and 'Paan Singh Tomar'.

Dhulia's films have a recurring theme of a rebel as a hero and the director admits that he has a fascination towards such subjects. "I have a fascination towards those in the society who have gone against it to prove that their motive were not wrong. But I am sad that there are no more such heroes left in the society.

Even youngsters are not enterprising and it's not a good sign for a country," says Dhulia, who worked as a casting director on Shekhar Kapur's 'Bandit Queen' before making it big as a director.

Dhulia is currently working on his upcoming project 'Bullet Raja', a thriller with Saif Ali Khan in the lead. The director made his foray into filmmaking at a time when the industry was undergoing a transition from formula to realistic cinema. His Irrfan-Jimmy starrer 'Haasil', a love story set in the backdrop of student politics, was successful.

"When I started my career in the film industry in 2002 it was a transition phase of Indian cinema. 'Kaho Na Pyaar Hai' was a big hit and Hrithik Roshan was the new superstar of the Bollyood.

"But that was also the time when the typical formula film was on the verge of collapse because society was changing. I made a small film 'Haasil' and the film was appreciated by the audience and I got the courage as a creative person," he says. Born and raised in Allahabad, Dhulia credits his success to portrayal of real life on the screen.

"I am from Allahabad and have seen life closely. I have not lived life in a superficial way. I have so many first hand experiences in life and I try to present them through my films.

People love them because many have gone

Me: Oh, I see. What colour was the light coming in?

Lot: It was sort of light and dark. It was whitey-orange.

So, that's what she has said on this subject. I was (and still am) amazed at her memory. I don't see any evidence for her remembering a past life in the womb from these conversations, although one thing in particular that she said about her time in the womb became very obvious after she was born. The midwifes were amazed at how long she was when she was born. She was 58.5 cm, longer than 99% of babies, and her plot on the growth chart was actually off the graph! All she did for the first few days of her life was stretch. Every few seconds she would put her arms above her head and do a big stretch. We never saw her in the foetal position (a position we had been lead to expect her to return to frequently after birth), and she absolutley refused to be swaddled, struggling and screaming her head off when any attempts were made to wrap her up and restrict her arms. The midwives were baffled, saying that babies usually loved being swaddled. I refused to let the midwives swaddle her after so many attempts - it was clear to me that she HATED it and I wouldn't put her through it.

I had never told Lottie about this, so when I heard Lottie say "I didn't have enough space", and "I wanted to stretch out. I used to think about how lovely it would be to stretch out", I was amazed and convinced that these memories were real. She was a very big baby in a very small space.

Even now she panics if she feels trapped, hates being strapped in anywhere like when travelling in a car, and screams if her arms are restricted.

I also found this part very telling:

"I was holding something . . . was I holding your bones?

Me: I don't know, were you?

Lot: It was long, sort of curly-straight. It was thin and round. It felt like a rubber ball, but it wasn't a ball".

To me, this sounds like a description of the umbilical cord. We know for sure she used to hold that because when I was in the hospital with a foetal heart monitor attached to me her heart rate dropped really low

The fate of the East Mills School District’s buildings and, perhaps, the future of the entire school district is in the hands of the East Mills School Board.

After months of study, speculation and rumor, the district’s board-appointed strategic planning committee has made its recommendation on how the cash-strapped and geographically divided school district should proceed in the short and long term.

A former Glenwood Community High School social studies and communications teacher who is suspected of having sex with a student and supplying alcohol to another student at his rural Glenwood home was the subject of an initial investigation by the Glenwood Community School District six months ago.

A facilities study by a Jefferson-based consulting firm could provide the blueprint for the future of the East Mills School District.

The district has contracted with Iowa Schoolhouse Construction and Planning Services to conduct a facilities study of the district’s four buildings between Malvern and Hastings. The district formally approved a contract with Iowa Schoolhouse in January at a cost of $8,500.

Richard Hutchinson, Sr. has accepted the principal job at Glenwood Community High School. Hutchinson, 55, was one of seven candidates interviewed for the position that became open when current GCHS Principal Shane Stephens announced in March he was stepping down due to health issues. Hutchinson was offered and accepted the position last week.

Glenwood Community High School Principal Shane Stephens made the difficult decision to step down from the position he has held for less than a year due to declining health issues, he said.

“My goal over the last 15 years has been to be a high school principal in Iowa and I did that,” Stephens said. “When I took over this job I thought it was the right job for me, however, over the course of the last two months there’s a combination of things. But the stress of the job is more than I thought it would be.

The Glenwood Community Schools will start classes two weeks earlier in August than it did for the 2013-14 school year.

The Glenwood School Board voted unanimously Friday to move up the start of school for grades 3-12 to Aug. 13 and Aug. 14 for grades K-2 for the 2014-2015 school year. The current school year began Aug. 26 for grades 3-12 and Aug. 27 for K-2.

An entomologist from the University of Nebraska was at Glenwood Community High School last Monday creating a buzz about

The governing parties performed better than pre-election polling predicted. However, both lost ground compared with the last state elections in 2014 — before the migrant influx that boosted AfD’s support and helped it into Germany’s national parliament in 2017.

Merkel’s center-right Christian Democratic Union won 32.1% of the vote in Saxony, which it has governed since German reunification in 1990, down from 39% five years ago. AfD took 27.5%, which was its best performance yet in any state election and compares with 9.7% five years ago.

In Brandenburg, the Social Democrats won 26.2% of the vote, down from 31.9% five years ago. Like the CDU’s showing in Saxony, it was their worst performance there in 29 years of democracy. The Social Democrats have led Brandenburg since reunification.

AfD won 23.5%, up from 12.2% in the 2014 state election.

Some voters may have returned to the big traditional parties to prevent AfD from winning.

The Greens, who have traditionally struggled in the east but surged in national polls over recent months, made only fairly modest gains Sunday, taking 8.6% in Saxony and 10.8% in Brandenburg. The environmentalist party may, however, be needed to govern both regions.

Merkel’s CDU and the Social Democrats govern Germany together in a fractious national coalition, and both are weak in national polls.

In Saxony and Brandenburg, they face the task of putting unwieldy new governing alliances together, as the coalitions both lead appeared to have lost their majorities. The CDU currently runs Saxony with the Social Democrats as its junior partner. The Social Democrats lead Brandenburg in a coalition with the Left Party, which is further to their left.

Mainstream parties have pledged not to form coalitions with the six-year-old AfD, which in any case has thrived on opposition.

Bernd Baumann, its chief whip in the national parliament, said it “pushes the issues forward that really interest people out there.”

“I am glad that more and more people in the country say, ‘We will take our country back from the left-wing, green mainstream, from the old parties to certain media,'” he said.

Saxony has long been a hotbed of far-right groups

The only obvious villain that comes to mind in the entire film oeuvre is the murderously efficient government operative Colonel Muska, from the film ‘Castle in the Sky,’ who by movie’s end — and quite unusual for any Miyazaki movie — is destroyed, killed off by his own plans. And what makes Muska so different from most characters in the filmmaker’s catalogue is that he openly works to pursue his own selfish goals of power and dominance at the expense of family and clan interests.

While I am a big fan, obviously, of Miyazaki’s films, I understand that it might seem an odd fit to be discussing his work in a blog devoted to the everyday work of writing. I mean, the guy makes cartoons, right?

Yet, with only one or two exceptions, Miyazaki’s films are not intended for kids. In Japan, with its long manga (i.e., comic books for adults) tradition, Miyazaki’s films are treated as grown-up entertainments that usually, though only incidentally, feature teenage (or animal) protagonists.

The reason I bring it up at all is that seeing the art of story-telling from such a unique, such an idiosyncratic (even, shall I say, foreign) perspective as Miyazaki’s can shed light on how we as writers create our own characters.

My point, if I have one, is that I’m not making an argument for moral relativism here; and neither, if I had to guess, is Miyazaki. What I’m arguing for is the importance of psychological complexity in the construction of one’s characters and narrative situations.

Critics for centuries have spoken about Shakespeare’s ‘negative capability,’ or his ‘negative vision,’ by which they mean his ability to see inside the minds of his quote-unquote villains and unpack the stunted humanity underneath their evil facades. So too a modern example like the films of Hayao Miyazaki afford writers, regardless of their pet subjects or interests, to build-out three-dimensional protagonists — and antagonists — who, despite the honorable or dishonorable nature of their actions within a given narrative, should still, above all, come across to one’s readers as people first and foremost, in all their imperfections and mistaken assumptions and their foolish, fallible humanity.

For those unfamiliar with Miyazaki’s work, a good

Canon offered a glimpse of what to expect from the photography in the future
at an expo show in Paris this week. Kate Day picks her highlights
from the show.

Forget cables and card readers, the Cross Media Station simplifies the process of taking images off a digital camera and sharing them with family and friends.

This prototype, a black box about the size of a DVD player, automatically imports photos and videos when a digital camera or camcorder is placed on top of it. The box also contains an inductive charging pad which recharges the batteries of up to three cameras while the images and videos are being transferred.

The Cross Media Station organises imported media by recording which camera used, where and when the image was taken and uses face recognition software to group together photos of the same person.

Imported pictures and videos can then be displayed on a television screen or shared with other Cross Media Stations so that friends and family can enjoy your photos wherever they are in the world. And if you and your mum both had one, you could even send photos to print on her printer from your Cross Media Station.

So there really would be no excuse for leaving photos on your camera once these come onto the market, although unfortunately that isn’t expected to happen for at least a couple of years.

Multi-purpose camera

Two years ago Canon shook up professional photography when it announced the first full-frame digital SLR camera with HD video. They have now unveiled a concept camera capable of capturing video with a resolution four times greater than HD.

The multi-purpose camera looks much more like a cross between a camcorder and a stills camera than it’s digital SLR cousins, with the folding viewfinder from Canon’s professional camcorders. With an 8 megapixel CMOS sensor and a frame rate of 60 frames a second, this camera could transform photography once again by allowing very high resolution still images to be selected from video, rather than requiring photographers to choose between shooting still images or film.

There are significant limitations with this camera in its current form, not least that it is not compatible with Canon’s existing lenses and only has one lens. This prototype is unlikely to ever come to market as it is now but watch out for more hybrid cameras that explore ways of extracting still images from video. And never mind HD, 4k video resolution is just stunning.

World’s largest sensor

We discovered that the Cherry Blossoms were just coming into Bloom near The Dalles. We also took a walk on the Riverfront Trail along the river, (The children rode bicycles and the adults walked.) Spring was just getting started here as the buds were about ready to spring into life on the branches of the trees along the waters edge.

After the ride the three children enjoyed a frolic in the park where we had parked the car.

Gretchen and some of her coworkers ran the Three Capes Relay Marathon yesterday. It was a beautiful day and the course ran thru many parks along the coast. I was invited to ride in the car and take photos.

Tillamook has had mostly beautiful weather this month, with a few rainy days, while the east coast is freezing and covered in a thick layer of snow. Toward the end of the month the spring bulbs are not only coming up but many are already in bloom. The High School here had their 10 day fundraiser activities during the middle of the month and we attended almost all the dinners put on by the 4 classes, many just required us to walk across the street to the great facility at the Nazarene Church.

I have already started mowing the lawn which is not yet growing fast enough to require a weekly mowing but getting close. The trees are budding out but too early and a late frost may be really bad now. Also no bees yet to do the pollination work so I expect that the fruit trees will be happy and empty of produce this year. With the two days of rain that are currently falling I have transplanted lots of ground cover to a hillside at Gretchen’s house and she has sprinkled wild flower seeds. We are hoping for a dumpy hillside to turn to a pretty one this spring.

Pancake supper at church a week ago was a super success. I washed lots of dishes with much help including both Ginger and Bill. The homemade applesauce that was served with it was a real treat. Two members of the church pealed all the apples and made it last fall just for this event.

We actually did not get back to Tillamook until late in the month after spending two weeks getting there. Out first stop had been San Diego to visit Bill’s brother. Then on to Lake Forest so that Bill could spend a week actually at work. He has been working from home for the last three+ years and only makes

Well, that’s some serious bullshit. As someone who was A) a math major in college and B) has two girls at a top school I can honestly say that doing math and being pretty is not only possible but mandatory.

Sadly, this doesn’t surprise me. Have you ever looked at the model info on Forever 21’s site? They put the girls’ height and the size they wear. Very VERY disturbing. It will say: “Meagan is 6’5″ and is wearing a size small.” WTF?? Not. A. Good. Influence. On Girls!

Anybody remember the Barbie that said about the same thing (“Math is so hard!”)? ‘Cause I do! Anyway, my parents – my mom in particular – were livid about that. Just pisses me off that 20 years later, it’s the same crap.

oh, and I didn’t take much from the Barbie – just like I don’t think that blondes are best, it didn’t stop me from loving math class! I majored in chemistry (science = applied math) in college and before my son was born, I was a math & science teacher.

This is just disgusting. I’m a teenager in an advanced math class and, though the class is pretty small (8 kids), I’m the only girl. There were two others, but they switched, voluntarily, from this class to a less difficult one. This seems to me to demonstrate just how much stereotypes like this are affecting girls today.

Like many other bright and ambitious kids in her neighborhood, success meant "leaving and never coming back," she admits. She left Bell Gardens to major in math and politics at Pomona College, but the culture of political corruption in her hometown remained a thorn in her side.

"A lot of these cities have a lot of the same problems," she explains of the heavily Latino working-class suburbs in Southeast L.A. County. Arrogant politicians "would personally attack you" merely for speaking up at City Council meetings.

Garcia has been politically minded since grade school, when her mom joined local business leaders to oppose an alleged land grab by Bicycle Casino. So after returning to her home turf, Garcia took the advice of her sister, who told her to stop complaining and start fostering change.

As a math whiz, Garcia was a natural at synthesizing complex information about how Bell Gardens spent its municipal funds. There and in other Southeast 'burbs, she discovered that city employees were being grossly overpaid for their skills, especially the top officials next door - in the city of Bell.

In one of the weirder occurrences at that time, city leaders of Maywood disbanded their own government and handed over the duties of running Maywood city services to the leaders of Bell.

A Los Angeles Times reporter was poking around, considering a story on what initially seemed a potentially positive way for small cities to share their overhead costs. But Garcia knew that Maywood's ceding of power to Bell was fraught with problems. She became a source for the Times' award-winning expose of Bell's corruption.

That scandal was an opportunity for reform. Garcia helped form BASTA, the Bell Association to Stop the Abuse. She organized protests at Bell City Hall, canvassed neighborhoods, collected data and helped build the very infrastructure of a new political movement. She worked to unite the Lebanese and Mexican communities for the first time, and pressed the district attorney to act.

People started asking her to run for statewide office. "I didn't want to do it," she says. "But I felt guilty. People were saying we couldn't self-govern."

So in January 2012, Garcia announced her candidacy for state Assembly. She spent her entire savings on the race, then broke her leg before the June election.

Though out of funds, she beat supposed favorite Tom Calderon for the seat previously held by his brother,

The Suns remain the most deceptively deep team in the playoffs, and Alvin Gentry’s decision to run with a bench unit at times is not at all misguided. Every player off the Phoenix bench plays with an incredible energy, and the unique combination of shooting, defense, hustle, talent, and rebounding among the Suns’ reserves has a tremendous impact on a frequent basis. Frye and Jared Dudley were the heroes this time around, but on Friday it could just as easily be Lou Amundson and Goran Dragic.

The Suns had two essential 17-8 runs, one to start the second quarter and another to start the fourth. Any guess as to which lineup was on the floor for Phoenix? The reserve unit did serious damage in the second, and reprised their roles as gangbusters to start the fourth quarter with the help of Grant Hill. The first run brought a solid San Antonio lead to a measly two points, and the second run gave Phoenix a seven-point edge that the starters would essentially hold for the rest of the game.

Contrast that success with the limited production from the Spurs bench — Tony Parker aside, San Antonio’s reserves scored four points on 28.5% shooting in almost 29 combined minutes — and it’s no wonder why Duncan, Parker, Jefferson, and Hill weren’t enough. The four productive Suns starters (woe is Jarron Collins) just about went point-for-point with the four highest-scoring Spurs, meaning this game really was won in the trenches.

When both teams were looking for a spark, Jared Dudley came up with offensive rebounds and loose balls while Tim Duncan ran on tired legs. Channing Frye shot the lights out while Matt Bonner clanged away open looks. Having a reliable bench is a luxury that few head coaches have in the NBA, but Alvin Gentry is a lucky man. Or really, a man that has done his job over the course of the season in not only recognizing the talent that he had but also in grooming them for situations just like this one both as individual players and as a unit. This did not happen by accident.

If the Suns end up winning two more games, one could look at two of Phoenix’s offensive sequences in the mid-fourth quarter as the series’ defining moments. With Channing Frye as the lone big man on the floor for Phoenix, Tim Duncan was out of

Yes, you are all very sharp and perceptive! It IS indeed a yellow-rumped warbler in fall plumage, taken last fall in southeastern Ohio. The bird was snagging insects on a warm morning from the railing of our deck.

I guess it was a bit of a curveball to show a fall warbler instead of a spring/breeding-plumage bird.

Hi...I bird at the Falls of the Ohio State Park across from my home in Louisville, KY. The yellow-rumped is our first to arrive and last to leave warbler. Like your gnatcatcher question, I wondered what these warblers were eating in advance of any insects or fruit. While watching a yellow-bellied sapsucker, I was surprised to see yellow-rump warblers sipping sap from a sweet gum tree that the woodpecker bore holes into. Have you seen this behavior as well? Spring migration seems to be arriving late this year. I enjoyed your site...kind regards...Al

What a fantastic photograph of the bird! I love the name yellow-rumped warbler, it is such a delicate and cheery looking bird. I have never seen one of these before, but they look delightful. Thanks for the stunning pictures!

I agree with Cindy this is a beautiful shot and a very beautiful bird :) I just took an animal behavior class and I love watching the behavior of birds. Just one of my favorite past times along with reading and treasure hunting!

Gaza truce holding as 10,000 Israelis join protests in Tel Aviv

A fragile ceasefire extension between Hamas and Israel enters its second day

Palestinian rocket attacks from Gaza once and for all

7:44AM BST 15 Aug 2014

A fragile ceasefire extension between Hamas and Israel entered its second day Friday as the two sides in the Gaza conflict ponder Egyptian-mediated efforts to secure a lasting peace.

Egyptian mediators brokered the five-day extension to an existing truce to allow for further negotiations on a long-term ceasefire to fighting that has killed 1,962 Palestinians and 67 people on the Israeli side since July 8.

The calm held throughout Thursday, after a flurry of Hamas rocket attacks and Israeli air strikes the previous night, even if great uncertainty persists on both sides about the future.

As the ceasefire continued, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Israel secured supplies of ammunition from the Pentagon last month without the approval of the White House or the State Department.

President Barack Obama's administration, caught off guard as it tried to restrain Israel's campaign in Gaza, has since tightened controls on arms shipments to Israel, the newspaper said, quoting US and Israeli officials.

Around 10,000 Israelis poured into Rabin Square in Tel Aviv late Thursday, police said, calling on the government and the army to end Palestinian rocket attacks from Gaza once and for all.

It was the first major demonstration in Israel since the fighting began and organisers said it united people across often bitter divides of left and right-wing, as well as religious and secular communities.

"This is a universal principle. We want to live in peace," Alon Davidi, mayor of the southern town of Sderot, told the rally as Israel's security cabinet met to discuss the mediation in Cairo.

"I have full confidence in the government and in the army, but at the same time I ask as mayor of Sderot that they put an end to this situation once and for all," Davidi said.

Members of the crowd waved Israeli flags and held up banners calling for peace with the Palestinians and others scrawled with the words: "Occupy Gaza now!"

Yawn.

“Troubling questions about his record that were met earlier with menacing silence or anger, but never answers, can no longer be asked”

Really menacing silence? These questions cannot be asked? Odd. I thought they had been asked at least 7 million times between 2002 and today. And i believe they had been answered as well.

Did he express any regret or remorse for 2002? To quote Modi himself – would you be happy with an apology? I note there are Indians who practise Islam commenting on this site – would you be happy with somebody who caused a bloodbath, and then just said sorry? If he’s guilty, he should hung from a lamp post in a public square as a lesson to everyone. But after discussing this threadbare over 10 years, no evidence has been found. None. His past is no less dark than anybody else’s

“As Gujarat’s Chief Minister and Home Minister, Mr Modi could have reached out to the Muslim family and assured them – and by extension all of India’s Muslims – that they had the right to live and work wherever they liked in India and that he would defend their right to do so. ”

I know it is hard to leave the time-warp you’re stuck in, but the reason he did not do that is because this is not a country of Hindus and Muslims. It is a country of Indians. He doesn’t need to reach out to Muslims, because he is reaching to everybody – or nobody. And Indians – true Indians, of any faith, recognise that. The divisions between Hindus and muslims are in your head. Not theirs.

Having seen the UPA 1 & 2 bungling along the years they were in power, I feel the electorate could not have given a better reply. Modi’s speeches in Vadodara & Amdavad yesterday after the results, if anything reveal an astute leader. It was very easy to take a dip in the euphoria of the sea of goodwill that was evident in the audience. On the contrary he showed great composure and maturity by calling for the assistance and cooperation of all the parties, winners and losers. I am hopeful that his vision will prove to be an infection and will and should take all Indians by storm. We have subsisted for too long and now is the time to show ourselves our mettle.

May 8 (Reuters) - Southern California Gas Co raised the estimated cost of the massive leak at its Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility in Los Angeles between October 2015 and February 2016 to $1.071 billion as of March 31.

That is up about 1.5 percent from SoCalGas’ $1.055 billion estimate at the end of its fourth quarter, the company said on Tuesday in report on first-quarter results.

SoCalGas, a unit of California energy company Sempra Energy , warned the “estimate may rise significantly” because of pending lawsuits, possible fines and other costs. SoCalGas said the company still faces 394 lawsuits, including 48,500 plaintiffs.

It said costs not covered by insurance or delays in receiving insurance payments “could have a material adverse effect” on SoCalGas and Sempra.

The utility said the estimate included $1.043 billion of costs already recovered or likely to be recovered from insurance. About 53 percent of the total was for temporary relocation of thousands of residents living near the facility.

Aliso, with a capacity of 86 billion cubic feet (bcf), is SoCalGas’ biggest storage facility. State regulators estimated 4.62 bcf of gas leaked. One billion cubic feet is enough gas to supply about 5 million U.S. homes for a day.

The facility represents 63 percent of the utility’s storage capacity, making it a key part of its ability to deliver fuel to customers, especially when demand for heating and air conditioning is at its highest.

State regulators have limited the amount of gas SoCalGas can inject into Aliso to 34 bcf and said the utility can only withdraw gas from the facility when other options are not available to meet demand.

Many residents and government officials want SoCalGas to shut Aliso. State regulators are evaluating what impact reducing or closing Aliso will have on the reliability of gas and power systems.

SoCalGas said its system will likely be in a “better position” this summer than last year as the result of an increase in capacity after pipeline repairs.

The company said it expects to be able to meet a peak demand of between 3.6 billion to 4.3 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) with the use of Aliso or just 3.1 to 3.6 bcfd without. Last summer, SoCalGas projected it could meet a peak of 3.4 to 3.6 bcf

I have procrastinated the gargantuan task of writing a post about the Santa Maria Maggiore for far too long. I have mentioned this major basilica several times now in other posts, and have visited it at least half a dozen times. The church is one of four major basilicas in Rome, the others being the San Giovanni in Laterano, the San Pietro in Vaticano and the San Paolo fuori le Mura. It is also a papal basilica, which means that – save special dispensation – only the Pope himself can celebrate mass here from the high altar. The Santa Maria Maggiore is furthermore the largest and most important church in Rome dedicated to the veneration of the Virgin Mary. A great many artistic treasures have been deposited here throughout the centuries and the church is an interesting mix of many different styles. This post will be quite picture-heavy, as there is much that I would like to show my readers.

The Liberian Basilica

The Santa Maria Maggiore is also known as the Liberian Basilica and the Santa Maria della Neve (Our Lady of the Snow). The first name refers to Pope Liberius (352-366), during whose pontificate a first church was founded. The second name is connected to a pious foundation legend involving a Roman nobleman named John. John was a wealthy landowner who held the title of patricius. The Virgin Mary appeared to him in a dream and told him to build a church dedicated to her at a site in Rome where snow would fall the next day. Since it was actually August, this was a weird dream indeed. John told Pope Liberius about it and was informed that the Holy Father had had a similar dream. And lo and behold, there was indeed a miraculous case of snowfall on the Esquiline Hill. The Pope needed no more proof that this was the spot where he would build his new church. The whole story of Pope Liberius, John the Patrician and the miraculous fall of snow in high summer seems to have come into existence hundreds of years later and can be considered apocryphal. It is told in a large mosaic on the old facade of the church, which I will discuss in more detail below.

John the Patrician tells his dream to Pope Liberius (facade mosaic).

Unfortunately, Pope Liberius’ basilica no longer exists. Furthermore, it must have been built somewhere else on the Esqu

No, those allegations generally don't help many
causes. But, if you're Feinberg, the most important cause at hand is Cate Blanchett. And asking questions like, why would a young woman ever want to admit alleged abuse unless she wanted to ruin a movie starring Cate Blanchett?

The question of the minds of many is why Farrow,
who has heretofore maintained a low public profile, would choose to publicly
discuss her history with Allen now? The timing and focus of her piece
certainly suggest, to me, that she would like to derail any chance that Allen
or those associated with him on his latest film, Blue Jasmine, have of
receiving additional awards recognition at the Oscars on March 2.

These questions, of course, completely gloss over
the fact the allegations were first made public in 1993 and again last year in
a Vanity Fair profile and are in no
way new or now. Or that if ruining
Oscars was her thing, Farrow could have a field day with 2011's Midnight in Paris. But those facts don't
matter because what about Blanchett? We can't forget about Blanchett.

Only Farrow herself can say what her objective
was in writing this piece when and how she did. But, whether intended or not,
the byproduct of her actions may well be that some Academy members will think
twice before supporting Allen or those who have chosen to associate with him on
Blue Jasmine when they fill out their Oscar ballots. And while that
won't matter much for Allen and Hawkins' prospects — they were both considered
to be long shots well before this brouhaha — it could, conceivably, make the
road to victory for Blanchett, who is a heavy favorite — having already won
best actress Critics' Choice, Golden Globe and SAG, New York Film Critics
Circle, Los Angeles Film Critics Association and National Society of Film
Critics awards — a little bumpier.

Only in Hollywood—the land where everyone hates
priests but loves Michael Jackson and Roman Polanski—are conversations about alleged sexual abuse characterized as bumpy "brouhahas." The Wrap'sSteve Pond at least had the decency to admit that asking questions
about Blanchett's chances is an "uncomfortable" act.

The right side shows the altitude of the course.

The bottom axis is a reference time for which the gaps are measured against.

The most important thing to follow is the relative time-gap distance between athletes and the rate of time change.This shows where and how quickly things can change out on course.

The initial separation of time indicates the starting gaps out of the swim. This data, our knowledge of some of the athletes’ additional data such as power, what we saw on the broadcast and what the athletes themselves said about the race can provide a deeper understanding of how the race unfolded.

With that let’s dive into this new tool to dissect both the women’s and men’s pro races:

The Women’s Race

From the beginning we thought this was a race for second and third, with Daniela Ryf as a lock to three-peat, but the time-gap data shows that the race was anything but a lock—especially early on.

Looking at the chart we can see that phenomenal swimmers Lucy Charles and Lauren Brandon (select Brandon from the drop down to see her data) came out of the water with a significant advantage on Ryf and third-place finisher Sarah Crowley.

Having watched Ryf decimate the field on the bike at the IRONMAN® 70.3 World Championship we expected her to pull a similar move to Sanders, Cameron Wurf and Kienle and quickly reel in the leading ladies.

To most people’s surprise Crowley and Brandon actually gained time on Ryf up to the turnaround in Hawi. Looking at the chart, the only athlete to gain time in the first 60 miles of the bike on the leaders was fourth-place finisher Heather Jackson.

Fifth-place finisher Kaisa Sali hung on to Jackson until the base of the climb, where she fell off the pace and settled into a more consistent tempo settling for the final third of the bike course.

Brandon and Charles held pace at the front of the race for two-thirds of the bike. Ryf was riding consistent fairly close behind them, but not to her normal standard, and Crowley was happy to sit in a ride with her.
Just as Heather Jackson cut her overall deficit to the Ryf’s chase group to roughly a minute and a half, the rust came off Ryf and starting at mile 87 she started putting in a big effort, quickly dist

RE: Shared printer problem. XP to Vista printing.

Hope you don't mind if I piggy-back on this.
I have a similar problem but going the other way
I have a XP SP2 computer with a X1185 attached to it.
I have a Vista business comuter. Both are on a router and Vista can "see"
the XP in My Network. I can open the XP and see the printer, X1185.
I have added a network printer to the Vista "successfully". But when I
print to the network printer the spool file on the Vista shows it ready to
go, but the XP does not show it in the spool and nothing prints.

Any Ideas would be appreciated!!

What does our faith consist of? When we say we trust God, do we require proof for our trust? There are things about the Christian life that defy logical, worldly explanation. If we can rationally and logically explain how something works, then we don’t have to have faith. The power of God, which is beyond our comprehension, is the basis for the faith that we have. We are to have faith in the power of God, not trust solely in our own wisdom.

RESPONSE:

Father, it’s easy for me to get caught up in the idea that I need to know and understand everything that happens. But, I don’t. I just need to know You and place my faith in You for You are powerful and Your wisdom is so much greater than my own.

Romans 10:17–Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ.

TRUTH:

Faith comes from hearing. People must be told. We can talk about living out our faith to others, and we must certainly do that, but we must also recognize that the message is heard through the words we speak. Are we sharing with people about the hope we have in Jesus Christ?

RESPONSE:

Father, help me to be bold to share Your message for it is a powerful testimony. Your word in the hearts of those who hear is powerful and draws people to faith in You. Give me boldness along with people to share Your message with.

Romans 9:32–Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone.

TRUTH:

Paul is explaining why the people of Israel had missed out on the best that God had to offer for them. They missed it because they thought they could earn it. They thought they could work it up and could see God do amazing and wonderful things because of what they themselves had done. However, they missed the fact that God blesses because of our faith and His mercy. Are we trying to pursue God based on our works? If so, we’re stumbling over the same stumbling stone. We are to come to God by faith, not by works.

RESPONSE:

Father, my works are not even close to good enough. I come to You by faith, begging for Your mercy. I

Needlefish are commonly seen schooling near the surface of tropical and subtropical waters. Even if you've had plenty of experience with pet dogs, cats, and goldfish, pet sharks are a different story entirely. The large-mouth walleye reaches a length of 36 inches is characterized by yellowish brown at the back together with yellowish-blue undersides that are stained with dark green makings. As you can see there are three major parts to a sharks face, the lifeless eyes, the nose, and the jaw.

Water containing dissolved oxygen is drawn in through the fish’s mouth, to pass over four or five sets of gills on either side of the head. Yes but long long long ago a shark called a Meldon shark ate g…reat white sharks but nothing could eat a Meldon shark! Sharks possess a heterocercal caudal fin in which the dorsal portion is usually noticeably larger than the ventral portion. The diencephalon performs functions associated with hormones and homeostasis. Not So Picky: C. longimanus feeds mainly on pelagic cephalopods and bony fish.

Females become mature at around 14-16 yrs. of age, and can have between two and 14 "pups" per litter. Fossil mackerel shark teeth date to the Early Cretaceous. The reason that they are considered to be one of the marvels of the deep-sea is because of their potential length and weight; they can grow to be 12 feet long and weigh over 1,500 pounds! The Arcadian Redfish is endangered and the reasons why are overfishing, ‘fish pirating’, and trawling.

They have a light underside and a bluish coloration on their back. They range from the smallest of its kind which is the barbelmouth carpetshark to the largest filter-feeding whale shark. Tiger sharks also have very short, blunt snouts. Currently nine states have these laws: Hawaii, California, Oregon, Washington, Illinois, Maryland, Delaware, New York and Massachusetts. No accurate population numbers are available, but the great white shark is now considered vulnerable.

Only a small proportion of bites are fatal to man, as the snake can control the amount of envenomation, a fact probably accounting for the large number of folk cures said to be 95% effective.

Abstract

The existence of significant differences in the levels of socio-economic development of Russian regions and the need to determine state impact methods aimed at reducing inequality indicate the existence of territorial differentiation; this is the problem the article authors address. The paper proposes a methodological approach to the assessment of inter-regional differentiation, which helps solve a set of inter-related tasks on the basis of the data of state statistics and expert surveys. To assess the extent and size of territorial inequalities, the variation and Theil indices are used. The correlation and regression analysis discloses a trend to reduce differences among Russian regions in 2005-2017. On the basis of the author’s method, the integral index (aggregating 22 private indicators) is calculated; on its basis, RF subjects are grouped according to a socio-economic development level. The complexity and scale of the differentiation problem is emphasized by the fact that at the end of 2017, 43 subjects belong to the groups with below average and low development levels. The work identifies “backward regions” (18) and “regions with a sign of depression” (13), which should become a priority object of the federal regional policy. The analysis proves the hypothesis about weak influence of the state policy tools of regional development in Russia on processes of territorial development and confirms reduction in the scale and consequences of differentiation. The authors propose a conceptual scheme of the mechanism to manage the process of reducing inter-regional differentiation and overcoming its consequences, which can be used when implementing the Strategy for Spatial Development of the Russian Federation and other strategic planning documents. The results can be used by federal authorities to improve methods and tools for implementing the state policy of regional development, as well as serve as the basis for further research on this topic.

If Ebert inspired my journey, Crist inspired his, and so it was with great trepidation that I filed my assignments in her class. Challenging us to critique everything from professional artworks to public spaces, Crist placed a special emphasis on peer review — choosing a handful of assignments each class to be read aloud without byline, and to open the floor to comments from the class. These were agonizing but unforgettable interactions, leaving exposed and insecure writers aware of their printed flaws while the remainder of the class was subtly converted into more discerning and demanding editors. To some degree, those charged readings and communal assessments emerged as her real teaching legacy. I can recall how obvious my writing flaws became when read aloud, as well as how illuminating it was to hear my peers twist and tear at my arguments. I also remember how three weeks in her class instantly made me a more critical reader and self-editor, leaving me much more inclined to scrutinize my own work for the flaws that she would inevitably find. Whereas other criticism instructors may have focused on the fine art of dissection, Crist was a mainstream reviewer who relished in the interaction. Anyone could have an opinion, she would tell me, and it was a critic’s responsibility to take a stand, whip up discussion, and embrace one’s ego.

As a student still learning the ropes, questioning the value of my opinion and my grasp of film history, it was a powerful point for Crist to make: the value of my review was to be found in the authority of my voice, and my willingness to construct prose as precisely and palpably as possible. So much about writing comes down to confidence, and Judith Crist was a master at obliterating arrogance into humility, and then building students back up with skill, voice and poise.

Halfway into the course, not long after I received a particularly scathing edit of a piece that questioned not just my appraisal but also my background facts, I somehow found the nerve to ask Crist to line edit my three most cherished film reviews to date. She agreed, and I printed out the pieces (she was always averse to e-mails), and when the final day of class came and went, I assumed she had forgotten all about the request. But near the end of the semester, when she invited the class over to her Upper West Side home for cocktails, she handed me a sealed envelope with meticulous, exhaustive notes. There were dismissals (“we can skip the clichés”)

The U.S. Department of Commerce decision last week to reduce tariffs on Canadian newsprint—from as high as 32 percent to 20 percent—is welcome but doesn’t go far enough. We’re holding out hope the U.S. International Trade Commission will completely overturn the tariffs when it meets Wednesday, Aug. 29.

Regardless of what happens, we’re heartened to see lawmakers from both parties making a last-minute push against the tariffs. We applaud, in particular, five members of the Wisconsin delegation—Republican Sen. Ron Johnson and Reps. Glenn Grothman, R-Glenbeluah; Ron Kind, D-La Crosse; Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Menomonee Falls; and Mike Gallagher, R-Green Bay—for voicing their opposition in a July 31 letter to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Trade Rep. Robert Lighthizer.

The letter describes the “permanent damage being done to Wisconsin’s newspaper industry,” noting newspaper industry costs have risen by about 30 percent.

“Notwithstanding the many other tariff decisions this administration has made or threatened, this particular decision not only is adding insurmountable financial pressures on these owners and operators of our state’s small towns and weekly newspapers, but it’s leading many of them to rethink the viability of their entire operations,” the letter reads.

It’s disappointing the entire delegation didn’t sign the letter, though missing signatures don’t necessarily indicate a representative’s support for the tariffs. In a July 25 phone call with Ross and other commerce department representatives, House Speaker Paul Ryan “expressed his concerns about the negative impact” of the tariffs, according to a July 26 memo obtained by The Gazette.

While Congress hasn’t taken action to thwart tariffs, Ryan has at least spoken against them.

Rep. Mark Pocan, whose district extends into Rock County, also didn’t sign the letter, but a spokesman for Pocan’s office said the Democrat “opposes the administration’s newsprint tariffs and is concerned about the negative impacts ... on local newspapers, which are so important to communities throughout Wisconsin.”

Sen. Tammy Baldwin has been noncommittal on the issue, sending to the International Trade Commission on July 17 a cryptic letter that seems to neither oppose nor support the tariff. A spokesperson for her office confirmed Baldwin “has not taken a position

Sparzanza – Circle

Sparzanza are back. Well, have been back since March, when this 7th album of theirs, “Circle”, was released in the Northern countries. Now the stores in the rest of the world will have the pleasure of delivering it as well.

They’ve been gradually hardening their sound in the last albums, so seeing them pushing the envelope and releasing their heaviest album so far, that wasn’t a real surprise to me. Yet “Circle” has Sparzanza’s typical dark groove embroidered all over it.

Right from the start you get that impression with the opening track “Pine Barrens”. Heavier riffs, sharper beats, faster rhythm, rougher vocals… and then the chorus comes out in such a dark melody – not melancholic but rather ominous, menacing. After all, they’re singing about the “devil being back every century”…

With all that but featuring a more easy-going melody comes the next track “Underneath My Skin”, which was the rightful choice for first single, precisely due to the melodic part – it gives a more accurate idea of the album as a whole, which I believe is the main goal of a promotional single. “Black” would have been great for that purpose as well, its stronger bass making it somewhat heavier and the “church choir” hinting some spiritual sense to the melody.

As for speedy songs, I must mention “Death Don’t Spare No Lives”. A very lively but groovy song, meaning the rhythm will hit your eardrums and embrace it at the same time.

“Breathe” could have been featured in the soundtrack of a thriller, as the words I find to describe it are the same – exciting and suspenseful. And taking “suspenseful” as cue, let me tell you about the second single “Into The Unknown”. Now this is quite a piece of melancholic darkness! The double tracking of Fredrik Weileby voice, in a grave pitch and a higher one, is one of my favorite details, giving such richness to the sound. Especially when it’s not a through and through event, it only happens in some carefully chosen parts, enhancing the beauty of this song.

The sadness in “As I Go Away” is a lot stronger, though, the piano and strings making sure to produce a melody as heartbroken as Weile

We all grew up with those commercials, where a mom is freaking out over traffic, the baby, the dog and anything else. Eventually a gigantic bubble bath is all that can calm her down. She obviously has never heard of a big glass (or 3) or Merlot.

But now my feelings have changed, maybe. Not on the bath part, mind you, but the other part of it. The good news is that I can usually see it coming, from a bunch of different angles.

As any parent will tell you, nothing creates a door-slamming, kid-screaming, baby-crying, dad-drinking evening like a couple of tired kids, piled on top of a couple of tired adults at the end of their rope.

We had one of those nights on Tuesday. It was not pretty.

Grrrrrr

It actually started the night before when both kids were up too late. Brant probably didn’t get to bed until closer to 7:45, maybe an hour later for Maren. But she has this habit of sitting in her room quietly and reading for another hour or so. In reality, it’s often anybody’s best guess when she finally sleeps.

So the table was set for a disastrous Tuesday night, which is bath night in our house, and typically when things go south quickly, as most parents know. By the time everybody went upstairs for bath, Maren had already lost reading privileges for the evening. When dealing a tired kid, taking anything away is usually the last straw and it was in this instance.

She wanted no part of bath time, especially with her brother. He was so distraught he was running around the upstairs no clothes on, yelling for his sister, who was still downstairs in full meltdown mode. When Brant gets upset, his best defense is ‘dead fish’ where he flops on the floor face first and cries. This time he was so upset, he tried it in the tub and dunked his head under water.

Eventually I got the girl in the bathroom, where she was screaming ‘you are the worst mommy ever!” for taking away reading privileges. After I got her in there, she started yelling at me because “you’re the only person in the house that doesn’t love me!”

Fun. Real fun.

Best thing about tired kids? They go to sleep and wake up refreshed and ready

Washington: Days after tightening the noose of international sanctions against Tehran, the Obama Administration has said there is still time and space left for diplomacy with Iran over its nuclear programme.

"We regret that Iran has not yet made a strategic decision to address the international community`s serious concerns regarding its nuclear programme and the ongoing P5-plus-1 talks. However, we continue to believe that there is time and space for diplomacy," said White House Press Secretary Jay Carney yesterday.

He noted that the opportunity remained for Iran to take advantage of this process by taking necessary steps to come into compliance with its international obligations.

"In the meantime, even as we continue P5-plus-1 talks, multilateral efforts to increase the pressure on Iran have not ceased at all," he held.

Carney, however, said the US continues to work with its partners around the world to increase the scale and scope on sanctions on Tehran, making it clear that such pressures will only grow until Iran changes course.

The US has taken a "two-track approach" for "isolation" of Iran and is stepping up pressure on it through sanctions and other means, Carney said, adding that these were efforts to "convince" Iran to abide by their international obligations and renounce their nuclear weapons ambitions.

"We work with the Israelis as well as all of our partners in that effort," Carney said.

The US, he said, has a robust, cooperative relationship with Israel on security matters and they share a great deal of information, especially about Iran.

On Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu`s recent remarks that they had not yet decided about any "kinetic" action against Iran, Carney said there was still time left to "pursue a diplomatic course" backed by a firm approach on the sanctions imposed on Tehran.

"There is every reason to continue the P5-plus-1 talks while the time and space remains. But let`s be absolutely clear that the President`s policy is to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon," Carney said.

Meanwhile the US officials have said there has been no response from Iran on the American offer of assistance for the quake hit victims.

"Our hearts go out to those people who are affected. We have said that we stand ready to provide assistance. We have not had any pickup of that from the Iranians.

In fact, there have been Iranian public statements in the

Approach

Our starting point is the CRISP-DM methodology. First, we define the business problem, select models that will solve the problem, specify their inputs and outputs and determine their role in the business process. Then we focus on data that has potential for production operation of Propensity to Buy and we build an “ETL process” (extraction, transformation, load). The underlying data is transformed into the form of the so-called predictors, i.e. quantities aggregated at customer level for a given moment in time. The key variable is the “target” – indicator if the customer did or did not buy the relevant product. The table with predictors and the target serves as an input for the modelling stage, where we use advanced analytics algorithms (see below) to develop a model, i.e. predictors and a functional relationship, that explains the target as best as possible. We iterate the model several times and assess its performance, stability and inner logic. In the last stage, we implement the model in production, set up reporting, integrate in the business process and thus close the circle.

Areas of use of Customer Targeting

Uplift modeling

Do you feel that your PtB scores high almost always the same customers? That the same group is always hit by campaigns and the rest of the portfolio is unexploited? Then you probably do not have Uplift PtB models. The uplift concept (net lift, incremental response) is based on the assumption that our target is not the customers who will buy the product, but the customers who will buy the product as a result of a marketing contact. The campaigns then purposefully avoid the segments “sure thing” (will buy even without being contacted”) and “do not disturb” (contacting decreases the likelihood of purchase). Uplift modelling increases marketing ROI, but it requires a very high quality of CRM data on customer interaction.

Target

Target is a variable at customer level that the PtB model tries to explain. Example: the customer has a new credit card in the month of M+2 that has been activated (M is the current month). The correct definition of the target is key for the business use of the PtB model and also fundamentally determines its performance. We have already seen several models where the incorrect definition of the target led the business to refuse the model, even though the model itself was crafted flawlessly. We therefore give

For most of pre-modern New Jersey, the Senate was controlled by Republicans. There were 21 counties and 21 Senators. The smallest county, Cape May had 58,000 or so voters. The Senate Republican Caucus was ruled over by Senator Hap Farley. He needed only 7 votes from the 7 Southern Counties to block all legislation. His 7 Senatorial votes were elected by voters in Counties having in total less population than Essex and Hudson combined. Thus for most of the history of New Jersey , it was impossible for the large urban areas to get any legislation passed. The minimum wage, and most legislation granting urban aid, languished while bill after bill passed appropriating money to kill Gypsy Moths, or to build highways, or schools in the Southern Counties. That is how the Republicans held on to their power.

As you know in 1963-1964 I started the One Man One Vote case that changed all that. I was a young lawyer. I asked Chris Jackman (who was then a client of our law firm) to serve as Plaintiff. He hesitated, fearing to look ridiculous. In the days following the filing of the lawsuit, we were ridiculed in the State Newspapers. The Jersey Journal and Star Ledger carried comments by some of the State’s most prominent attorneys claiming that my lawsuit was frivolous foolish vexatious litigation instituted by a boy lawyer. They opined that I had NO chance of winning. After all New Jersey had the little federal system. How could a Court possibly declare unconstitutional the very system permitted for federal elections?

Jackman twice threatened to withdraw. Later he claimed the suit was his own idea.

I argued the suit before the New Jersey Supreme Court. I left feeling like a nudist in a mosquito colony punctured by the Courts deft questions, I was deflated and certain I had lost.

The Chief Justice called my father and congratulated him “You should be proud of your son, Jake- he made an excellent argument”

I called the Chief the following day to complain. I told him that I was very upset that he said I had done well. He asked “Why?”

I said ” Mr. Chief Justice, when I left the Court, I was depressed. I went home. I told my wife that I done miserably and certainly lost the case and as a result ruined my career. Beth never questions my legal opinions. Now my father will tell her about your call. My wife will never trust my

Four steps:Your life eternal? (Mt7:15-27-Intro)

Yesterday, Jesus taught us how to enter His Kingdom and attain what we truly need. Jesus concludes the Sermon on the Mount with a warning…and also a promise of a much greater

The Path to Eternity

life so long as we heed this warning. This is difficult to write in a public forum because it is not popular and most ignore these truths because they are not fluffy, feel-good ideas. Please do not read further if you’ve not first read the introduction to this sermon. Jesus is not discussing Salvation here, but rather how to live His true calling and Heavenly reality in your time here on earth.

The Lord’s Day of judgment is coming and we seem to be getting close, although I have no idea whether or not we’ll be alive when He comes. However, when this day comes, everything that exists (both Heaven and earth) will be destroyed and replaced with a new Heaven and a new earth. The only things in your life that will be untouched (not burned away) are the things that are founded in the Kingdom of Heaven.

We’ll take a few days to break down the sections here, but it’s going to come down to this. Jesus is going to use several parables to teach us…

Following Him is not easy, but it is the only way to eternal life.

We must be extremely careful what kind of spiritual leadership we follow.

Not all who are called will enter the Kingdom.

We can lead a life that blesses us for eternity, or we can waste that chance…most will waste it.

I hope this study will be an encouragement to you. Jesus calls us all to these things, and the way is open to all of us if we so choose. Along the way, we’ll reference other Biblical writers to hopefully make these points concrete. Jesus taught in parables so that those who would truly follow them could be taught by the Holy Spirit and could glean wisdom from these stories. Sometimes the apostles were a little more direct. If these concepts are new to you, I hope you’ll pray through the references and let God bring you understanding.

These words I type only point a direction. I’d love for you to add to or dialogue with me about these things and…invite a friend to be a part of

Don't view this movie expecting a theological exposition. Mitch Albom is a wonderful storyteller who shows us the similarities that exist in people of faith, no matter their differences in theology. Despite these differences, both men practice the care of souls in the service of God.

I recently came across this beautiful wooden swing set, which was made in the shape of a boat. Cool, isn’t it? The very first look was enough for me to start loving it. Although I haven’t yet tried building one myself, I am definitely going to. Later I realized that you can also build a baby cradle with the same idea. After all, what can be more calming than the tender rocking of a boat? This swing set will surely help your child get more gentle sleep.

Continuing along the left wall is my conduit lumber rack and a dresser I found in the trash several years ago. The dresser stores all of my smaller off-cuts of plywood or lumber that are too small to fit in the plywood cart or the lumber rack. If a piece belongs in these drawers but the drawers are full then it gets thrown away or put in my burn pile near my back yard fire pit.

Why would you buy a costly platform bed from Ikea or somewhere else when you can make one yourself at home? Oh yes, you can. A bed is the most common furniture piece used in the house and probably the costliest one. Wouldn’t it be great if you could just make a bed of your own, without having to spend many bucks for buying one? So I am here sharing a great tutorial to help you to build a nice comfy platform bed that you can use anywhere in the house.

Police found a “rape kit” of gaffer tape, cable ties, nylon rope and a roll of wire in his bedroom along with porn DVDs and magazines and an envelope listing the other women’s names and numbers with comments next to them such as “very young” and “older”.

The State Parole Authority revoked his parole within hours of Thursday’s arrest.

NSW Opposition Leader Michael Daley said the incident was more than just a rudimentary mistake and was a failing on the part of the government.

The man who tried to stop the attack is being hailed as a hero. Picture: 9 NEWSSource:Supplied

He called for a system-wide review of parole and more resources for police.

“The police do an amazing job keeping tabs on some of the most dangerous offenders in our society but they cannot do it with one hand tied behind their backs,” Mr Daley said in a statement.

NSW Corrections Minister David Elliott said he was “deeply troubled” after learning the girl’s alleged attacker was on parole for a violent sexual attack and requested an urgent briefing.

Premier Gladys Berejiklian backed her minister and said her government would address any issue that may be uncovered in the dance studio case incident.

“Once we get further details, we’ll determine if we need to take further action,” she told reporters. “NSW has the toughest parole laws in the land, we have the toughest supervision laws in the land. I don’t want to leave a single stone unturned.”

The man, who is yet to be charged, is accused of molesting the girl then stabbing a 46-year-old man in the abdomen and neck when confronted in the bathroom.

Kogarah dentist Jeffrey Stack, who came to the seven-year-old girl’s defence, broke down into tears as he spoke publicly about the horrifying attack for the first time.

“It was all very traumatic. It was a shocking experience, trust me,” Dr Stack told 9 News.

“In this instance (the parole decision) they obviously got it very, very wrong. It needs to be addressed so this can’t happen again.”

The man, who served three years in prison for the 2012 sexual assault, first became eligible for parole consideration in October 2016 but wasn’t released until September 2017, a parole authority spokeswoman told AAP

Kelly Angel I checked with local steel suppliers, and I found it is an expensive proposition to make your own power rack. The steel I wanted to use cost $12.72 a foot. If I purchased a rack of this strength, I would spend much more, however, you have to consider the cost of a welder, the fact that mistake happen, etc.

I decided to take your advice on Craig's List. I purchased a very nice BodyCraft power rack, with the cable pulldown/row attachment included, for a very good price. This unit has a 1200 pound capacity.

Since I have started using Craig's List, I have purchased 1000 pounds of weight, two plate racks, two utility benches, the power rack I mentioned above, all the cable accessories I need, an olympic set of dumbbells, an olympic curl bar, some dip bars for the rack for a total of $865.00. Not bad! Thanks for your advice on this. You saved me a lot of headaches, and I scored some really good deals.

Next purchases will be a commercial grade leg press, a refurbished exercise stationary bike, mats, and a set of power block dumbbells. Thanks a million for your motivation and great advice.

Barry C. Excellent! When you get it all together, take some photos and I'll put them up on the site.

As City Council members wrap up their visit to mainland cities with rail transit, they have discovered one segment of the population that has benefited from them: senior citizens.

And that could happen in Honolulu as well, they say, with senior citizens living in neighborhoods where they could bike or walk to libraries, stores and train stations.

"Our seniors want to age in place. They tell us that all the time. Age in place means you're still part of the mainstream community," said Barbara Kim Stanton, AARP Hawaii state director.

Places like Kakaako and Kalaeloa could gain economic rejuvenation and social enhancement if rail runs through there.

"Transit can be a tool to help us set the stage for those kinds of successful outcomes in both districts," said Dan Dinell, executive director of the Hawaii Community Development Authority. "There are many lessons to take away."

And members of a delegation led by the City Council are finding plenty of lessons during a trip this week to several mainland cities with rail transit.

"If and when you put a transit system in Honolulu -- how do you plan to foster the transit village concept, encourage more ridership and make the city more livable and enjoyable?" said Andy Robbins, director of project development for Bombardier Transportation, which developed Vancouver, British Columbia's 20-year-old rail transit system.

"They're learning these practices from all these other cities," Robbins said.

Council members Donovan Dela Cruz, Ann Kobayashi and Todd Apo are leading a delegation that includes Stanton, Dinell and representatives of government agencies and housing developers.

They started in Vancouver on Saturday, traveled to Portland, Ore., and are wrapping up their visit today in Denver.

Mayor Mufi Hannemann is expected to lead another delegation to Oregon and California next week to see, among other things, how rail transit connects to places like university campuses. The mayor also is organizing an Oct. 5 transit symposium that will bring to Honolulu the latest transit information from other cities.

Dela Cruz said the trip is validating the position of some Council members that planning for transit development must begin now.

"You have to make sure that stations are accessible and easy to get to. They have to be integrated as part of the development and they have to be pedestrian friendly," Dela Cruz said.

But Hannemann cautioned the Council not

It is designed to work with all Quasar modes (SPA, PWA, SSR, Cordova, Electron), but it is especially useful for SSR builds.

Installation

// quasar.conf.jsreturn { preFetch: true}

When you use it to pre-fetch data, you are required to use a Vuex Store, so make sure your project folder has the /src/store folder when you create your project, otherwise generate a new project and copy the store folder contents to your current project.

How It Helps SSR Mode

This feature is especially useful for the SSR mode (but not limited to it only). During SSR, we are essentially rendering a “snapshot” of our app, so if the app relies on some asynchronous data, these data need to be pre-fetched and resolved before we start the rendering process.

Another concern is that on the client, the same data needs to be available before we mount the client side app - otherwise the client app would render using different state and the hydration would fail.

To address this, the fetched data needs to live outside the view components, in a dedicated data store, or a “state container”. On the server, we can pre-fetch and fill data into the store before rendering. The client-side store will directly pick up the server state before we mount the app.

When It Gets Activated

The preFetch hook (described in next sections) is determined by the route visited - which also determines what components are rendered. In fact, the data needed for a given route is also the data needed by the components rendered at that route. So it is natural (and also required) to place the hook logic inside route components. This includes /src/App.vue, which in this case will run only once at the app bootup.

Let’s take an example in order to understand when the hook is being called. Let’s say we have these routes and we’ve written preFetch hooks for all these components:

Now, let’s see how the hooks are called when user visits these routes in the order specified below, one after another.

The upcoming ICE Totally Gaming will be held in London – a city unlike any other in the world. While your primary objective is to maximise your time by checking out everything that the event has to offer, there are many things you can do around the city while the event is running or even after the last day. It is always good to plan your visit ahead of the event so you can have an enriching and fun experience once you’re there.

As luck would have it, the 2017 ICE Totally Gaming venue is located ten minutes away from Canary Wharf. The heart of London’s Royal Docks, this area is a major business district which features over 200 shops, bars, cafes and restaurants. Needless to say, finding things to do and key establishments would not be a problem for you. For starters, there are several hotels near the venue, ExCeL London. You can use the venue’s HotelMap and get exclusive, discounted hotel rates. You can compare hotel rates and see what suits you the most. However, you have to hurry and book your accommodation as early as now because those closest to the 2017 ICE Totally Gaming venue are quickly getting booked!

Inside ExCeL London, you can find over 16 retailers, including high-street brands that you may recognise. There are several food establishments within the venue to keep you satiated. These include Costa Coffee, Subway, Upper Crust, Chozen Noodle and the Bagel Factory. If you want to enjoy chargrilled steaks or juicy burgers, visit the Bridge Restaurant Diner & Bar and have a delightful dining experience.

London is known for its thriving culture, restaurant and attractions. But after hours, it is best known for its vibrant night life. After the event, it would be high time for you to explore the best that London has to offer. The following are the best establishments to visit near the event venue:

The Narrow – Established and owned by renowned chef Gordon Ramsay, this restaurant is known for its variety of tasty dishes. Its menu includes fresh cuts, a fish of the day and other British classics, which are chalked up daily on the blackboard. If you want to enjoy cocktails, wine or beer, you can go to the bar or the conservatory where you can see the stunning river views.

These are people who believe that the United States is the greatest country in the world. They believe this status carries with it certain responsibilities. Those include an affirmative leadership role globally.

They also believe the United States is truly exceptional, not because of a shared ethnicity since the country certainly does not have that, but because of a certain set of circumstances that made this country an exception to all others. They believe it is the human spirit that drives greatness, freedom, and success. They believe that the more government gets the hell out of the people's lives, the better off the people are, and the better off the government and the nation is.

The great flag bearers of this philosophy are people like, Mark Levin, John Bolton, Rush Limbaugh, and Ben Shapiro.

On the other, we have the followers of Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. Once again, remove from the analysis whatever feelings you may have towards Sanders or Clinton. Instead, think of the things the people who put them in positions of authority believe. These folks are not the Democrats of old. They are not the people who, like John F. Kennedy, asked not what their country could do for them, but what they could do for their country. These people are totally different.

They don't believe that there are problems plaguing the nation. Rather, they believe the country is the problem. They believe the United States is the great promoter of injustice. This is because they think America is a flawed state; from its inception!

They believe that the United States is the greatest fomenter of evil in the world today. They believe that so many of the world's injustices; poverty, famine, disease, and even the future decline in the health of the planet itself is to a great extent the result of the presence and actions of the United States. They believe that because the United States has achieved a certain amount of stability and wealth, it must now give most of it up to the rest of the world.

The people in this camp believe it is appropriate to suspend due process because of the many injustices the United States has itself perpetrated in the past. They believe in socialism, wealth distribution, and in the inherent evil of their opponents. They believe that each and every one of you is responsible for the health of all those around you, and you should pay for it.

They believe that every majority group is inherently hateful, or at least unjust, towards every minority. For this reason, they

Why an invitation-only
event?There are two reasons: one was to limit
the size of the event to something I could comfortably organize by myself
(since I do not have a group of local volunteers standing by to help),
and the other was to be able to keep the focus on the national sphere.
My intention was to broaden the circle of OurFreedom list members without
diluting the trust and cohesion we have worked for so long to build. My
hope is that others will build on the "summit" concept so that
representatives of organizations in every sphere will be able to participate.Back to top

Do you intend
to impose doctrine on Pagans?There was no discussion of beliefs or theology
in the Summit. There was never any intention to discuss doctrinal issues
or in any way issue statements concerning definitions or Pagan beliefs.
The focus of the Summit was on Pagan infrastructure issues (leadership,
funding, solidarity, conflict resolution) and on our relations with the
mainstream culture (media, government, interfaith dialogue, public service
in secular culture), not on issues of belief. Our goal is to organize
around shared values and goals, not shared beliefs. The Summit was an
example of how we can preserve the integrity of our distinct faith traditions
while working collectively toward shared goals. We encourage organizations
to provide members with definitions of their particular faith as well
as identity on the meta-level as Pagans.Back to top

Will there be another
Summit?I have no plans to organize another national
Summit, though I may do so if events warrant. It is also possible that
others will organize another national Summit. I plan to compose a "Guide
to Organizing and Hosting Summits" which will be available on this
site for anyone who wants tips on creating her/his own.

There will certainly be local and regional
summits, some of which are now in the planning stages. If you are interested
in creating such an event, I encourage you to review the "Guide to
Organizing and Hosting Summits" when it becomes available on this
site.Back to top

Where do we go
from here?The answer to that question lies largely
with individuals. Summit attendees have committed to sharing the insights
of the Summit with the larger Pagan community through festivals/conferences,
publications, and the Internet. There are a

It can be said that Mayerâ€™s music is not for everyone. Hardcore â€œbutchâ€ rockers tend to think heâ€™s too girly for their taste, singing songs like, â€œYour bah-deh is a wonderlandâ€. Fans of his pop albums think his slow blues trio band is a boring spectacle in his music career, what with the dated 12-bar blues, the basic I-IV-V chord usage and the 5-minute guitar solos. Some even go as far as saying that he has no style of his own and that he just rips off the chops and licks of his major influences. No matter the case, when you come to think of it, heâ€™s a world class musician who is famous for a reason.

He has multi-platinum albums underneath his belt. He has played alongside music legends like Buddy Guy, B.B. King and Eric Clapton. He plays pop music, slow blues, rock and acoustic jazz with such an organic and natural flow to them (both live and recorded) that you would not exactly know which genre to typecast him into. Definitely, if heâ€™s got something to say about music expression, itâ€™s worth listening to.

As much as this article is focused on Mayer, itâ€™s not exactly focused on Mayer. Itâ€™s not even for guitarists or vocalists alone. Rather, it is for all musicians who persistently trudge along the coarse path of making better music and honing their musical sense. This is about how one of John Clayton Meyerâ€™s ideas on music composition can draw out a more respectful musicianship in us and how we can come out as better musicians at the end of the day because of it.

In one of his 2009 released YouTube videos entitled, â€œSynthetic Muso-Regurgative Compositionâ€, John Mayer explains that the inner and outer workings of song compositions can be based literally on â€œsnippetsâ€ of popular songs that, when put together, will give birth to a new song. At first you may think itâ€™s a sneaky sort of plagiarism. But having personally listened to the discography of John Mayer for quite some time, compare his songs, â€œWaiting on the World to Changeâ€ and â€œHeartbreak Warfareâ€

Africa: Inclusive Green Growth or Extractive Greenwashed Decay?

Would the Bank dare practice what it preaches about ending 'inefficient' subsidization, given how it amplifies irrational power relations when maintaining the world's largest fossil-fuel financing portfolio?

The debate over the Green Economy rages on next month in Rio de Janeiro, at the International Society for Ecological Economics meetings, the Cupula dos Povos alternative people's summit, and the UN's Rio+20 Earth Summit. Proponents and critics of 'green growth' capitalism will butt heads using narratives about valuations of nature and the efficacy of markets.

Boiling down a complex argument from her book Eco-Sufficiency & Global Justice, University of Sydney-based political ecologist Ariel Salleh observes how a triple externalization of costs 'takes the form of an extraction of surpluses, both economic and thermodynamic: 1) a social debt to inadequately paid workers; 2) an embodied debt to women family caregivers; and 3) an ecological debt drawn on nature at large.'

At minimum, addressing these problems requires full-fledged re-accounting to toss out the fatally-flawed GDP indicator, and to internalize environment and society in the ways we assess costs and benefits. This exercise would logically both precede and catalyze a full-fledged transformation of financing, extraction, production, transport and distribution, consumption and disposal systems.

But it is only in the struggle for transformation that we learn how institutions of power hold fast to their privileges, and why genuine change won't happen through mere tampering with national income accounts: 'torturing the data until they confess', the old economists' adage.

The World Bank is one such institution, in part because the man taking charge next month, Jim Yong Kim, is a progressive medic and anthropologist. It's fair to predict that he'll add style to the Bank's 'talk left, walk right' break-dance repertoire, spinning out arguments that will make our heads spin, while business continues more or less as usual.

A good example of environmental reformist PR can be found in the new Bank report, Inclusive Green Growth. 'Care must be taken to ensure that cities and roads, factories, and farms are designed, managed, and regulated as efficiently as possible to wisely use natural resources while supporting the robust growth developing countries still need,' argue Bank staff led by Inger Andersen

This was a while back and not too fresh in my memory (this was over a year ago), but first things first:

Korvakopla’s tale reached its conclusion. I jumped back in at around level 27 or so and we finished at 30. So, the campaign spanned some 25 levels all in all, which I find respectable.

This is how each character ended up: the team got to return to their own cosmology or stay behind in Greyhawk’s world. If I recall, we all went over, even the GH natives. Not sure, though. Joaquim became a star – literally, of course – as per his epic destiny. Now starlocks can form pacts with him. I’ve no recollection whatsoever of what happened to Tannel or Tsardis, unfortunately. Serric set out to find new evils to avenge, and Sarfgrou rolled along into the sunset on Korvamobiili, happy as one like him could expect to be.

And no, I never did overcome Bardegran’s damage-per-encounter record from twelve or thirteen levels and one tier back.

– – –

So, the more recent thing I did was participate in the Pathfinder campaign Rise of the Runelords that NiTessine ran for us. Perhaps the most remarkable thing for me personally was getting to play a D&D 3.5(-ish) character for so long. We went from level 1 to 16 (would’ve gotten 17 and 9th-level spells if we coulda’ cashed in on the XP from the last fight, mehmehmeh), which definitely marks my high with a character in this kind of game. So we did it with by following the “Fast”-column level progression, whatever. It’s still a personal high by a lot.

The party consisted of Skrym, a shoanti barbarian, Jearis Tarlangaval, a gray elf wizard-scout, Michiell “Kajo” Grellsson (or smthng, name’s translated), a human cleric-type with levels in three classes, Sir Gelrick of Magnimar, a human paladin, and me, with an elf druid named Dairhe Faulilj. The party and their details can be found on the Mekanismi Wiki (it’s in Finnish).

Not only did I

Dr Kevin Trenberth of the US Center for Atmospheric Research complains in one of the emails that modelling of sea surface temperatures “shows there should be even more warming”.

“We can’t account for the lack of warming at the moment”, Trenberth laments, “and it is a travesty that we can’t”.

The observed data, he surmises, “are surely wrong”, and the observing system, he maintains, is inadequate.

But has Trenberth reacted to the discrepancy by suppressing or “doctoring” evidence? There is no suggestion, in the emails or anywhere else, that he has.

On the falsification of research results — a career-ending offence for scientists — all the scouring through the emails has come up with nothing.

But not to worry. As propagators of the anthropogenic warming myth, the scientists are clearly the sort of people who would do such things.

And for true deniers, that is enough.

Those reading the emails not stuck in a conspiracy theory, meanwhile, have been struck by what is not there. There is no evidence of almost everything denialists have confidently maintained goes on in climate research institutes.

RealClimate site observed on November 20 that the e-mails revealed “no evidence of any worldwide conspiracy, no mention of George Soros nefariously funding climate research … no admission that global warming is a hoax, no evidence of the falsifying of data, and no ‘marching orders’ from our socialist/communist/vegetarian overlords”.

The denialists, of course, are not simply buffoons — and correspondingly, the materials released onto the internet have a darker, almost tragic side. They reveal a very human bitterness among climate scientists at attacks that have intensified in recent years.

Modern-day Galileos, the scientists confront an Inquisition based in wealthy right-wing circles and the “think tanks” that serve them.

The pressures on the scientists are described eloquently in a November 23 Washington Post blog interview with physicist and historian Spencer Weart, who said: “We’ve never before seen a set of people accuse an entire community of scientists of deliberate deception and other professional malfeasance.

To their credit, leading climate scientists have fought back against demands that they make concessions to bad science. A prominent figure in this resistance has been the CRU’s Jones — which perhaps explains

Where is it spoken?

Filipino or TAGALOG joins English as the national language of the Philippines. Although some clients want to translate into Cebuano or Illocano, 1-StopAsia’s market research leads us to recommend remaining in Tagalog if the target market is the Philippines. While Tagalog is the first language of only about a quarter of the total Philippines population (followed by Cebuano with just 1 million speakers), as many as 97% of all Filipinos understand it.

Tagalog is not only an important language in the Philippines. According to the 2007 American Community Survey (ACS), Tagalog is also the second most popular Asian language in the United States with over 1.4 million speakers.

Tagalog was originally written in the beautiful ancient script of Baybayin, but in the 16th century this was replaced with Latin letters. In the Philippines, Baybayin writing can still be seen in ceremonial uses and on the back of the latest series of bank notes.

The tiny differences between Tagalog and “Taglish”

Many Tagalog speakers incorporate English into their everyday oral and written conversation. This blend of Tagalog and English is known as “Taglish” or “Englog.” Our Tagalog translators’, editors’, and proofreaders’ extensive experience enables them to know when to use English terms and when to use indigenous Tagalog words. When 1-StopAsia was chosen in 2008 as the first company to localize one of the biggest search engine companies, there was no Tagalog spell checker or national guide for correct spelling. We worked with our partners to build up our own spellchecker and IT glossaries that now contain the standard Tagalog terms.

How 1-StopAsia works?

1-StopAsia’s Tagalog in-country translators have the necessary expertise to find the right tone (and mix of language) for your translation. Our rigorous quality assurance procedure ensures that your translation is translated and reviewed by a native Tagalog translator with a specific subject-matter specialty before it is proofread by a second translator. This guarantees that every detail of the document is checked, double-checked, and quality ensured.

We, at 1-StopAsia, are aware that responsiveness and excellent project management are the essence when working within the translation industry.

Crime reports generated by criminal justice agencies contain different information, with each type of report suited to the needs of the reporting agency. Additionally, data flows through these agencies and is subject to reductions at each step. As decribed by Sacco and Kennedy in The Criminal Event “Not all criminal events that come to the attention of the police result in an arrest, not all arrests result in a trial, and not all trials result in a conviction”. As a result, police reports are greater in number and detail and consequently are ideal for the measurement of crime.

Police reports cannot, although, be considered as an accurate count of the number of crimes since they are limited by the following:

not all crimes are reported by victims
not all police calls are determined to be crimes that should be reported
not all police departments underscore the importance of crime reports
The FBI collects crime data from police departments and has a system in place to standardize the data it receives. This system is called the Uniform Crime Reporting system (UCR). In this system, reports are categorized as follows:

murder-homicide
assault
robbery
rape
burglary
larceny-theft
motor vehicle theft
arson
Reports are collected from police departments accross the nation at the national, state, city, county and campus levels. These police departments VOLUNTARILY take the time to translate their crime data into the standardized UCR format and submit it to the FBI. The FBI then compiles this data into a annual report titled Crime in the United States. In addition to statistics on the eight offenses listed above, this annual includes statistics on:

crime volume
crime rate
violent crime
property crime
crime clearances
arrest rates
law enforcement employee totals
Not all data collection and distribution is voluntary. There is currently a Federal Law in affect titled the Campus Security Act which requires colleges and universities to collect specific “information with repect to campus crime statistics and campus security policies” and to “prepare, publish and distribute” this information” to all current students and employees, and to any applicant for enrollment or employment” upon request. The campus crime statistics must include a tally of the following reports:

murder
sex offenses, forcible or nonforcible
robbery
aggravated assault
burglary
motor vehicle theft
and a tally of the following arrests:

liquor law violations
drug abuse violations
weapons possessions

Sin Quirin and AAron Rossi of the band Ministry joined Mark and Josi to talk music and enjoy some peanut butter cups and juggling.
Sin talked about recording the latest “final” Ministry album From Beer to Eternity, how hearing Ministry on cassette tape changed his approach to music, the pitfalls of playing guitar in front of a fence, referred to Mark’s Ministry hockey jersey as a “onesie”, reminisced about being in Society 1 with a few future Ministry members and talked about his new band Supermanic and teaching guitar at the Grammy museum.
AAron talked about exceeding Al Jourgensen’s drum expectations at his first rehearsals as he played the parts that 2 drummers usually play, how John 5 practices guitar in the bathroom, confirmed there is no beef between Rob Zombie and Al Jourgenson, how Al reacted to getting a bottle of Marilyn Manson’s absinthe as a gift, playing in his new Brazilian band Black Oil fronted by Tony Campos of Static X and explained how to attain that uniquely powerful Ministry drum sound.
Oh…and Josi juggled topless while AAron’s girlfriend Mandi Martyr stood behind her covering up her nipples…

I have a very good heater that I used for Blu's one gal tank before he got moved into a very nice 5 gal. I'm not really sure how to work it anymore, since the dial was always mildly tricky and confusing (turn it towards the - one day, it gets hotter, turn it towards the + the next and it gets even hotter)

Since I'm not really sure what the actual setting is on it, how long should I wait for the water to warm up until I put my new betta baby in there?

He's in his cup right now and is getting 25% water changes every 90 mins or so from the water in the tank he'll be moved into. The water they had him in was filthy, thus why so many changes so often... I want him to be healthy but don't want to shock him. He seems very young...

I was actually going to ask you the wattage on your heater and do an actual physics calculation to answer this (WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?)

In a er...more practical fashion, I think getting a thermometer would be your best bet. It also depends on the temperature of the water you put in initially, the size of the tank, and the strength of the heater.

If you DO have a thermometer however, then all you can do is wait and just float his cup in the tank. From a physics point of view, the heat transfer from the heater to the surrounding water to the plastic cup to his current water should be slow enough not to shock him.

Floating his cup is more than likely what I'll end up doing, but what I'm worried about is it overnight getting way too high and boiling him. D: Should I just wait until tomorrow night to see what the water temp tops out at before floating his cup?

Again it depends on the strength of the heater, since you used it in the 1 Gal, I can't imagine that it would "boil" a 5 Gal tank... I'd be more concerned as to it overloading and breaking the heater because it would be on most of the time to keep up with heat exchange.

Just the fact that the newer tank is considerably larger than the previous one, I don't think overheating should be a problem, if it were a problem, it would have overheated the smaller tank rather than the 5 gal.

=( It's still in the smaller tank. I got a 5

"From writing on the back of tailgates, to selling out our first stadium tour last summer, and now bringing good music and good vibes to the Strip, BK and I just feel so blessed," Hubbard told E! Online.

"We keep reaching our wildest dreams!" added Brian Kelley. "Last year I got to direct my first video ['Smooth'] here [in Vegas], and the city's energy is just out of this world. We're all in for this one.”

The announcement follows the release of two new Florida Georgia Line songs last week "Simple" and "Colorado," which Kelley described as "the next chapter of FGL" last week. The duo's other recent chapter, "Meant To Be" with Bebe Rexha, has been a thrilling read for fans. The song climbed to No. 2 on the Billboard 200 and its video is approaching half a billion views on YouTube.

Tickets for Florida Georgia Line Live From Las Vegas will go on sale to the public starting June 9 at 10 a.m. PT via Ticketmaster, with pre-sales starting June 5.

To be clear: I respect the right of editors to make the final call on a paper, and to override referees’ verdicts. But it seems to me that a policy of not forwarding reports is a real betrayal of the crucial role journals play in the discipline as intermediaries between authors and critics. When I spend time writing detailed feedback on an argument, I expect my report to be forwarded to the author – I wouldn’t go to all that trouble if it were simply advice to an editor. Personally, I won’t be refereeing for Mind in the future now that I know that they consider reports the confidential property of the editor alone.

I had not heard of a case like this previously; I thought referee reports, unless content-free, were always sent to authors. What do readers think? What experiences have they had? If you name a particular journal, you'll need to sign your name to the comment; other comments must include a valid e-mail address at least.

Comments

Do journal editors have an obligation to disclose referee reports?

Philosopher Laura Schroeter (Melbourne) writes:

In September last year, I submitted a paper to Mind. In March, I discovered by chance that a senior colleague had written a referee report on the paper recommending conditional acceptance but had raised one main concern he thought should be addressed before publication. After many promptings, Mind finally made a decision to reject the paper this September. The editorial administrator attached comments from the editor (who is not a specialist in this area) and comments from one referee (which appear to be redacted). The comments from the colleague I’d spoken to earlier were not included; when I contacted him directly, he sent me a detailed 5pp report. Mind has not responded to an inquiry about whether they have a policy about not forwarding referee reports to authors. Moreover, the official rejection letter included the following proviso:

"Please note that referees' comments are supplied in confidence for the Mind editorial board. They are forwarded to you as confidential reports, in order to provide you with feedback concerning your submission. The Editor asks that you respect the confidentiality of this advice."

Abortion Gag Rule Is Just One Of Many Plaguing Women

October 08, 1992|by ANNA QUINDLEN New York Times News Service

They're doing the gag-rule shuffle, here in this upstate city where the Planned Parenthood chapter is celebrating its 60th birthday. The annual budget for family-planning services usually includes $340,000 of federal Title X money. But the board members and the staff have had to cast around for months now, figuring out where they'll find that money if the federal funds fall through.

To receive Title X money, they have to promise not to discuss abortion, not to answer questions or provide referrals. That is something they simply cannot do in good conscience.

Planned Parenthood in New York City may lose almost half a million dollars for its Hub clinic in the South Bronx, in a neighborhood that is in the single poorest congressional district in America, where infant mortality rates are competitive with those in third-world countries.

No matter that the Hub provides prenatal care and pediatric services for those who want to have their babies, and contraception for those who don't want to get pregnant in the first place. The motto of the gag rule might well be: Cut off your funds to spite your face.

It is a ridiculous thing, and everyone knows that this is so. But the gag, like the coat hanger, has become something of a symbol of the abortion debate.

It has become commonplace for legislators who support the right to legal abortion to be disinvited from functions sponsored by Catholic institutions.

Georgetown University revoked its official recognition of an abortion-rights discussion group only a year after the school granted it, a year in which church officials lambasted the university and some alumni complained to Rome. Sad to say, the gag works both ways. The governor of Pennsylvania, Robert Casey, tried to give a speech in New York City explaining how it is possible to be both liberal and against abortion. It was a speech he was not permitted to deliver at the Democratic Convention, and he has complained bitterly about that fact ever since.

Last week he was stymied too. Appearing before an audience that had chosen specifically to come and hear his message, the governor was so relentlessly heckled by a group of demonstrators that he finally left the stage.

What the gag rule has taught us is that reproductive freedom is not possible without free speech. You cannot competently counsel a woman who is ambivalent

The stable release of perl 5.20.1 along with development releases up to 5.21.4 have come out, and are all supported fully in Devel::Cover.
Additionally, and probably most importantly, cpancover.com is now fully up and running. For some value of fully.
"http://cpancover.com":http://cpancover.com is a site to display coverage information for CPAN modules. Previously this was for only a fairly small subset of CPAN modules, although I had tried to make it a relevant subset. Now, coverage is reported for all current CPAN modules, both stable and development releases, and coverage information for previous modules is not deleted. Of course, the coverage information is only available if the module can be installed, and the tests can be run on the server I am using.
On that subject, the server has been kindly donated by Bytemark. It is one of their bigv servers and runs Ubuntu 14.04. In order to cover all of CPAN I needed more disk space, and Bytemark very graciously agreed to the increase here too.
The coverage process runs continuously, looking for newly uploaded CPAN modules and then calculating their coverage. New CPAN modules are found using CPAN::Releases::Latest by Neil Bowers with index caching turned off.
In addition to the usual HTML coverage reports, there are also JSON files available if someone just wants the raw data. There is a top-level file at "http://cpancover.com/latest/cpancover.json":http://cpancover.com/latest/cpancover.json detailing which modules have been covered and the summary coverage information.
Then there is a JSON file for each covered module providing run and file-level coverage information. For example the aforementioned CPAN::Releases::Latest has "http://cpancover.com/latest/CPAN-Releases-Latest-0.06/cover.json":http://cpancover.com/latest/CPAN-Releases-Latest-0.06/cover.json
With all this in place, plans are under way to make the information available on the metacpan. See "https://github.com/CPAN-API/metacpan-web/pull/1128":https://github.com/CPAN-API/metacpan-web/pull/1128 for the

At all times relevant, Bret Sher insisted that Party Animal’s Cocolicious was Organic and had to go through strenuous protocols to be labeled Organic and that even though the food was made in a plant that had a prior recall, that there was no possible way the Party Animal food could be affected because it is packed by hand and the recalled food was not. Mr. Sher vehemently denied that the Party Animal pet food made by his company, Evanger’s was tainted.

Nonetheless, Mr. Sher requested that Ms. Black put all Party Animal food in her possession outside of her home and stated that FedEx would come pick it up and that he would replace the food with a different food at no cost. Ms. Black had nine cans of unopened Party Animal Chicken/Beef from lot # 0134E1523713 and ½ can of Beef and Turkey from lot # 0136E1520404 (best by July 2019) which was secured in Ms. Black’s freezer.

FedEx picked up the first box and then Ms. Black found an additional can and let Bret Sher know. Sher sent FedEx again to retrieve the pet food.

Plaintiff insisted that the subject pet food be tested for contaminants or toxic agents, but neither Party Animal nor Evanger’s would confirm that testing would or had been conducted or provide Plaintiff any further information. They were, however, very anxious to relieve Ms. Black of the food samples.

Fortunately, Ms. Black, not not allow Defendants to take away all the tainted pet food, and thereafter sought professional laboratory testing of the food. After considerable efforts, a qualified laboratory from Texas A&M University tested an unopened can of the suspect Party Animal food. The tested food contained the euthanasia drug, Pentobarbital.

Having confirmed that Party Animal’s “organic food” actually contained a drug that is specifically used to kill animals, Ms. Black set about to determine if the pet food she purchased contained any of the other promised healthy and fresh ingredients. Further testing showed that Party Animal “Cocolicious” dog foods did not contain coconut or coconut compounds as advertised. In summary, it appears that Party Animal and Evanger are preying on unsuspecting animal lovers by falsely advertising its food as organic, wholesome, fresh and as containing other healthy and natural ingredients, when in fact, the only thing different about the food is the label and its marketing scheme.

Sentenced to Death

Sentenced to Death

A Viva! report on the slaughter of farmed animals in the UK

INTRODUCTION

Almost 900 million farmed animals are slaughtered for the dinner plate each year in the UK. The shift towards huge commercial enterprises means that less than 600 abattoirs are responsible for this vast killing operation. Every day, over two million living animals are unloaded from transporters, often after enduring lengthy journeys in cramped conditions. They are shunted through industrial buildings - often with electric goads - before meeting the slaughterman's knife.

In order to eat meat with a clear conscience, many consumers imagine the killing process to be a sanitized affair. Indeed, most meat-eaters agree that no animal deserves to suffer at the time of death. This concept of humane slaughter is supposed to be at the core of UK slaughter legislation. Welfare minister Ben Bradshaw, says that killing must be humane and that animals must be stunned so that they are unconscious and unable to feel pain during slaughter by bleeding (1).

Sentenced to Death proves beyond doubt that the Ministry of Agriculture's soothing words are meaningless. We have reviewed the latest scientific literature and obtained opinions from experts across the board. As a result, we have built up an extremely disturbing picture of the reality behind Britain's killing factories. Tens of millions of animals are being ineffectively stunned and are regaining consciousness while they bleed to death.

Estimated numbers of animals regaining consciousness

Each year, 1.8 million electrically stunned pigs regain consciousness before they die from loss of blood. 244,800 pigs a year are not stunned at all. Four million pigs a year are stunned with carbon dioxide gas. It takes pigs up to 30 seconds to lose consciousness and during that time they will squeal, hyperventilate and try to escape.

Each year, five million electrically stunned sheep regain consciousness before they die from loss of blood. Scientific research shows that electrical stunning may not cause unconsciousness at all.

Each year, up to up to 230,000 cattle each year are not correctly stunned with the captive bolt pistol. They will have to endure the pain of being shot in the head and will then have to be shot again or knifed whilst conscious.

Each year, 62 million chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese regain consciousness before they die from loss of blood. 8.4 million are conscious when they enter the scalding tank.



Close to 30,000 patients infected with the novel coronavirus are currently hospitalized, according to the French health ministry.

6:25 a.m.: Positive cases top 10,000 in Africa

At least 10,075 people across Africa have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, according to figures released Tuesday by the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

So far, 487 people diagnosed with COVID-19 have died.

The Northern Africa region has, by far, the largest cluster of cases on the continent, with 4,485 confirmed infections. However, with 1,686 positive cases, South Africa now has the highest national total, surpassing that of both Algeria and Egypt, according to the Africa CDC.

5:05 a.m.: Japan declares state of emergency for seven prefectures

Japan on Tuesday declared a month-long state of emergency for Tokyo and six other prefectures to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced the order in a brief televised statement, saying the country’s outbreak was threatening to gravely impact people’s lives and the economy.

The declaration, effective through May 6, empowers governors of the prefectures of Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama, Chiba, Osaka, Hyogo and Fukuoka to take more preventative measures, such as requesting citizens to stay home, calling for businesses to close as well as shuttering schools and other public facilities. Supermarkets and other essential businesses are allowed to remain open.

However, the declaration is not expected to lead to drastic urban lockdowns like the ones seen in Europe as Japan’s post-World War II constitution limits the central government’s powers.

At least 3,906 people in Japan have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and 92 of them have died, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University. The Japanese government has admitted that infection routes cannot be traced in an increasing number of cases.

3:30 a.m.: China reports no new deaths for first time since January

China on Tuesday reported zero new deaths from the novel coronavirus over the past 24 hours.

China’s National Health Commission recorded 32 new cases of confirmed infections across the mainland, all of which were imported from abroad, as well as 30 new asymptomatic cases. However, it’s the first time the country has reported no new deaths since the commission began publishing daily figures in late January.

Moving from the Buffet Line to the King’s Table: Savoring Mercy

Where do you want to go to eat? This question in my home typically elicits one of three answers. If it’s not my children’s favorite fast food joint or a place serving breakfast all day, it’s almost always their favorite buffet – known affectionately in our home as the hog trough. Why? Because buffets are full of choices – unending choices, sure to please the pickiest eater. Of course, the enticing, all-you-can-eat dessert station, complete with cotton candy, might have something to do with their palate’s restaurant of choice.

Our lives are often a lot like that buffet. Every week includes a series of choices – some that fill us well and others that feel good for a moment, but leave us empty, like the cotton candy in the dessert line. But in any case, we make the choice – from the places we shop, to the sports we play, to the videos we stream on the device we choose to carry into the restaurant we choose to patron, to the church activities in which we engage. Life’s options often feel like a line at the local buffet. In fact, for many of us, the Christian life has become a series of trips to the buffet line.

Hurry Up and Wait!

Nearly every morning, one of my children waits by the door. Backpack slung around their shoulders, left hand on the doorknob and eager anticipation written on their face. “Dad, can I go yet? I don’t want to miss the bus!” “Not yet,” is often my reply 5-10 minutes before it’s time to leave. “Isn’t there something you can do while you wait?

This familiar exchange reminds me that unlike their father, this young child has mastered the art of being early, which means the opportunity to learn the art of “hurry up and wait!”

Life, in many ways, is a series of waitings – filled with regular opportunities to hurry up and wait. We wait to graduate from school. We wait to hear back from a prospective employer about a new job. We wait for the day we can finally afford that house, that car, that vacation. We wait to meet the love of our life. We wait for the birth of a child. We wait by the bed of

Running burns more calories than almost any other exercise, improves your heart health, boosts mood and offers a host of other benefits. Whether you're thinking about running or have been doing it for a while, it's important to keep in mind some basic training principles when you run. Although it seems pretty simple, there is more to think about than putting one foot in front of the other.

Here are five mistakes runners make and how to avoid them:

1. Running too much too soon. It's important to build up your training program gradually. If you go from running 3 miles a week to 30, chances are you'll end up injured and burned out. Follow the coaching principle of adding no more than 10% of your previous week's miles to your training plan each week. So if you run 20 miles one week, 10% is 2 miles, meaning you can run 22 miles the next week.

2. Doing the same thing everyday. On the flip side of overtraining, many runners get stuck in a rut and run the same speed and distance every day. If you never vary your intensity or distance, you won't improve your fitness level or your running performance. Mix it up and do some speed workouts, pick a race to train for, and follow a running program that continues to challenge you.

3. Comparing yourself to others. We all are at different stages in our lives and training, and comparing yourself to others' performances and achievements will only make you unhappy. Commemorate your own milestones and appreciate your running journey. Remember what you love about running and you'll be much more likely to stay motivated and happy.

4. Eating anything because of running. Just because running burns a high amount of calories doesn't mean it's a free license to eat crap. Think of your body as a machine that needs good fuel. Sure you can run on processed or fast food, but you'll run better and feel better if you eat a balanced diet with a variety of whole, healthy foods.

5. Obsessing over numbers. This is especially common for advanced runners. Judging your running by your best race times, and highest mileage will only lead to feeling burned out and never satisfied. While these are milestones to celebrate and ways to mark progress, keep in mind the bigger picture as well. Being able to go out for a run and see the world, having the health and strength to run, feeling inspired after your

Most often, our “reading” actually becomes a back-and-forth conversation about what she is thinking and feeling about what she sees and hears. Because we often are re-reading titles, I do it in a different way each time and add funny voices and add/subtract dialogue wherever I think it fits. Bottom line: there is no wrong way to do it, just do it!

Let them read to you

This won’t come for a while, but eventually your kids will pick up on what you’re doing and begin to do it themselves. It’s honestly one of the biggest thrills of my life when Kaitlan picks up a book and does voices and mimics the stories she’s heard dozens of times.

Ask questions

Enrich your reading experience by asking questions. Simple things like asking them to point at certain objects or if they can count how many of something is on the page. They remember you’ve done this too. Kaitlan now points out the dolls on every page of one of her books every time and knows that the bottle of milk in her farmer’s market book is the same bottle she has before bed.

Invest in different types of books

You never know what will catch them on a particular day. Have books with textures, pop-ups, pull-outs, lift-flaps — anything! Books with flaps, pull-outs and textures were some of the first that Kaitlan really gravitated toward.

Carve out a time and place, but never say no to reading

By having books in every room and places to sit and enjoy them, we’ve increased both the probability and frequency Kaitlan reads them. But when she comes to us outside those areas, we always work to acknowledge her desire to read or read with us, even if we’re busy.

Do you have reading tips for babies and children? I’d love to hear more ideas, especially if you’re kids are a little older!

Two freinds of mine (they are sisters) have emphysema; they are in their late forties. Both also have asthma and bronchitis.

I was preparing an Instagram post. I had my sufficiently
athletic-looking fitness clips, an appropriate song, and what I thought
was an amusing caption. For whatever reason the editing app was giving
me trouble. Every time I would get ready to save the video the app shutdown and I would lose everything. This happened several times
and I was becoming increasingly frustrated. Since I have been
intentionally practicing mindfulness I reminded myself to breathe. I
tried again, but this time I breathed in, held, and
exhaled out. I somehow knew if I just relaxed it would work. Sure
enough, it did.

This
simple example reminded me how often I live in a frantic state.
Outwardly I appear calm; inwardly I'm like a dog spazzing out
trying to get one of those cones off its head. It's almost like I'm
afraid if I don't hurry and free myself I'll be trapped in my
circumstances forever. This perspective, however, only heightens the
desperation for things to change. Instead, I took charge of the moment in the
only way I truly could- by accepting it.

Acceptance
isn't about liking your reality. You could very well want to change it.
It's just that in order to keep your peace you train yourself to accept
what is right now. You fully enter into the present moment without
ruminating on the past or fretting about the future. It reminds me a lot of this scriptural passage about worry.

Matthew 6:25-27

25 “Therefore
I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about
your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more
than clothes? 26 Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow
or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are
you not much more valuable than they? 27 Can any one of you by
worrying add a single hour to your life?

I think of this passage often as there
are usually dozens of worries that plague me at any given time. They range from
the inconsequential like whether I'll create a satisfactory post for
the gram, to the considerable like will I be okay now and in the future. Either way, I

If the spent fuel rods achieve re-criticality, then they will be generating their own heat.

Except. Um…

To my knowledge, this time there will be no control rods. At all.

There will also be no containment structure.

There would be no control rods because spent fuel pools are not designed to need them. They don’t ever go re-critical, remember? There’s no containment structure because spent fuel pools don’t need them. Remember?

Here’s What Happens If That Happens:

I don’t know, and I don’t know the likelihood of it happening. I also don’t know the magnitude of the problem if it does. However:

The size of the spent fuel pool at reactor #4 is 142 tons; I don’t know about the one at #3.

I am presuming from news reports that this mass estimate is the total weight of the fuel rods, which includes the whole assembly; it’s not just the fuel; it’s also cladding, which is zirconium alloy, and other stuff that keeps the fuel rods together.

I don’t know if a given spent fuel pool is uranium or MOX. Various reactors at Fukushima were loaded with either uranium or MOX — and I have no guarantee that the pools at #3 and #4 only include spent fuel from those reactors, so there’s no way (from here) to find out if we’re talking uranium or MOX in the #3 and #4 spent fuel pools.

On short notice, I can’t find a good reference for what the mass is for the MOX fuel in active core of a Fukushima-sized reactor.

The best I can do is to guess, based on megawatt output and my meager reading in uranium metallurgy, that IF all the reactors at Fukushima were uranium-fueled reactors, we would be talking about something between 5 and 10 kilograms for a single active core.

That’s 5 to 10 kilograms.

They’re not uranium-fueled reactors; some are mixed uranium and plutonium (MOX). (Plutonium is far more toxic, by the way, though some of its fission products are ultimately the really dangerous stuff). Knowing little about metallurgy, I can guess at the uranium because uranium’s a whole lot simpler to understand. In any event,

The current Greek institution responsible for carrying out the privatization schemes demanded by the Troika, the HRADF (Hellenic Republic Assets Development Fund), is, according to the ESM report, malfunctioning and should therefore be replaced by a newly established Holding Company. Most striking is the statement that Greece should not have any say in the privatization process of its own public services: “it is necessary that the Holding Company operates at arm’s length from the Hellenic Republic in all respects,” (p. 28).

As outlined in Annex I to the ESM report, “the majority of members of the Supervisory Board could be appointed by the Troika/ESM/EFSF” (p. 33). This Supervisory Board (“or the Troika/ESM/EFSF”, p. 34) then appoints the majority of the Board of Experts and the minority of the Board of Directors. The ESM proclaims that their proposed plan – setting up a foreign company that is part-ruled by the Troika to decide on the fire sale of Greece’s public services – will “combine in an obvious way the interests of the Hellenic Republic, its taxpayers and citizens and their creditors” (p. 31). However the ESM’s plan really serves only the latter.

Transparency’s trade-off

The ESM deals with millions of taxpayers’ euros, and the social consequences of the austerity programs attached to their loans have proved destructive (sky-high unemployment, reduced access to health care, increasing poverty and homelessness, and general demolition of the welfare state). Despite these far-reaching political consequences, little is known about the ESM's internal workings. It is hardly unreasonable given that the EU is meant to be a democratic system, then, to demand a fair degree of transparency over how the fund makes its decisions, who it consults, and why.

Yet up until now it seems that the ESM has followed its Managing Director Klaus Regling’s personal stance on transparency, expressed at a conference on the IMF over a decade ago: “there is a trade-off between transparency and efficiency[…] In an emergency, the fund has to be able to act quickly even if that reduced the understanding of outsiders.” The ESM seems to suffer from a permanent state of emergency, as the complete lack of transparency is ongoing.

the contrary. The danger is that far-leftist academics will hijack the government's campaign to raise awareness of Jews from Arab countries for their own ends (with thanks: Lily):

Among the subjects to be taught in the programs, the first of their
kind, are Jewish literature written in Arab countries, literary Arabic
and Judeo-Arabic (an Islamic-world counterpart to Yiddish in Europe).
There will also be comparative literature studies
looking at Jewish literature in Arab countries and Jewish literature in
Europe.

“The idea for the program came up in a conversation in the car about
three years ago,” recalled Hadas Shabat Nadir, a literature researcher
at Ben-Gurion. “Dr. Hana Soker Schwager [of Ben-Gurion], [poet] Shimon
Adaf and Dr. Haviva Yishay [of Ben-Gurion] were
there, and over time the poet Almog Behar and Prof. Galili Shahar [of
Tel Aviv] also joined. It started with our wondering why there were
programs for the study of Yiddish and other similar programs, but no one
was teaching Jewish Arab culture.”

The program became a reality after a request for funding to the Yad
Hanadiv foundation, which represents the Rothschild family philanthropic
trusts, got a positive response and after the committee responsible for
the funding insisted that a full bachelor’s
degree program be created.

Why 'Jewish Arab,' not 'Mizrahi'?

Although Jews from Arab countries are commonly referred to as “Mizrahim”
in Hebrew, Shabat-Nadir explained the decision to call the subject of
the program Jewish Arab culture and not Mizrahi studies:

“We wanted to present the entire story. We all were uncomfortable with
the definition ‘Mizrahim,’ because when people use it, they forget an
entire history, important people, accomplishments and writing over the
generations. We wanted to link the Mizrahi concept
to its history, to where it comes from. The concept of Mizrahim
developed in Europe and ultimately those who sought Westernization
called the Jews from Islamic countries Mizrahim. The field and the
dialogue that we are talking about is Jewish Arab.”

Behar said, “In the coming year, we will build the syll

The worst-case scenario for France is a Lothar-like storm relocated approximately 100 km west of the original event but which would still significantly impact Paris. The losses from this scenario are not much higher than Lothar’s. At only 15 percent higher the small increase in loss reinforces Lothar as an exceptional benchmark for the insurance industry.

We found that the majority of scenarios in the study produced notably lower losses. This is because the displacement of the storm, by even small distances, meant that the most extreme wind speeds impacted much lower concentrations of insured exposures. The study reinforces our understanding of the sensitivity of windstorm loss to a storm’s path. It also highlights the importance of using a stochastic model containing tens of thousands of events to be able to comprehensively evaluate potential windstorm losses.

London at risk

No European city is immune from damaging windstorms. RMS also re-located Lothar over London—only a 350 km shift to the north—to see what the impacts would be. We calculated the insured loss for Europe could be as much as 25 percent higher than Lothar’s losses and potentially bigger than the $8.6 billion loss caused by Daria.

The uncertainty inherent to the climatic phenomena that drive windstorms makes it impossible to forecast exactly when and where the next strong storm will hit France or Europe. However, catastrophe models can at least help to evaluate the potential financial impact of extreme storms like Lothar.

And this is also the most interesting part about the game. There is an extremely large selection of various races and all of them play very differently. The death masters Ermor do not care for the well-being of their provinces, they only care to make as many as possible corpses in order to raise them as undead. Hence, eventually their provinces end up having no population at all, which doesn't matter, because they'll continue fighting with magically summoned units. Contrary, other races depend quite a lot on the well-being of their population, be it as sources for blood slaves, as sources of income or as sources for normal troops.

In addition to that, there is an extremely huge amount of various spells and it is only at the beginning that they all seem alike. Once a single mage attacked my well-defended province containing some 500 troops. Enough to say that ever since then I know that some spells matter quite a lot, because that one mage won the battle and I had no survivors.

Generally, this game is most about your own imagination and your strategic thinking. After a while you stop noticing the ugly graphical representation (just as you did when playing Civilization I) and it all plays in your head. After a while even when not playing you begin to think about whether your newly summoned fiends will hold back that Jotunheim invasion. And the strategic part in you will constantly plan new strategies, think about whether playing that race is better than playing this race or whether you should concentrate on summons or on mighty mages. All that sums up to a much more intense role-playing experience than what you get from recent so-called rpg games such as Oblivion. The skills of your pretender god really influence your way of winning (or losing) and vice versa during time you influence the skills of your god. Having stats for every single unit in the game and them having a significant influence on the outcomes of battles certainly helps.

By the way, there is also a nice touch of humour added into the game. For example, one of my provinces became independent with a text message saying that a group of local heroes took it up to free the province from my reign. And it's role-playing when I left that province independent and even took care that no AI bothered them.

AI

In such a game, AI is very important and it does not fail to deliver. Actually, I have yet to win a game against 8 A

So a depressing election night draws to a close ... But politics doesn't just happen once every five years, it happens every day: in creative action, in voices speaking out about what they believe, in changing hearts and minds. So I will not cry into my morning cup of tea, I will aspire to go out and continue with the real politics I and others can believe in. because boy will there be work to be done!

I know I am extremely lucky to be able to be involved in lots of things about which I am really passionate. So for me, that real politics began on Friday morning when I had the privilege of helping facilitate a mock election among the students I teach at St Chad's Sanctuary. Their insights and ideas were just the inspiration I needed at that moment.Beginning with a discussion of the necessary qualities of a leader, none of them, funnily enough, mentioned being photogenic or media-savvy. Instead they called for those who are honest, promote justice, have faith in the new generation, are good diplomats, are fair, want human rights, are "strong but also kind" and, in a tell-tale sign of other experiences who are "able to pass the power to others in a good way". Fourteen students from Iran, Eritrea, Congo, Sudan, Guinea and Syria formed four political parties. They wrote their manifesto, trained up their candidate, presented their ideas and voted for the new prime minister. Any of them could have got my vote.

As this was going on, there was plenty of opportunity for discussion: about policies and the things they hold dear, but also about political experience and what it means. My Congolese student who had previously told me "I don't like elections because too many people died" was clearly in his element presenting his vision for an alternative. The Sudanese students reflected on whether the situation in their country, where opposition parties are allowed to exist even if the endemic corruption and violence means they are never elected, is perhaps slightly better than the experience of their Eritrean classmates, where all opposition groups are completely outlawed.Relatively limited English didn't prevent them choosing policies which encompassed big themes. They were a reminder of how often our politics, bogged down in minutiae and personalities, forgets to communicate the principles and values we ought to hold most dear. In spite of hesitant English and evident nerves, they presented their ideas with clarity and passion.For all of them, peace,

Some of the features are interesting, like twin sunroofs with what they’re calling Magic Sky Control, a layer of electrified glass that can change from transparent to opaque, offering you the choice between a sky view or heightened privacy.

That’s genius. It’s just genius.

The rear windows are also a little smaller, for more privacy and a quieter interior. How do you feel about that?

A smaller window? It depends on the car. I understand what they’re saying about privacy, and that’s always wonderful, but it really depends on the car.

What’s your favorite Maybach model?

For me, it’s my first model, which was the 57S. I still have it. A lot of beautiful memories in there. I love it. It’s beautiful.

How soon into your career did you decide to go with that branding?

After I made my hit record, in ’06, I went on tour and traveled the world. I was just saving my money—I wasn’t buying anything for the first year, or year and a half. But when I was traveling around the world, the one thing that’s consistent, and I see country to country, whether I’m in Nice, France, or London, regardless of where I go, is that the biggest businessmen in the country drive Maybach. And I said, “That’s what I want to drive.”

After I purchased my first Maybach, which I want to say was in ’08, it became a lifestyle and a culture. I make Maybach music. The music I make, when I bring the best producers together, when me and Jay Z collaborate, when me and Kanye West collaborate out in Hawaii for two weeks—I’m just ready to get back home and play it in my Maybach.

Some guys like listening to their music in the studio, or in a club setting, but for you, it’s official when you hear it in the car?

Did you hear any people doubting that you would be able to release two full-length albums in one year?

No, I’m not really into that. We do this every day. We win every day; tell them to check the scoreboard. I haven’t lost since I came in the game. So if someone is saying, “You’re going to lose,” to me

2013 will be Kirk Ferentz's 15th year as the head coach of Iowa.

During that time he has worked with two separate offensive coordinators, both of who served as the quarterback coach. He has had three different wide receiver coaches, two running back coaches, three tight end coaches and three offensive line coaches. He has had seven different starting quarterbacks.

Regardless who has been in these roles, two issues have consistently plagued the Iowa offense: clock management and the two-minute offense.

Arguably the greatest single Hawkeye play over the last 14 years—Tate-to-Holloway—was a fortunate result of boggled clock management.

The changing faces that have worked within the Iowa offense support the reality that the problem, as it concerns clock management and the two-minute offense, is wholly Ferentz.

The two-minute offense and clock management are elemental parts of football, just like the goal-line defense or the kick-return team.

Ferentz must realize this is a chronic problem. If he doesn't, then he isn't qualified to coach high school football, let alone FBS college football.

Assuming he does realize it is an issue, in his 15th year in Iowa City, he has to commit to fixing it.

Decide What Iowa's Offensive Identity Is

4 of 10

I went over this in depth in a previous article, but the overarching issue with the 2012 offense was that it lacked an identity.

The season started with what seemed to be an offense that mostly resembled what Greg Davis wanted to do. Then it quickly veered towards the Kirk Ferentz/Ken O'Keefe model that Hawkeye fans have known for the past 14 years.

In the end, it was a Frankenstein-esque mish-mosh of two offenses that didn't complement each other.

The offense that Greg Davis ideally wants to run is up-tempo. He wants to extend the game, spread out the field, open up the run via the pass and have receivers run short, quick routes that allow them to catch the ball going full speed.

Meanwhile, Ferentz's ideal offense takes its time. It shortens the game, collapses the field, opens up the play-action pass via the run and has receivers make plays downfield using their physicality.

In the end, Ferentz's offense can

decorative papers, several kinds that go well together

scissors

glue (I use a simple glue stick, but if you work on canvas you might prefer an acrylic medium)

some black markers or pens that will write well on both the paper and the background

a circle template (this one's optional, perhaps you like to draw and cut your circles by hand, but I'm anal so I need a template, haha)

What you also need is a playful attitude and the realisation that this is supposed to be a fun and loose exercise, not deep meaningful art. Just saying. ;-)

Start by putting colour on your background. I am showing you four pages from the sketchbook so you can see how different backgrounds get different results. The first two are very hodgepodge, let's-get-some-colour-on-there.

As you can see the second set of pages has more specific shapes. Circles and a grid. I chose my colours to fit the colours of the paper I picked out, but you can totally choose to go for more contrast and see what happens then. Experiment people!

Now it's time to put your substrate aside and get out the paper. I picked four different kinds that matched well. I do love pretty papers!

Now take your scissors and cut that paper up. Cut squares and rectangles and use your circle template (or your less anal cutting skills) to cut circles of different sizes. It's important to get different shapes and sizes.

I usually stick to rectangles and squares and circles, but there is no reason at all why you shouldn't be cutting diamonds, hearts, stars or whatever you fancy if that's what you want.

When you've cut up your paper put the shapes aside where you can easily see and reach them and get your substrate back on the table.

Now the real fun begins! Pick a bunch of shapes and start arranging them on your backgrounds. There's all kinds of rules for composition, but I would just like to say: put them where you like them and let that be that. ;-)

Try to vary different sizes and shapes to see how they go together. Don't overthink it. We're not going to win any awards with these compositions, we're just playing. Have fun with it!

If you have come to a composition that you like, glue that stuff down! Now the base of your work is

From July 1999 to January 2000, the Sejake family of the Motlonyane village in South Africa became victim to a tokoloshe.

Household items were thrown about, insulting writing appeared on the walls and doors, family members were spat on and swearing was often heard. Except for the Sejake’s young son, no-one ever saw the culprit.

This boy was particularly targeted by the tokoloshe. For some reason it hated him above all the other members of the family. It would take great delight in destroying his schoolbooks and homework, until the boy was forced to leave everything at school. At night it would pinch him to keep him awake, or rattle cupboard doors to create a noise.

[ad#ad-1]

The family members would often wake up at night with their bodies smeared in petroleum jelly, hand lotions, shampoo and other substances. Even more strangely, they reported that on occasion they would wake up and find themselves outside the house!

The desperate family sought the help of an “nyanga” (African Witch Doctor) and a local pastor. After some time, these strange attacks finally stopped and they were never troubled again.

What exactly is a “tokoloshe”? To many westerners this story sounds like poltergeist activity, but to the average South African, a tokoloshe is a whole lot stranger.

Originally the tokoloshe was a kind of water sprite, but this perception has changed to it being a familiar or household spirit belonging to a witch or witchdoctor.

A tokoloshe is usually described as being a brown, hairy dwarf ranging in height from about 20cm to 1 meter. Although usually naked, it is sometimes reported to be wearing a cloak of some kind. Its voice is usually soft and in most accounts it speaks with a lisp.

The tokoloshe is said to have only one buttock and an exceptionally long penis. In fact, it is so long that it has to be slung over his shoulder. As it is so well endowed, one of its functions is to sexually satisfy its witch controller. It also has a fondness of raping women while they sleep.

The witchdoctor often pays the tokoloshe with milk and food. As is common in many cultures, a tokoloshe should never be allowed to have salt with its food, as it may

Imperfect victims... and those who refused to leave

Temelkuran had intended to profile a refugee in Istanbul. However, that refugee disappeared. Not long after, Temelkuran herself was forced to disappear, fleeing Istanbul for Zagreb. So Temelkuran turns her pen to her own feelings about exile. She notes with irritation that a page on the UNHCR website titled ″Refugees Who Have Made a Difference″ has ″only twenty profiles listed. ″ And what of the millions of others?

The flight of Rohingya: Muslims from Myanmar to Bangladesh

Seeking refuge: a series of co-ordinated attacks by Rohingya insurgents on Myanmar security forces in the north of Myanmar's Rakhine State triggered a crackdown by Myanmar forces that has sent a stream of Rohingya villagers fleeing to Bangladesh. About 400 people have been killed in the clashes in Buddist-majority Myanmar

Mass evacuation: a Rohingya man passes a child though a barbed wire border fence on the border with Bangladesh. Myanmar accused the Rohingya insurgents of torching seven villages, one outpost, and two parts of Maungdaw town

Buddhist refugees on their way south: the crackdown by Myanmar forces also sparked a mass evacuation of thousands of Buddhist residents of the area. Tension has long been high between the Rohingya Muslims and Rakhine Buddhists, leading to bloody rioting in 2012. Rakhine Buddhists, feeling unsafe after the upsurge in fighting, are moving south to the state's capital, Sittwe, where Buddhists are a majority and have greater security

No entry: Bangladeshi border guards block people from crossing. Thousands of Rohingyas have sought to flee the fighting to Bangladesh, with nearly 30,000 crossing over. Bangladesh, which is already host to more than 400,000 Rohingya said it will not accept any more refugees, despite an appeal by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for Dhaka to allow Rohingya to seek safety

Humanitarian crisis: an aid worker with an international agency in Bangladesh reports: "what we're seeing is that many Rohingya people are sick. This is because they got stuck in the border before they could enter. It's mostly women and children." The Rohingya are denied citizenship in Myanmar and classified as illegal immigrants, despite claiming roots there that go back centuries

Votaw, now an executive vice president of the PGA Tour, will be loaned out from that post over the next 15 months to represent seven of the bigger hitters in the game: both the American and European tours, Royal & Ancient, LPGA, U.S. Golf Association, PGA of America and Augusta National Golf Club, home of the Masters.

"The time is right for the world of golf to come together for the common good of the sport," Votaw said.

The IOC will decide in October 2009 on possible changes in the Olympic program at the same meeting where it picks the next host city for the Summer Games. The 2016 finalists are Chicago, Tokyo, Rio de Janeiro and Madrid.

Golf hasn't been an Olympic sport since 1904, but a news conference that also featured PGA commissioner Tim Finchem, European tour executive director George O'Grady, and R&A chief executive Peter Dawson showed those at the top are firmly committed to getting back in the Games.

"There's much to be done, and some stiff competition, but we do feel we're putting together the right organization to get the job done," Dawson said.

Six other sports are vying to get on the 2016 program, including two  baseball and softball  that will be played at the Beijing Games next month. They were dropped for the 2012 London Games, but have petitioned to get back in the Olympics four years later.

The other candidates are rugby, roller sports, squash and karate. The IOC is only expected to add a maximum of two new sports for 2016.

While men's golf already has four major tournaments a year, not to mention the Ryder Cup (U.S. vs. Europe) and Presidents Cup (U.S. vs. the rest of the world) in alternate years, Finchem said getting onto the Olympic program is vital to golf's development.

He cited "the incredible impact it could potentially have on growing the game around the world, particularly in areas that are fledgling in their current development of the game."

Finchem acknowledged that some players have been cool to the idea of adding another major event to their already crowded schedules, floating the idea that it should be a competition for amateurs. But there's no way the IOC will consider golf unless it offers up the top professionals for both men and women.

The best of those is

It was conducted by 15 researchers who are part of the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network and published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The study looked at lakes in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Ontario, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin. Quebec and the Atlantic provinces were left out because they didn't have enough long-term lake data to be included in the study.

The research did not include the Great Lakes, which have already been the subject of multiple studies.

The researchers looked measurements of chloride (salt) levels in lakes that have been collected by federal, provincial and state governments for a least a decade.

They compared that data with remote lakes that aren't close to roads.

"Almost all of the lakes situated near a major roadway showed long-term increases in chloride concentrations," said Dugan.

"When you think about road salt being thrown down on roads or sidewalks or parking lots, once that road salt is applied in the environment, it's not removed. It's either stored in the soil or it's going to be flushed into nearby streams and rivers and lakes."

"So any road salt is eventually going to end up in our waters."

Dugan points to Ontario's Lake Simcoe as example. In the 1970s, the large lake had a salt concentration of 10 micrograms of chloride per litre of water. It's now 50 micrograms per litre — a fivefold increase.

"Lake Simcoe is huge, it covers 750 square kilometres, and so you can imagine that if we are talking about a small lake, one that's only a kilometre or less in area, you can rapidly increase chloride concentration over one hundredfold what its background concentration would be."

The study predicted that if the results were extrapolated to all the water bodies in the North American lakes region, about 7,770 would be at serious risk.

Saltier lakes can affect the entire water ecosystem, from the fish to the invertebrates they eat to tiny plankton. Salt can also make the lake more susceptible to invasive species and harmful forms of algae. Dugan said it takes a lot of salt to kill a lake, but a small amount can make it sick.

It's estimated that 23 million tonnes of salt based de-icer are applied to North American roads every year. Environment Canada estimates that between 1½ and four million tonnes are used in Canada every winter,

only-changed - all changed components will be rebuilt. This means that all components,
regardless of what happened in previous batches, will be reused if they haven't been changed.
This strategy is a compromise between all and changed-and-after.

To configure the rebuild strategies in MBS, you may configure the following options:

rebuild_strategy - a string of the rebuild strategy to use by default. This defaults to
changed-and-after.

rebuild_strategy_allow_override - a boolean that determines if a user is allowed to specify
the rebuild strategy they want to use when submitting a module build. This defaults to False.

rebuild_strategies_allowed - a list of rebuild strategies that are allowed to be used. This
only takes effect if rebuild_strategy_allow_override is set to True. This defaults to
allowing all rebuild strategies that MBS supports.

Module build state query

Once created, the client can query the current build state by requesting the
build task's URL.

GET /module-build-service/1/module-builds/1042

The response, if the task exists, would include various pieces of information
about the referenced build task.

time_modified - Zulu ISO 8601 timestamp of when the module build was last modified.

time_submitted - Zulu ISO 8601 timestamp of when the module build was submitted.

version - the module build's version.

Listing all module builds

The list of all tracked builds and their states can be obtained by
querying the "module-builds" resource.
There are a number of configurable GET parameters to change how the
module builds are displayed. These parameters are:

verbose - Shows the builds with additional detail such as the modulemd
and state trace (i.e. verbose=True). This value defaults to False.

short - Shows the builds with a minimum amount of information
(i.e. short=True). This value defaults to False.

page - Specifies which page should be displayed (e.g. page=3). This
value defaults to 1.

per_page - Specifies how many items per page should be displayed
(e.g. per_page=20). This value defaults to 10.

According to the UN: “There are considerable differences in women’s and men’s access to and opportunities to exert power over economic structures in their societies. In most parts of the world, women are virtually absent from or are poorly represented in economic decision-making, including the formulation of financial, monetary, commercial and other economic policies, as well as tax systems and rules governing pay.”

Readings

Using the Human Development Reports, available online at http://hdr.undp.org/en/ and other sources from national and international organizations, your team will write a short report (about 1000 words). In this report, for your selected country, your team will consider progress or setbacks of women, for the last 20 years, in general aspects of employment. Tables from the 2014 Human Development Report to be considered include:

Tables 1, 3, 4, 5 and 9. Use similar tables from other reports, as appropriate, in particular the 2011 Human Development Report and

the 2013 Human Development Report.

Other useful source to be used as a guide in updating information:

Neft, N. and A.D. Levine. 1997. Where Women Stand: An International Report on the Status of Women in 140 Countries. New York: Random House.

Your team should consider:

1. The examination of the Gender Inequality Index for your selected country, as explanations of gender disparities in employment

2. The economic activity by sector and by gender

3. The labor force participation rate

4. Gender differences in earnings

5. Is maternity leave offered?

6. Is child care provided subsidized by the government?

7. What are the gender differences in levels of unemployment

8. Child labor

9. Satisfaction with job

10. Any other issue of relevance

Supplement the data from the Human Development Reports with other national and international sources.

Update: Overnight I decided I should add to this post that I have discussed with Julie Moos the possibility of being a part-time contributor to Poynter in the plan to replace Romenesko (who had already decided to end his full-time employment with Poynter at the end of the year).

I did not apply for the full-time position replacing Romenesko, but said I might consider being a part-time contributor to the Romenesko blog. I had not disclosed those discussions with my bosses at Digital First Media, Jim Brady and John Paton, until this morning, because I had no details for which to ask their approval. I don’t know whether Poynter will want me to become a regular paid contributor, whether I would accept or whether Jim and John would approve the arrangement (I would not accept without their approval). But I think I should disclose the discussions at this point.

Um, you can’t copy complete sentences from someone, embed a link at the end and call that sufficient attribution. If you copy more than a few words from someone, they HAVE to be in quotation marks or in a blockquote. It’s not just an issue of punctuation, as if he misplaced a few commas. As Moos wrote, “One danger of this practice is that the words may appear to belong to Jim when they in fact belong to another.”

Your blog post is really badly misleading, mendacious even, because Poynter did not “call it plagiarism.” The headline of her piece was carefully worded: “Questions over Romenesko’s attributions spur changes in writing, editing.” Yes, she quoted a four-sentence statement of ethics that did include the word “plagiarism.” But that is far from “calling it plagiarism” and you should correct your headline.

I have enjoyed Mr. Romenesko’s work too. But not attributing is wrong when the Huffington Post does it and it’s wrong when the Poynter Institute does it.

Derek, thanks for your comment. I agree that Romenesko — and anyone — should use quotation marks when using someone’s exact words.

I strongly resent your statement that my blog post was “badly misleading, mendacious even.” Mendacious is defined in Dictionary

Apples. New Zealand objected in strong terms to the length of time Australia
is taking to accept its apples and the repeated demands for information for
new risk assessments over fireblight. New Zealand Ambassador Crawford
Falconer personally made the complaint, referring to his country’s 80-year
attempt to gain access. He accused Australia of doing everything to “delay,
prevaricate and frankly to prevent our trade.” Supported by the US and EU,
New Zealand said the recent WTO dispute ruling in the
US-Japan apples case showed
that mature apples do not spread fireblight. “Yes the countries involved are
different, but the science is not,” Amb.Falconer said.

Australia said the latest risk assessment is open for comment until 30 March
and encouraged all concerned to supply scientific information and to express
any other concerns. It said it would continue to work bilaterally with New
Zealand.

Other issues. Also discussed were various concerns about a number of
countries’ measures on bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or mad cow
disease), a review of the EU’s animal health policy and private sector
standards. See full list below.

A report to the General Council is due by the end of 2006. In the discussion
that took place in October and in an informal session on 30 January, members
differed on how to deal with this. The current focus is on proposals from
groups of developing countries and work envisaged in the committee’s 30 June
2005 report to the General Council (the 13-page
G/SPS/35,
which includes the proposals). Some of these developing countries said they
plan to revise their proposals, but added that revision is difficult without
counterproposals from other countries.

The committee’s 2005 report (G/SPS/35) includes a number of
points that members have agreed should be “initial elements” for their
further discussion (paragraph 43). Several members urged the committee to
move ahead with these practical actions to help developing countries.

On one question members did agree: they will postpone their review of the
procedure to enhance transparency of special and differential treatment (G/SPS/33)
until the first meeting in 2008. This procedure was agreed in October 2004;

“The Cedi’s appreciation against the U.S Dollar could render the marginal increment in prices of finished products on the international market negligible to be passed on to the final consumer. Whereas Gasoline went up 1.24% and Gasoil shot up 0.09%, the market could play out favourably for consumers because of the gain of 1.15% the Cedi recorded against the U.S Dollar,” the IES said in a statement.

The IES also noted that it was “possible for some Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) to reduce their prices in order to maintain or expand their market share in line with market realities as Frimps Oil did in the last window.”

Below are details of the statement:

Local Fuel Market Performance

Prices of petroleum products did not experience any movements within the first pricing-window of May 2019.

The window saw Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) selling Gasoline and Gasoil at an average price of Ghc5.24 and Ghc5.22 respectively.

It must be noted that whereas prices remained largely unchanged across board, some OMCs, such as Frimps Oil reviewed their prices downwards to compete for larger market share.

As a result, Frimps Oil, Benab Oil and Pacific Oil sell the least-priced fuel on the market relative to other OMCs per IES Market-Scan.

They are followed by Star Oil and SO Energy.

World Oil Market

Geopolitical developments around the world continue to weigh on the oil market putting traders in readiness for any eventuality, including but not limited to Iran’s possible withdrawal from the 2015 Nuclear deal, Venezuela’s U.S sanction effects, and the final outcome of the back-and-forth U.S-China trade talks.

Iran says its nuclear compliance is contingent on 1.5 mb/d oil exports, which U.S hopes to cut down to zero.

Iran told EU diplomats that it needs to export as much as 1.5 mb/d in order for it to stay in the 2015 nuclear deal, while U.S warns “there will be consequences” should Iran resume nuclear activities.

On the trade talks, U.S and China have imposed over 260 billion worth of tariffs on each other’s goods and services as outcome of talks remains unpredictable.

In the midst of these developments, the oil market, to the surprise of Analysts, saw average Brent Crude

Public Opinion Strategies helped us to clarify what we wanted to learn and then conducted research and analysis that shed light even beyond the questions we set out to ask. They were very receptive to our suggestions, responsive to our queries, and flexible when we needed them to be.

Public Opinion Strategies has consistently offered unparalleled advice and spot-on polling that has shaped how and where we spent money and deploy key resources. Additionally, they have always been an excellent steward of limited campaign resources, ensuring we spend wisely and not a dollar more than necessary in order to get the information we need.

Robert Blizzard and Public Opinion Strategies did a great job for us throughout our successful campaign for Congress. Robert gave us accurate data, spot on analysis, and professional advice, all of which were essential to our victory.

Public Opinion Strategies is one of our go-to pollsters when it comes to testing public support for bond ballot measures and other initiative proposals. They are available to provide ongoing consultation with regard to crafting of ballot questions, public outreach messaging, and related efforts.

ACLI has worked with Public Opinion Strategies for decades, through several tough industry battles—often ones in which public opinion does not naturally fall on the side of insurers. Yet Bill and his team consistently provide invaluable strategic advice by refining our messages and helping us frame our issues in a way that makes them understandable and persuasive.

The data from Public Opinion Strategies provided important insight and informed our public awareness campaign. We sincerely appreciate their professionalism and expertise in this arena.

Nicole McCleskey and the team at Public Opinion Strategies have been invaluable to me, both during my campaigns and as Governor of the State of New Mexico. It’s not just the accuracy of their numbers, but guiding the overall strategy that makes them so valuable.

Public Opinion Strategies has been a part of our team in Missouri for more than a decade. With their data and guidance, Republicans here were able to attain a majority in the House in 2002 for the first time in fifty years, and we have been able to grow that majority to the point that we now have a record, veto-proof majority.

Under Mohammad Reza, the nationalization of the oil industry was nominally maintained, although in 1954 Iran entered into an agreement to split revenues with a newly formed international consortium that was responsible for managing production. With U.S. assistance Mohammad Reza then proceeded to carry out a national development program, called the White Revolution, that included construction of an expanded road, rail, and air network, a number of dam and irrigation projects, the eradication of diseases such as malaria, the encouragement and support of industrial growth, and land reform. He also established a literacy corps and a health corps for the large but isolated rural population. In the 1960s and ’70s the shah sought to develop a more independent foreign policy and established working relationships with the Soviet Union and eastern European nations.

The White Revolution solidified domestic support for the shah, but he faced continuing political criticism from those who felt that the reforms did not move far or fast enough and religious criticism from those who believed westernization to be antithetical to Islam. Opposition to the shah himself was based upon his autocratic rule, corruption in his government, the unequal distribution of oil wealth, forced westernization, and the activities of Savak (the secret police) in suppressing dissent and opposition to his rule. These negative aspects of the shah’s rule became markedly accentuated after Iran began to reap greater revenues from its petroleum exports beginning in 1973. Widespread dissatisfaction among the lower classes, the Shīʿite clergy, the bazaar merchants, and students led in 1978 to the growth of support for the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, a Shīʿite religious leader living in exile in Paris. Rioting and turmoil in Iran’s major cities brought down four successive governments; on January 16, 1979, the shah left the country, and Khomeini assumed control. Although the shah did not abdicate, a referendum resulted in the declaration on April 1, 1979, of an Islamic republic in Iran. The shah traveled to Egypt, Morocco, The Bahamas, and Mexico before entering the United States on October 22, 1979, for medical treatment of lymphatic cancer. Two weeks later Iranian militants seized the U.S. embassy in Tehrān and took hostage more than 50 Americans, demanding the extradition of the shah in return for the hostages’ release. Extradition was refused, but the shah later left for Panama and then Cairo, where he was granted asylum

Some veteran House members say it’s unrealistic to think that even a freshman class of 87 Republicans, most of whom have tea party backing, can make a significant impact in their first term.

“They are raring to go,” said five-term Rep. Jim Gerlach, R-Pa. But with Democrats controlling the Senate, “we can only do what we can do in the House,” he added.

“We’re going to run a lot of issues up the flagpole and create a lot of national discussion,” he added, acknowledging that may be as far as they get.

Nine-term Rep. Steven LaTourette, R-Ohio, said tea party newcomers who are eager to slash federal spending will soon learn how difficult it is.

“Back in Ohio, almost everybody says, `Oh, you’ve got to cut spending,'” LaTourette said. “But then they say, `Oh, I didn’t know you meant my spending.’ And there’s going to be a lot of that.”

Deep spending cuts would anger many interest groups, and Republicans may pay a price, he said.

Republicans picked up nearly three dozen House seats when Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980, LaTourette noted.

“Half of them were shown the door two years later,” he said. “Not because they did anything wrong. They kept their promises. But when you’ve got to cut a lot of money out of the budget, everybody’s got a pet program, a pet disease, a pet something, and people are going to get fired up.”

Indeed, the House’s new Republican speaker, John Boehner, another Ohioan, is moving cautiously. When NBC asked him to name a federal program he’s willing to cut, Boehner replied, “I don’t think I have one off the top of my head, but there is no part of this government that should be sacred.”

The quote from Spencer, the one from Rothbard, and the comparison of choice and aggression regarding free markets versus the state all seemed worthwhile to me. Food for thought and consideration… sorry you couldn’t find any value there.

C’mon, the imposition of order by a government leads to aggression? That is such a breathtakingly expansive assumption, and one with no possibility of demonstrating (much less proving) any documentable cause and effect, that it has no

The analogy may be inexact, but I hope you get my point.Edited 2011-09-14 03:03 UTCWed, 14 Sep 2011 02:55:00 GMTdonotreply@osnews.com (Alfman)CommentsRE[12]: I'd be eternally grateful to Russiahttp://www.osnews.com/thread?489462

I can't provide an answer which would satisfy all cases, but plenty of software performs a "click wrap" acknowledgement of a license in order to install.

...

It is debatable whether an implied license can take precedent over an explicit one. However even if it does, the requirements are right there on the box. An "implied license" would mean that the explicit license must allow the user to install the software on systems fulfilling the requirements, nothing more is implied.

More to the point would be the question "how can an explicit license include terms which break consumer protection laws"?

The answer would be "they can't". An OEM merely writing some conditions on a EULA does not make said conditions legal, the OEM still has to obey the law.

The "implied license" laws say, in essence, that when you buy a piece of hardware, it becomes your property. As long as it remains your property, you have full property rights over it, you may use it however you wish. You have every permission that may be required to use it. You may even use completely contrary to the original maker's intent, if you wish.

For example, if you buy a nail, instead of using it to join together two pieces of wood, you can use it to hang a

Somehow, knitting doesn’t go well for me right now. I wanted to knit the Bonsai shawl for me, but somehow I messed up the stitch count in one of the first rows were beads are involved which I wanted to substitute with nupps … And now I don’t have the nerve to sort that out.

Then I started a little striped hat to use up leftovers but didn’t want to knit that (luckily I noticed that before I was several cms in …) …

Plus now, there is a secret item I am knitting (and that I am most likely NOT finish in time). Since I have been so busy with university work lately, there wasn’t much free time …

Don’t worry about me, I’ll be posting soon again. I’m using up leftovers now with a Minimaniac Scarf and try to remember which row I have to purl and which to knit …

I guess I have lost my knitting mojo a bit at the moment.

Sorry that there are no pictures, but maybe I can write soon again! If not, see ya’ll next week and have a great time until then!

I am sorry that I was quiet for so long, but somehow, I had a very strange mixture of stuff-to-do and free time and didn’t get round to blogging …

As I said in the last blog post, I recently took part in the “Flash your stash!”-thread in one of the ravelry forums. After looking at amazing quantities of yarn (the “amazing” reffering to both the yarn and the size of certain stashes), I decided that I’d get my stash out to see it all in one place.

Ultra High Strength Steel - Low Alloy

700MC/100XF/110XF

These extra high strength structural steel grades offer excellent bendability, weldability and cutting properties. The extra high strength steel grades are used in applications such as truck chassis, cranes and earthmoving machines. In these applications, the high strength of the steels is used to save weight and/or to increase the payload. As a result of this and the good formability of the steels, the total costs can be reduced.

The miracles idea is kind of iffy, just because both good and evil are granted certain abilities in the Bible. Granted, the idea behind everything is that even though evil has powers, good very much trumps evil in the end, and is more powerful. But if going with the idea that a miracle is a supernatural occurrence, then it can go either way in terms of what it proves.

The biggest one that's tripping me up is casting out devils in Jesus' name, especially when comparing that idea to Matthew 12: 22-28. I don't want to type it all out, but I do want to focus on the last part. Jesus has just cast out a devil, and the Pharisees say that Jesus is doing so by the power of Beelzebub. Jesus responds: "Every kingdom divided against itself goes to ruin; and no town, no household that is divided against itself cant stand. And if it is Satan who cats out Satan, Satan is divided against himself; how then can his kingdom stand? And if it is by Beelzebub that I cast out devils, by whom do your own people drive them out?"

I've always read the italicized part as Satan can't drive out devils, because then Satan is working against himself. The only way to truly drive out a devil is due to the power of God. And so if you are driving out a devil, you are doing so specifically according to the will of the Father. This would be one of the "markers" identifying who is truly following Jesus.

Yet the people in Matthew 7 use that as a marker, and Jesus says he never knew them. But how can that be possible, if the only way to drive out the devils is through the power of God? Then Jesus should know the people, because they are actively doing the will of God. Otherwise, why would God grant them the power to drive out the devils?

Right now, the only way I see around the Matthew 7 verse is that what the people did wasn't "valid." They didn't truly prophesy or drive out devils, they only thought they did. Except I think that's applying outside perspectives to the text, because based on the passage alone, the people sound sincere. Jesus doesn't say why he didn't know them (other than the implication that they didn't do the will of the Father. Except the will of the Father is what allows one to

“Charlie gave us a check and a couple of airplanes and said, ‘Make it work’. He didn’t say, ‘This is the way it’s going to be,'” Chmiel recalled. He’s grateful to Turner for giving him that chance. “He gave me an opportunity that not many other people would have given me. He’s been fantastic to work for.”

The couple has kept their heads above water, a feat for anyone in the FBO business these days. He credits his wife with much of the success of their business.

“Angela is very important to this business. She’s the financial director; she’s the boss,” he says. “I couldn’t do her job. We’ve been working together, side-by-side, 24/7, for the last 14 years. We’ve raised a family and raised a business, and that part is cool. I can’t imagine not working with her.”

They’ve developed constructive relationships with community leaders and have taken on the role as airport manager. Due to their positive relationships, there’s very little airport adversity. He gives monthly reports to the local airport commission and shares the information that’s important to them, like how much fuel is flowing, if the hangars are filled and estimated figures for airport operations. He’s specific when naming the corporations that are using the airport. Chmiel’s opinion is that it’s very beneficial when local politicians know exactly what’s going on at the airport, in order to garner their support.

As a Wausau resident, Chmiel looks at airport projects from both sides of the coin. He’ll often ask himself how his neighbors might react to an airport proposal. He tries to keep all airport projects on a proactive, rather than emergency, basis.

“As a taxpayer in the city of Wausau, I ask for reasonable projects, like perimeter fencing, trimming trees on approach ends of runways and pavement maintenance,” he explained. “The airport committee knows what’s coming up. Most projects are part of our six-year plan.”

Wisely, Chmiel has also developed favorable relationships with the media. They call on him when aviation issues come up and have reported on several airport events, such as Young Eagles flights and events of historical significance.

Wausau Flying Service concentrates on three areas: managing the airport, fuel flow

Insulin is only recommended for individuals for type 2 diabetics when they have not been able to get blood sugars low enough to prevent complications through other means. To avoid insulin, those with this health condition should work very hard to follow a healthy eating plan that includes a lot of vegetables and lean proteins, exercise every day, and keep stress in perspective. They also should take their oral drugs regularly. It can be difficult to follow these recommendations and the help of your doctor, nutritionist, diabetes educator, health coach, or integrative medicine practitioner may be helpful. If you who want to avoid taking medicine, work with health professionals who are knowledgeable about lifestyle medicine, and can help you understand how to fit the changes into your life.

Given the diverse peculiarities involving the issue, studies have shown that Diabetes mellitus has been extensively investigated in its pathophysiological aspects, highlighting the search for strong evidence that can be used in the clinical practice of the Primary Care nurse, with attributions focused on health promotion, prevention of complications, treatment and rehabilitation of the health of individuals and community, carried out in an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary manner (Matumoto, Fortuna, Kawata, Mishima, & Pereira, 2011; Florianopolis, 2015).

Patients who suffer from diabetes have a lifelong struggle to attain and maintain blood glucose levels as close to the normal range as possible. With appropriate blood sugar control, the risk of both microvascular (small blood vessel) and neuropathic (nerve) complications is decreased markedly. Additionally, if hypertension (high blood pressure) and hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol) are treated promptly and aggressively, the risk of cardiovascular complications should decrease as well.

There is no single gene that “causes” type 1 diabetes. Instead, there are a large number of inherited factors that may increase an individual’s likelihood of developing diabetes. This is known as multifactorial inheritance. The genes implicated in the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus control the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system. This system is involved in the complex process of identifying cells which are a normal part of the body, and distinguishing them from foreign cells, such as those of bacteria or viruses. In an autoimmune disease such as diabetes mellitus, this system makes a mistake in identifying the normal ‘self’ cells as ‘foreign’, and attacks the body.

When you have diabetes, excess sugar (glucose) builds up in your blood. Your kidneys are forced to work overtime to filter and absorb the excess sugar. If

When disaster strikes, it helps to do a little recon before sending in the big guns. A harbor drone, in development at the University of Hawaii, could help the Coast Guard do just that, without risking personnel or stretching resources.

The Unmanned Port Security Vessel uses video and sonar gear and a mass spectrometer to analyze the shape, size and contents of hazardous materials from natural and environmental disasters.

“There’s interesting potential for a number of things, where it’s like, ‘Hey, a tsunami came through and we want to know, is the [port] channel open?’” said Lt. Jacob Paarlberg, Sector Honolulu Command Center chief. “Rather than driving a giant boat through there and hoping it is ... we could run this little unmanned port security vessel up, and it could see what’s on the bottom for us.”

The UPSV is 6 feet long by 4 ½ feet wide, weighs about 60 pounds and can travel up to 6 knots. It can be easily disassembled and flown via helo.

“One of the things the Coast Guard was interested in was to have something that they didn’t have to have at every port, but if something happened — for instance, here in Hawaii — if something happened over in Hilo, they could put it in a helicopter,” said Brian Bingham, the UPSV developer and a University of Hawaii mechanical engineering professor.

The UPSV’s main function is to collect data through sonar, Bingham said, which allows a response crew to get an idea of the size and shape of something like an oil spill. However, it can be customized for other missions.

“One of the things that’s interesting about the port security vessel is, it has the ability to swap out sensors, depending on what we’re looking for,” Paarlberg said.

Chemical sensors measure temperature, oxygen and salinity levels. A mass spectrometer can measure oil is in the water. And, Paarlberg said, it can take a sample of a chemical or oil spill and trace its path through the water, perhaps to the source of the leak.

The UPSV also has potential for security missions.

“If there’s a threat of an explosive or there’s a mysterious package on a pier, rather than putting anyone in harm’s way, this port vessel can drive up to it,” he said.

It operates in two modes

Grant : I have forever. So I am no help there. But it seems to me a bond investor is almost better off in cash. If you were to go out 10 years in a US treasury security you earn yield of approximate 2%. To remain in cash and be flexible you sacrifice those 2%. The bond market is a desert of value.

Deirdre Bolton : What does this mean for gold?

Grant : The price of gold is the reciprocal of the world's faith in the deeds and words of the likes of Ben Bernanke. The world over, central banks are printing money as it has never been printed before. The European Central Bank has increased the size of its balance sheet at the annual rate of 89%. It's amazing. The Fed is far behind at only 15%. The Bank of England 67% over the past few months. These are rates of increases in the production of paper currencies we have never seen in the modern age. It takes no effort at all. They simply tap the computer screen.

Recession 2012 Means Lower Treasury Yields Says Lacy Hunt

I certainly agree with Grant on gold, but what about the idea a recession is coming in 2012, and if so what does it mean for treasuries?

Lacy Hunt at Hoisington Management in the 4th quarter 2011 review says High Debt Leads to Recession. It's the last paragraph that is of most interest to the treasury bubble debate.

The long end of the Treasury market witnessed a decline in yields from 4.34% at the beginning of 2011 to 2.89% at the end of the year. To most, this 35% return was a surprise as there was near unanimity of opinion that rates would rise in connection with the higher real economic growth rate that was expected for 2011. Similarly, faster growth seems to be embedded in most rate expectations for 2012, and concomitantly expectations are for interest rates to rise. If recessionary conditions appear in 2012, as we expect, then even lower long-term interest rates will be recorded.

There's considerable time and money being put into building a substantial fence along the US-Mexico border. Environmentalists had succeeded in delaying sectors that could harm the environment, so Congress gave the Department of Homeland Security permission to waive any law that stood in its way.

Host Lisa Mullins talks with Richard Marosi, staff writer for the L.A. Times, about an elaborate tunnel discovered between Tijuana, Mexico and San Diego earlier this week. The tunnel was used to smuggle marijuana into the United States.

Mexico built tens of thousands of suburban houses to support a home-owning boom, with the hope that cities would expand around these communities. But it's not working out that way. Now the country has 600,000 abandoned homes.

Ceci Bastida has made music in Mexico and the US, and her latest work is something of a heads-up to both. It focuses on the violence — gun violence, mass shootings — that are too common in both countries. But not all of her songs are quite that dark.

Mexico's battle against drug traffickers is looking increasingly like a real war. The Mexican Army is involved, and traffickers are responsing with brazen attacks. The World's Lorne Matalon has the story from Mexico City.

Mitt Romney often talks about his heritage in Mexico, and his faith in the Mormon Church. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints has a complicated history in Mexico -- it's growing rapidly today, but more than 100 years ago it was a place Mormons went to avoid a prohibition on polygamy.

Since the start of President Felipe Calderón drug war in 2006, more than 35,000 people have been killed, countless thousands more remain unaccounted for, many missing for years. Myles Estey reports from Tijuana on the psychological impact of violence.

Rather than ship business to China, more U.S. high tech companies are choosing to setup up factories just across the U.S. border in Mexico. Low-tech businesses have been doing it for decades, but the new arrivals are decidedly different.

Not everybody who serves in the US military is actually an American citizen, but many of them were told they would receive citizenship if they served. Instead, thousands have been deported from the country they say is their real home after committing even minor crimes.

The US-Mexico border crossing near San Diego is one of the frontlines in the battle against illegal

Alienated ‘angry’ Muslim youth no mystery

This is an image obtained by The Associated Press which shows an unidentified detainee standing on a box with a bag on his head and wires attached to him in this late 2003 file photo at the Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad, Iraq.

GULF NEWS – Obama’s ‘soft’ intervention is a nonstarter in the region given the West’s insensitivity towards addressing the hopelessness and humiliation that Muslims have suffered.

Interventionism is once more permeating American foreign-policy thinking in the Middle East. This time around, however, it is ‘soft’ intervention, although it is laden with the same kind of language and misleading references. But it seems that the American government has learned so very little since the last botched effort at remaking the Middle East to its liking.

On June 26, the White House asked Congress for $1.5 billion to bolster ‘stability’ in Syria’s neighbours — Jordan, Iraq, Lebanon and Turkey. A third of that amount will be dedicated to train ‘moderate’ Syrian rebels for the purpose of fighting the Syrian army and its allies on one hand and holding back the growing influence of militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) on the other. The ISIL is in control of large parts of Iraq.[…]Indeed, it was the US-led western invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq that drew the battle lines in the Middle East like never before — lines that the Americans, and now the Israelis, are desperately attempting to redraw. However, policymakers, no matter how astute, often forget — or rather ignore — the underlining reasons behind violent phenomena. Even worse, they exploit the violence to further their political and strategic interests, despite the fact that it means more violence.

When Baghdad fell in April 2003, and as American soldiers so conceitedly drowned Baghdad with their flags, millions of already alienated and angry Arab and Muslim youth felt that their countries had reached the lowest depths of humiliation…

The Score3-0 to United. Welbeck, Anderson and Rooney getting the goals for us today.

The Breakdown

CLEVERLEY! First real moment of excietment came from him as he stretched Friedel with a low shot from outside the box.

De Gea gets the ball late just under 15 minutes in with van der Vaart coming in quick. He does a drag back and falls over.

20th minute guess what. A low shot is taken by Bale and it's saved by de Gea. Screw you critics.

Evans with a ridiculously soft booking on 36'. High five ref!

Good start to the second half, motivational speech maybe?

"Here's Cleverley, and he's tried a clever ball."

C-c-combo breaker! Shot by Anderson blocked by Friedel and Rooney follows up with another. Shame Friedel was up to it.

CLEVERLEY TO WELBECK! A great, strong ball into the box by Cleverley is followed up by a confident header by Welbeck into the bottom corner of Friedel's net. 61'

Free kick done well by Rooney, but again a great save from Friedel. 64'

Jones pulls off a Rambo like dive to block Bale's shot. This included an action roll.

What. a. goal. It starts with de Gea's sweet ball to Young who runs with it before feeding it to Rooney. Rooney taps it to Anderson who plays a great ball in to Welbeck who backheels it first time into space for Anderson to run on to and he sidefoots it home with about 15 minutes left.

Season debuts for Giggs, Park, and Chicharito as they replace Young, Cleverley, and Welbeck on the 81st minute.

Ever since then, I’ve been fascinated and a little obsessed with all things miniature, particularly 1:12 scale.

Since I learned to knit and crochet, I knew I wanted to make miniatures. Of course minis are significantly harder and I failed over and over as a beginner to make successful minis. I’ve finally gotten down to the scale I want though and have even dared to dream smaller now! Check out this hat I made last summer:

I made this hat from a Buttercup Miniatures pattern. I did modify the stranded section of the hat to make it look more like my childhood winter cap. I worked on 6/0 (.75mm) knitting needles and used a single strand of 6 strand DMC embroidery floss as my yarn. DMC floss makes great miniature knitting yarn and the color selection is nearly unlimited and highly affordable! Someday, I’d love to order some of Buttercup Miniatures super fine knitting needles. My smallest are only 6/0 needles (.75mm). I’d love to try out their .38mm, .55mm, and.60mm size double-pointed knitting needles and fine ‘yarns’ just to see how much smaller I can really go.

My big goal for 2014 is to publish one new pay-per-download pattern per month so I’ll have income to pay for things like utilities once my home is built and I have a place to live and work again! For January’s new pattern, think small! I’m working on something which would be right at home in a little girl’s dollhouse, tucked into bed with her barbie, or snuck into the corner of a whatnot shelf for us adult collectors. Of course I know most of you don’t want to work quite as small as I enjoy working, so this pattern is being designed with fingering weight yarn in mind. Of course your finished project would still be flat out adorable in a DK or worsted weight yarn. Made in a thicker yarn, this knit would still be a great accessory item for a 18″ American Girl doll. Keep an eye out! This upcoming pattern is only the first in a series of at least four new miniature knit patterns! Additionally, this pattern will be published in two versions, one worked in the round, and one worked flat!

Really shocked to read a news yesterday about the honor killing of a girl by nearly a dozen members of her family. Which world are we still living in? The members involved also include the girl's mother. That is something which can shake anyone's conscience. In this age when we talk of equality for the girl child, hearing great success stories of girls, girls taking active participation in every walks of life, hearing something like this makes us numb. Are we really developing as a nation or still juggling with the horrors of unholy crimes. Honor killing is a crime. Every girl has the right to choose a partner of her choice once she is matured. I guess its high time the parents realize this and do away with the age old customs and beliefs of caste, creed etc when deciding for a groom for the girl. Honor killing does not kill the person, it kills humanity. No religion teaches honor killing. Its high time the government takes severe action and punishes the culprits to set a precedent that nobody else can even think of committing such a heinous crime. We do not want to hang our heads in shame in modern India hearing such inhumane crime.

Very sad over that happenings. Honor killing is worst action taken by those who cannot cope up with their own decision against the consciousness and also fear of facing the society in future. It is a crime which cannot be pardoned and may even set as precedent to others who are not able to take decisions in their favor due to pressure from outside. Life is to life against all odds. By the way people are not that strict and they can always listen to those who can talk sense and put forth their view point in right perspective. If death is the reason , then many problems gets unsolved and would remain a mystery for ever without any solution.K Mohan'Idhuvum Kadandhu Pogum "Even this challenging situation would ease

The fact that its even happening in cities where people are more educated than the villages or small towns is shocking. We have heard many stories of honor killings in the villages where a khap panchayat used to even pronounce such shocking judgements. Its high time the government and the law takes a strict action against such heinous crimes. We as a nation would be ashamed in international community too if such a news comes out. Its time to wake up.

It hurts our feelings when we hear such news. We say we are all well educated and we are civilised we feel. But this

After a tough bogey on 11, Champ played it safe on 13, choosing to lay up with an iron rather than hit driver and risk an awkward approach shot to a pin only five paces onto the green. The decision cost him, however, as a poor second shot put him in a greenside bunker and he could not get up and down, while Hansen and Baxter made birdies. The bogey dropped Champ to 6 under, tied with Yang in the group in front of him.

Yang, however, made a costly double bogey on 16, a par 4 which played almost 500 yards, followed by a bogey on 17. The mistakes dropped him to 3 under, and he could not recover.

The last five holes were a grind for the final group, as Hansen made the only birdie by getting up and down on the drivable par-4 15th.

Showing off his deft scrambling skills, Champ punched out of the trees on 16 after an errant tee shot, leaving himself a chip from the front of the green.

“There was a very small gap, about 15 feet wide,” Champ explained about his approach shot. “I just missed [the tree]. If you saw a replay, I probably missed it by a foot.”

With Baxter, his playing partner who was only a stroke behind, facing a very makable birdie putt, Champ almost knocked in his ensuing chip and left himself an easy par. Baxter, meanwhile, watched his birdie putt slide by the hole.

Baxter proceeded to bogey the 17th hole, and Champ walked to the 18th tee with a two-stroke lead in his pocket. After a 325-yard drive that split the fairway, it seemed the tournament was all but over, but Champ left his approach to the right of the green, barely missing the cart path and out-of-bounds behind the green.

With Hansen on the green putting for birdie, a two-stroke swing between the two would have forced a playoff. Champ went on to knock his pitch to 8 feet, and Hansen missed his 40-footer.

Finally the pressure was off. Only needing a two-putt to win, Champ finished the tournament in style, as he drained the putt and received a much deserved ovation from the 200-person gallery.

Champ first played in the Memorial Amateur at the age of 11. Tournament Director John Rochelle has

13 October 2010: The Climate Information for Development in Africa (ClimDev-Africa) programme was officially launched on 13 October 2010, during the Seventh African Development Forum (ADF) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

This session is organized by the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and the Regional Office for Europe of the World Health Organization (WHO). Delegates are scheduled to discuss, inter alia: ratification and implementation of the Protocol; development of national strategies on water and health by setting targets and target dates; surveillance of and response to water-related disease; how to ensure water supply and sanitation in extreme weather events; the specific challenges of small-scale water supply systems; equitable access to drinking water; and access to information and public participation under the Protocol. In addition, MOP 2 to the Protocol is expected to adopt the Guidance on Water Supply and Sanitation in Extreme Weather Events, which were elaborated by the parties to the Protocol under the leadership of Italy.

This Expert Group Meeting (EGM) is organized by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA). It aims to take stock and exchange experiences of Arab countries, as well as that of regional and international organizations, on climate change modeling methodologies, tools, model projections, downscaling techniques and knowledge gaps, as well as ways in which vulnerability can be assessed in view of better understanding the effects of climate change on sustainable development in the Arab region.

2 October 2010: The Sixth Ministerial Conference on Environment and Development in Asia and the Pacific (MCED-6), which took place in Astana, Kazakhstan, from 27 September-2 October 2010, concluded with the endorsement of the Astana Declaration and regional implementation plan, and the Green Bridge Initiative to encourage cooperation between the European and Asian regions.

This workshop will focus on cooperation between national and local authorities, industry and civil society in designing, planning, financing and producing legislation to support walking and cycling in cities. It is organized by the Georgian Ministry of Labour, Health and Social Affairs, Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources and Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure and the City of Batumi, with support from other governments through the Pan-European Programme on Transport, Health and Environment (THE PEP) Trust Fund, which is run jointly by the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Europe.

27 September 2010: The sixth Ministerial Conference on Environment

One of our resident chipmunks

The pot of honey and card that arrived on our doorstep between our pre-closing inspection and our return from the lawyer with the ‘keys to the kingdom’ were no one-off. There is a genuine kindness and warmth that seems to characterize our new ‘hood; people take care of each other. There will always be someone willing to share their knowledge or who can help with the things that need doing. And there is something pretty awesome about setting out for an evening paddle and ending up getting to know new neighbours over a beer on their island party deck!

Nestled in the woods just north of Frontenac Provincial Park, Wintergreen is a year-round education and retreat centre. Their focus is education, culture, and the environment and they offer courses and retreat and meeting facilities for individuals and groups.

This last weekend we had the pleasure of staying two nights in the main lodge, a wonderful, off-grid straw-bale building with a green roof. The lodge sits in a meadow, immediately surrounded by flowers, herbs and vegetables with the forest beyond.

Wintergreen’s 204 acres features mixed forests and meadows, granite outcroppings, ponds, marshes, and a glacier carved lake – we managed to explore a good part of this during an awesome two-hour wilderness hike.

I watched a beaver slide into a pond and swim across it, my first certain sighting. Less romantically but no less a landmark, I picked my first tick off my clothing as we sat on the dock by the glacial lake. With ticks increasingly present – even in Toronto this summer – and concerns about Lyme Disease, this is something we all need to know about!

I stopped worrying about sticking to ‘the beaten track’ (sometimes we lost the trail for a while) and soaked up the beauty of the woodland, the lake and ponds, the rock, as we explored, occasionally investigating one of the wilderness cabins (including a hobbit house) that dot the property. We did do a thorough tick inspection when we got back to the lodge, though.

Earlier that day, I had joined thirteen other women in ‘Celebrating the Sacredness of Woman’, a workshop led by Julie Vachon a Metis woman who has studied with

The episode also called into question Speaker John Boehner's control over the House Republican caucus. The speaker, according to multiple accounts, initially favored the two-month extension, which had passed the Senate with an overwhelming bipartisan majority. He was then apparently forced to retreat from that position last weekend in the face of a tea party-fueled revolt in which freshman conservatives in particular demanded an immediate 12-month extension.

In a virtual party-line vote, the House on Tuesday passed a measure calling for the creation of a House-Senate conference committee to consider ways to pay for an immediate year-long continuation. But congressional Democrats and administration officials, noting previous legislative maneuvering over the issue and a looming December 31 deadline, called the House's terms unrealistic and refused to budge.

Top Senate Republicans were also enraged by the actions of their House counterparts, believing that House GOP leaders had backed out of a deal to support the temporary two-month plan. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, was among those who ultimately called for House Republicans to relent.

Facing rising Republican establishment fears that the GOP was squandering its political advantage on taxes, the speaker again reversed himself on Thursday, this time essentially consenting to the Senate's terms.

According to GOP sources, Boehner held a conference call Thursday afternoon with his fellow House Republicans in which the speaker refused to allow any members to ask questions or raise objections. One Republican House member on the call described the speaker as "tired and ticked off."

Boehner, in announcing the deal to reporters later in the day, insisted the House GOP's prior opposition to the Senate plan was the right thing to do, even if it turned out to be politically questionable.

"It may not have been politically the smartest thing in the world," the Ohio Republican conceded, but the end result was "we were able to fix what came out of the Senate."

Boehner also acknowledged the pressure he was under, saying: "I talked to enough members over the last 24 hours who say we don't like the two-month extension and if you can get this fixed, why not do the right thing for the American people even if it's not exactly what we want."

The final bill is virtually same Senate proposal House Republicans rejected earlier this week. House Republicans were given slim political cover through the addition of legislative language designed to ease the administrative burden on small businesses implementing the plan, as well

“Excessive use” of Unlimited Plans resulted in abrupt terminations. Verizon Wireless terminated heavy internet users claiming that the high levels of usage could only have been attained by activities, such as “streaming or downloading movies and video” prohibited by the terms and conditions. These usage restrictions were not clearly and conspicuously disclosed to consumers and directly contradicted the promise of “unlimited” service. Customers found their accounts abruptly terminated for excessive use, leaving them without internet services and unable to obtain refunds for their wireless access cards and cell phones.

From 2004 until April of this year, Verizon Wireless terminated over 13,000 consumers nationwide for “excessive” use of its “unlimited” internet access plans. These customers were subsequently unable to use their Verizon Wireless cell phones and modems to connect to the internet.

Verizon Wireless has agreed to reimburse all terminated consumers for the cost of wireless access cards or cell phones purchased by the consumer in order to utilize Verizon Wireless’s wireless internet service. Verizon Wireless estimates the total amount of restitution to be approximately $1 million nationwide. Verizon Wireless has also agreed to pay penalties and costs of $150,000 to New York State and revise the company’s marketing of its wireless internet access plans.

Verizon Wireless fully and voluntarily cooperated with the Office of the Attorney General throughout this inquiry. Since April of 2007, Verizon Wireless has voluntarily ceased cutting off customers based on their data usage and no longer prohibits common internet uses.

I have extremely favorable ratings regarding Verizon Wireless BroadbandAccess. The speed of the system has been great over the many years I have used it. Lately, whenever I am on the service, I feel uncomfortable. Why? Because I know the company promotes an “unlimited” plan but if you exceed 5 gigabytes of downloads per month they shut down your service.

\n

In addition the company’s terms of service specify you cannot stream media or use VoIP on their BroadbandAccess service.

Starting today the company will start changing how it markets the service.

Why? Well yesterday Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo announced that Verizon Wireless has agreed to halt the deceptive marketing of its internet usage plans and reimburse \$1 million to customers for wrongful account termination nationwide.

The settlement follows a nine-month investigation into the marketing of NationalAccess and BroadbandAccess plans for wireless access to the internet for

What is at risk

The Mexican list of U.S. goods includes pork legs, apples, grapes, cheese and steel. Canada’s proposed tariffs cover whiskey, orange juice and other food products, in addition to steel and aluminum in various forms. Canada is the largest supplier of steel and aluminum products to the United States.

Canada’s agriculture-related imports of U.S. goods mostly comprise consumer-oriented products, such as prepared foods and fresh fruits and vegetables. Mexico’s top two grabs by dollar value are corn and soybeans, followed by pork and pork products at $1.5 billion. (https://tmsnrt.rs/2LaRWbL)

Mexico’s measures appeared to include only a portion of U.S. pork and product imports, but traders did not like the news. July lean hogs on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange plunged 3 percent on Thursday, its largest single-day percentage drop in two months.

Luckily for U.S. corn and soybean producers, their products were not in Mexico’s crosshairs on Thursday, but that does not mean they are safe.

In terms of Canada’s list, exports of U.S. fruit and vegetable juices to its northern neighbor totaled $412 million in 2017, with orange juice products accounting for a little less than half.

Even more at stake?

With the amount of corn and soybeans it purchases, Mexico has more potential to directly influence U.S. grain and oilseed markets than does Canada. Mexico’s threat to U.S. pork also directly impacts grains because they are used in livestock feed.

The way the ongoing trade dispute with China unfolded should be a lesson. China’s list of U.S. goods to tax did not include soybeans when threats initially started flying between the two countries earlier this year. But when Washington raised the stakes so did Beijing, throwing soybeans into the mix, which are worth at least $12 billion a year to the United States.

If Mexico wants to inflict pain on U.S. agriculture, corn would be its trump card, followed by soybeans. The United States shipped 14.7 million tonnes of the yellow grain to its largest buyer in 2017, worth $2.65 billion, and that made up 28 percent of total U.S. corn shipments.

Mexico is the top customer of U.S. pork and pork products, accounting for one

"We have some really heavy hitters with this," Berman said, referencing special guest Paul Chodas, manager of JPL's Near-Earth Object Program Office. "I'm really proud of this one. This is going to be a show where you get it from the horse's mouth."

Asteroid 2004 BL86: How to see it

At its peak brightness, the asteroid 2004 BL86 is expected to reach magnitude +9, which is a little dimmer than the planet Neptune and much brighter than the dwarf planet Pluto. This means that the asteroid will not be visible to the naked eye, but is definitely within reach to observers with binoculars or a small 3- or 4-inch telescope who know when and where to look, according to skywatching alert from Sky & Telescope Magazine.

"I think it's exciting just to look in the right direction, to stare up above where Jupiter is and say 'wow,'" Berman said.

Observers in the Americas, Europe, and Africa will have the best seats during the asteroid's peak brightness, which will occur tonight from 8 p.m. EST until about 1 a.m. EST on Tuesday (0100 to 0600 GMT). The moon will be shining through the night, but it will be in the western sky, so its moonlight should not pose too much of an interference. [Asteroid Quiz: The Space Rock Challenge]

Asteroid BL86 will be brightest when it flies by the Beehive Cluster seen in this star map. The line through the image shows the path of the giant space rock.

The asteroid will be zooming along at roughly 2.5 degrees (five times the size of the moon) per hour. Weather permitting, you should be able to see it inching its way across the sky, especially if there's a nearby star to serve as a reference point.

"Realistically speaking it's only a third of a mile, and the moon by comparison, is 2,160 miles wide," Berman told Space.com "So you figure this is one 6,000th the diameter of the moon. Plus it's three times further away. So if you put those together it'll appear 18,000 times smaller than the moon. So that means it's a dot through any telescope."

Meet Cricket. A four year old Britt beauty, who was recently surrendered by owners who were in their 70’s and felt she was “too much” for them. Sadly, they were an experienced Brittany home, too.

Cricket is thriving in her foster home on a horse farm—where she can run at top speed, swim in a pool and their ponds and chase birds. Please note: Cricket has a strong prey drive and kills geese and chickens.

Cricket would do great with another dog to play with, and/or an active lifestyle. If you can provide the stimulation she is one great girl. Fully vetted and spayed. Application and adoption fee. For more information contact: Laurie email: ncls@twc.com

I bought this brand on the recommendation of my eye doctor who told me I needed a preservative-free drop and thus needed to use the single use vials. To me, this product does not moisturize nearly as well as Thera Tears. What I do prefer over the Thera Tears packaging is that this vial has just the right amount of drops for a single use and can also be recapped for use a very short time later. I have chronic dry eyes due to Hashimoto's Thyroiditis and need some type eye moisturizer on a daily basis, often multiple times a day, so this fits easily in my purse and, as I said previously, can be recapped.

This was provided by my doctor after LASIK surgery. I bought this same drop because I wanted to use a drop that was safe for my eye. After 2 weeks I bought the Refresh Optive with preservatives and this one without preservatives is WAY better. The bottled version has a larger, harder to control drop that hits my eye then immediately rolls down my face. The small vial gives just the right amount and stays in place. It also doesn't gum up my eyelashes like the one with preservatives. Although they are single use vials I can get about 8 drops from each one so I just keep in a clean, safe place and use until empty.

I like that these drops are preservative-free. Most eye drops burn my eyes, but these truly are for sensitive eyes. They are also economical because you can put the twist-off top back on and use more than once. I can use one container three different times, morning, afternoon, and right before bed. I definitely recommend these for dry eyes. The only drawback is they don't keep my eyes hydrated as long as I would like.

To open, twist and pull tab to remove. Instill 1 or 2 drops in the affected eye(s) as needed and discard container. If used for post-operative (e.g. LASIK) dryness and discomfort, follow your eye doctor's instructions.Other Information:

Announcements are made in the shelter about the services available from these new case managers. Some of the homeless who spend their days around the shelter avail themselves of these services. For several months the city funds this case management program, but it fails to see any progress made on the streets - the drunks and mentally ill people are still wandering around the city. Complaints from citizens continue. City officials call on the shelter to ask what is going on with the program. The case managers show their records to the city officials, proving that they are doing the job assigned them. Everyone is perplexed. Money is being spent, the case managers are doing as instructed, but the problem remains. What is wrong with this picture?

Here is the deal - homeless people can be divided into two types - shelter homeless, and street homeless. The homeless who spend their days around shelters do so for several reasons, safety and comfort usually. Those homeless who do not make use of shelters have their own reasons, a lack of trust is usually at the top of that list. Also, the addicts and mentally ill who wander the streets usually lack the skills necessary for living in a shelter. Because the shelter homeless spend their days in and around shelters, they are not usually noticed by the general public. Those homeless who wander city streets have no other choice.

The problem of the above scenario is that the case managers are sitting behind desks. They are shuffling paper work instead of getting out and scouting the streets for homeless people who could benefit from their help. To reduce the number of homeless people living on the streets, it is imperative that case managers, and others who work with the homeless, do outreach work. They should not be sitting behind desks and waiting for the homeless to approach them. Often these shelter case managers will claim that they don't have time to do outreach too. And this may be true as resources are often limited. It is easy for a case manager to occupy him/her self with helping 100 shelter homeless people file for food stamps instead of helping 2 street homeless find permanent housing. When setting priorities it is important to establish quality over site and not just assume that the case managers should fend for themselves. In the homelessness industry, communication is still the biggest problem, a lack of proper over site is a close second.

It is also important to recognize that not every outreach effort is really benefiting the homeless. Many outreach efforts only work to get the homeless into shelters. This may temporarily clear the streets of

Seeing clearly adds safety, but so does Smith's Carbonic lens material -- the most impact resistant lens material money can buy. Smith treats them with an anti-scratch coating to keep them as new as possible, as long as possible. They're light, they exceed ANSI Z80.3 specifications, and they protect your eyes from 100% of the UVA, UVB, and UVC rays out there.

The Grilamid TR90 frame provides you with maximum comfort, maximum flexibility, maximum toughness, and maximum resistance to sweat and sunscreen. And the hydrophilic Megol nose and temple pads keep them locked in place on your face. They won't slip. They won't slide. They won't fall off.

The Smith Parallel offers a close fit to your face and offers what's considered as medium coverage. It's available in Black w/polar grey and Brown w/polar brown. With either color option, you'll get two extra sets of lenses. The Ignitor lenses are great for overcast days as they increase definition and depth perception in low light. The Clear lenses are the best for very low light conditions. Switching between lenses is a total breeze and can be done in a matter of moments without tools.

POLARCHROMIC COPPER provides increased color definition and medium contrast while reducing reflected glare from water, sand, or pavement. An exceptional general purpose Polarchromic lens that is comfortable and soothing to wear all day.

These shades easily trump the Rudy Projects I've been using for quite a few years. The optics are extremely clear and clean. They're lightweight and fit my smaller face nicely. Having additional lenses is a definite bonus. I was considering the Oakley Half Jacket at the time of purchase, but I feel the Smith's provide a much greater bang for the buck. Believe someone else has stated this before, but the greatest measure of cycling shades is when you truly forget you're even wearing them. These definitely fall into that category. I've found myself (out of habit) attempting to push them back up my nose, but they have yet to move a millimeter.

Brevard County Men Arrested In Volusia County Underage Sex Sting Operation

VOLUSIA COUNTY, Florida - Two Brevard County men were among the suspects arrested in an underage sex sting operation conducted in Volusia County.

"For five days, online predators looking for sex with teenage girls and boys in Volusia County all came to the same sudden realization: They were chatting with undercover law enforcement officers, not children," the Volusia County Sheriff's Office stated in a release.

By Saturday’s end of “Operation Indecent Proposal,” a joint effort between the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office and several other local, state and federal agencies, fourteen men were arrested after allegedly traveling here to meet their victims.

"This is what's out there lurking on the Internet," said Sheriff Mike Chitwood, who was present at the decoy house for part of the operation. "This is what you're dealing with: Scumbag Central. I know when I left there, I felt like I needed to take a shower."

Ryan Joseph Rahme

The two Brevard County men arrested were 36-year-old Ryan Joseph Rahme of Palm Bay and 21-year-old Kyle J. Galloway of Mims. Both men remain in custody in the Volusia County Jail. Rahme is held under a no bond status and Galloway is under a $65,000 bond.

Kyle J. Galloway

Among the arrests were:

Victor Williams, 40 (DOB 8/16/1976), of Palm Coast, a social services contractor who has worked with children in the past. Sheriff’s detectives are working to develop a comprehensive list of Williams’ past clients and contacts with children, and will conduct interviews with them as the investigation continues. Anyone with information that might be relevant to this investigation is asked to contact the VCSO Child Exploitation Unit at 386-323-3574.

Christopher Chierchio, 36 (DOB 6/28/1980), of Preble, N.Y., a registered sex offender who absconded from New York in 2015.

William Parshall, 58 (DOB 1/28/1959), of Jacksonville, a retired U.S. Navy civilian logistics employee who said he’s had multiple contacts with juvenile females while chatting online daily for approximately three years.

His muted "calm down" celebration says everything about his state of mind at 28. Watching Cristiano at the Bernabeu is to watch a man in control of himself. A mature leader and goalscorer.

The papers can talk all they want. He´s not leaving even if Jose is. His career at Real is slowly etching itself into the club´s illustrious Hall Of Fame. Winning the big one would certainly escalate him to Di Stefano, Puskas and Zidane sainthood.
2-0 Benzema must have been morale-crushing for the Turks. The cross was too high for Ronnie, but spare man Karim rustled it home at the far stick.

And any lingering hopes the tie could be salvaged back in Istanbul were extinguished by the third from sub Higuain from another routinely accurate free-kick by Xabi Alonso.

And Essien may no longer be world-class since his layoff woes but venturing forward, reading the game and always looking for the probing pass still marks him out. He was Chelsea´s lynchpin in the Mourinho years and he´s still a top player.

Galatasaray can point to a terrible refereeing blunder which if the man in the middle had called it right, may have wrought them a priceless away goal.

Instead, Yilmaz ended in the book for diving when actually he´d been stamped on in the penalty area by Ramos. Harsh treatment indeed but few would argue with the result as Galatasaray lacked Madrid's mobility.

I was so moved by the professionalism and intensity of Madrid's play and Galatasaray's persistent attempt at shape despite adversity that the Champions League without English clubs now is a better competition for it.
Despite running away with the Premier League, Manchester United are at best the ninth team in Europe and in my opinion, Galatasaray would have had enough to beat them here.

We have a Little Englander view of Hispanics as prima donnas and cheats, but that's to ignore their inherent characteristics of togetherness, toughness, belligerence and style.

Drive down the road from the airport to the Bernabeu and know Real Madrid is a consequence of a city which is just as professional.

Cor Cymraeg Rehoboth, the performance choir affiliated with Delta's Welsh church, begins its concert tour of Wales on Monday. From July 1 through 9, the 35-voice choir will sing in concerts with Welsh choirs and participate in competitions.

"Although we represent the Delta community and its heritage of the area's early Welsh settlers, we shall also be presenting a musical repertoire of American selections which exemplify our nation," Glenn Grove, choir president, said in a press release.

Cor Rehoboth performs in joint concerts with Cor Bro Ogwr of Brigend, Wales on July 3 at Tabernacle Chapel in Cardiff; with Cor Cantorion Creigiau of Rhwbina on July 4 in a Cardiff suburb; and with Cor Bro Aled Male Voice Choir on July 7 at Trinity Church, Llandudno.

By invitation, the choir also will compete in mixed choir competitions at the Cardigan Festival on July 6. Members will take part in the 20-voices hymn singing contest, and they will also participate in the 30-voices-plus contest of two contrasting pieces of music. In that, they will sing the modern "Passsage" based on a Walt Whitman work and the spiritual "Walk on Children."

Cor Rehoboth was formed in 1984 as a link to the historic Rehoboth church, and, on an initial concert tour of Wales in 1992, it won a prize at the National Eisteddfod, Wales' renowned singing competition.

Cor Bro Ogwr performed jointly with the Delta choristers in a performance in Lancaster and at Delta's annual spring Gymanfa Ganu in May 2013. As in Lancaster, the July 3 concert will feature the two choirs singing excerpts from Joseph Parry's oratorio "Emmanuel," as well as traditional Welsh and American songs.

The 35 members of Cor Rehoboth traveling abroad next week come from Delaware, Maryland and the District of Columbia, as well as other areas of Pennsylvania and the Delta, Pa., region.

In the past, the choir has performed in venues in England, France, Nova Scotia and locales throughout the American East Coast. The choir was featured in the 2010 summer Smithsonian Folk Life Festival, as well as the Maryland Folklife festival this month. Cor Rehoboth was also featured at the movie-star wedding of Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas.

Through some horse trading and such, I took possession of a brand new Ruger 22/45 on Thursday. After much discussion, Jennifer and I decided that we wanted the model that has the threaded barrel. If silencers ever actually go non-NFA, we’ll probably get a few of them. Until then, I don’t see paying the $200.00 racket and putting my name on the list of ‘those people’. Incidentally, did you realize that the threads for these .22-caliber silencers are the same as the threads on an AR-15 compensator? So, if you have a .223 silencer, it stands to reason that it will screw right onto the Ruger pistol. Not only that, but an M16 birdcage will fit on the 22/45 barrel as though it was intended to be there.

So anyway, this contraption was one of the many items of interest that we took with us when we visited Phlegmmy and LawDog this weekend, although they seemed to be more excited about the avocados. LawDog took this pistol in his paw and scratched his head, with a puzzled look on his face.

“Hmm,” he shrugged, “Fair enough. It does look kind of cool – like a Buck Rogers gun.”

Somehow, we’d made it across state lines with no more range toys than a couple of .22s. Even so, we managed to get out to the range with LawDog and throw copeous amounts of tiny lead projectiles downrange. Our S&W 617 performed predictably and boringly well. Phlegmmy’s lever action was dead accurate and ran all varieties of .22, although it was a little picky on the lever stroke with certain cartridges. The little Ruger exceeded every one of my expectations. We probably put more lead through it than the other guns combined, by a factor of two. In total, we went through about 600-700 hollow points, about 150-Colibris, and probably fifty each of CCI’s CB Shorts and .22 Quiets. The 22/45 didn’t so much as hiccup on anything. Of course, the lower powered ammunition would not work the action, but we’re not counting that as a flaw of the gun.

It seems to be dead-nuts accurate and it simply begs to be shot and shot and shot. Once we got back to the fort,

J P de V van Niekerk

Managing Editor

I signed my father out of hospital and took him back to his retirement home, as was his wish. Following a near-death event from which had recovered he was fine and cheerful but apologetic about causing trouble and was awaiting a battery of tests. He died the next morning at his home and in my presence at the age of 93 years. He was not in a strange bed and surroundings, had not had invasive tests and was possibly spared the indignity of death with tubes, catheters and other end-of-life interventions. Family who recently faced a similar situation with their mother, who had had a good innings but was declining in hospital, felt burdened about their potential decisions. My suggestion to them was that acceptance rather than a decision was called for. In the USA a large slice of the health care budget is spent in frenetic and futile end-of-life medical activities, and in South Africa we are often guilty of the same.

Doctors often feel pressurised to do something for every patient. Apart from satisfying our own needs this compulsion is also fuelled by our patients, whose expectations are disappointed if they feel that nothing or too little is being done for them. Medical practice is strewn with examples of procedures that have been abandoned when shown to be ineffective or harmful. Today too doctors and the public can often do much better by following the evidence rather than relying on myth and belief. Here are some examples.

As a child I suffered regular doses of castor oil and phenolphthalein (at least the latter was disguised with chocolate flavour) because of the belief at the time that a periodic bowel clear-out was healthy. For the same reason periodic enemas had been in vogue (and are still offered in 'health' spas1). Fortunately we now appreciate that these practices are harmful and that the bowel with its various active cells and chemicals and its mucus-lined walls is an exquisite processor of food and rarely needs help other than a prudent diet. Besides, one of life's less expressed and appreciated pleasures is to unburden oneself naturally!

Paediatric cough and cold medications are prescribed and obtained over the counter for the slightest cough or sniffle. Such preparations may contain various combinations of antihistamines, decongestants, antitussives and expectorants. A recent paper in the New England

To Fix Health Care System, Put Consumers in Charge

Democrats were riding high in the polls in 2006 and 2008, and one of their big issues was health care. Then, after passing the president’s health care law, the politics shifted, and the issue helped sweep the GOP to victory in the 2010 midterm elections. A few months later, Republicans had a 14-point advantage in terms of voter trust on the health care issue.

Then, Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan introduced his health care plan, and the lead disappeared. Neither party has an advantage on the issue now.

President Obama’s plan is unpopular, and most want to see it repealed. Ryan’s plan is unpopular, and few want to see it enacted. Both plans are unpopular because neither one puts consumers in charge of their own health care decisions. More than anything else, that lack of consumer control is the root cause of the health care problems facing our nation today.

Americans now pay a smaller share of their disposable income on out-of-pocket medical care than they did in 1960. Nearly nine out of every 10 dollars spent on medical care coverage is paid by either an insurance company or the government. Since someone else is paying the bills, someone else ends up making the big decisions about things that affect every individual’s health care.

That is precisely what most Americans want to change. No one wants their health care choices being made by government officials, insurance companies or their employer. People want to make those important decisions themselves.

Putting consumers in charge would require pretty radical change, but it’s the type of change voters could support. For example, consider a fairly typical situation where a company provides health insurance coverage for its workers. Rather than letting the company choose the plan, 82 percent believe that each worker should be allowed to use that money to pick his or her own insurance plan. If that plan ends up costing less than the official company plan, most believe the worker should be allowed to keep the change.

But giving consumers control of the money doesn’t mean much unless they have a variety of competing insurance plans to consider. Three out of four voters think it’s time to end the antitrust exemption granted to health insurance companies. Why? By a three-to-one margin, voters believe that increased competition among insurance companies would do more to reduce costs than increased government regulation.

Voters also want to reign in the government bureaucrats. Rather than letting the government define a

Most Improved: Bam Adebayo

What a season for Bam Adebayo. The third-year center developed from his reserve role behind Hassan Whiteside into one of the league’s premier big-men. Adebayo’s 5.1 assists per game ranks firmly in second among all centers, only trailing the Nuggets’ crafty Nikola Jokic. Bam’s larger role caused his point-per-game average to nearly double along with a rebounds-per-game increase of 3.2. With a combination of elite court-vision and playmaking ability for his size, along with the defensive skill that held league MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo to just thirteen points, Adebayo’s ceiling is sky-high.

Best Rookie: Kendrick Nunn

After going undrafted in 2018 and being waived by the Golden State’s G-League affiliate in 2019, Miami took a chance on 24-year-old Chicago native Kendrick Nunn. Nunn opened the eyes of many in the Heat’s final preseason game where he recorded a whopping forty points against the Rockets’ star-studded backcourt. Nunn carried his hot streak into the regular season, breaking the NBA record for the most points scored by a undrafted player in their first 5 career games. Nunn’s 112 points through his first five games were also the most by any rookie since Kevin Durant’s 2007 rookie season. Nunn finished the year with three of the four Rookie-of-the-Month awards handed out by the NBA along with an exceptional 15.6 points-per-game. If you asked me if I had any doubt that this kid has a bright future ahead of him, I’d tell you that I have “Nunn”.

Biggest Surprise: Duncan Robinson

Duncan Robinson for three! No one could have predicted that the undrafted Michigan product would go on to break the Heat’s team record for 3-pointers made in a season this year, connecting on 243 attempts in just 65 games. Robinson played a huge role in Miami’s magical season, tying the Heat record by making ten three-pointers in one game along with a streak of 50 consecutive games with a made three pointer. His lethal shooting ability has been a driving force in guiding Miami to the league’s highest three-point field goal percentage at 38.3

Public intellectual Cornel West is once again criticizing President Barack Obama, according to the excerpt from his new book published by Salon today.

West claims that Obama co-opted “the grand Black prophetic tradition,” and in doing so “made it more difficult for Black courageous and radical voices to bring critique to bear on the U.S. empire.”

Obama is the embodiment of a shift in “Black leadership from the voices of social movements to those of elected officials in the mainstream political system.”

“This shift produces voices that are rarely if ever critical of this system,” he writes. “This shift is part of a larger structural transformation in the history of mid-twentieth-century capitalism in which neoliberal elites marginalize social movements and prophetic voices in the name of consolidating a rising oligarchy at the top, leaving a devastated working class in the middle, and desperate poor people whose labor is no longer necessary for the system at the bottom.”

West also blames the president for helping to silence the “prophetic voices” that would otherwise be able to lead the country out of its current predicament.

“The central role of mass media, especially a corporate media beholden to the U.S. neoliberal regime, is to keep public discourse narrow and deodorized,” West writes. “By ‘narrow,’ I mean confining the conversation to conservative Republican and neoliberal Democrats who shut out prophetic voices or radical visions. This fundamental power to define the political terrain and categories attempts to render prophetic voices invisible.”

Because of this, “the state of Black America in the age of Obama has been one of desperation, confusion, and capitulation. The desperation is rooted in the escalating suffering on every front. The confusion arises from a conflation of symbol and substance. The capitulation rests on an obsessive need to protect the first Black president against all forms of criticism.”

“The Obama presidency,” he continues, “has been primarily a Wall Street presidency, drone presidency, mass surveillance presidency unwilling to concretely target the new Jim Crow, massive unemployment, and other forms of poor and Black social misery. His major effort to focus on poor Black men was charity and philanthropy — not justice or public policy.”

2. Because allergies to tree nuts are so common among children, keep your child at least 5 miles away from the following things at all times: Tree nuts, nuts, trees, trees which have been near nuts, nuts which have been near trees, squirrels carrying nuts, squirrels in trees, squirrels in trees, carrying nuts, squirrels which are neither in a tree, nor carrying nuts, people who have touched trees, people who have eaten nuts, people who have eaten trees, and anything which rhymes with tree or nut.

3. To prevent your child from being infected by germs, we suggest encasing him/her in a cube of protective, gelatinous goo.

4. ‘Regular’ toys such as dolls and action figures are gateway toys to matches and scissors so playtime is out of the question.

5. School is dangerous, so homeschool your child. That way, they will be too socially awkward to ever talk to strangers.

6. If you for some reason ignore that last advice and send your child to school, you’ll need to worry about bullying. To keep your child safe from bullies, train him/her to be the bully, that way no one will mess with them. To train them, we suggest a ‘training montage’ set to Survivor’s Eye of the Tiger.

7. As you know, any injury to your child whatsoever (even a stubbed toe) is a complete disaster. If your child appears even slightly injured, the application of bandages is in order. Don’t use store bought band-aids as those are crawling with diseases. Instead, wrap your child head to toe in home-made bandages which if you are a good parent you will already have lots of.

8. If your child coughs, sneezes, blows his/her nose or just feels under the weather, no school for the rest of the year. Maybe try again next year, but that can be risky.

9. Tetanus is always something to be concerned about. To avoid your child stepping on rusty nails, construct a pair of ‘Safety Shoes’ out of sponges for the child to wear at all times.

11. Store bought sunglasses won’t protect your child from the harsh sunlight. We recommend a strip of duct tape around the eyes, or staying inside the house. However if your lights are turned on, the strip of

O'Rourke chided Cruz for supporting legislation that would have allocated billions of dollars to build a wall along the U.S. -Mexico border, and called for an earned path to citizenship.

As I've said before, I'm still skeptical about the idea of a Democrat winning statewide in Texas even in a year such as this when anti-Republican animus appears to be motivating Democrats to vote in numbers not typically seen in midterm elections. Cruz wants to add more officers and metal detectors in schools. Cruz said "absolutely", but didn't elaborate while calling the allegations serious.

Cruz offered no compromise on hardline immigration measures or gun control, months after a mass shooting at a high school near Houston. We couldn't find a local Cruz-sponsored event (but please let us know if you're aware of one).

Political analyst Charlie Cook, described as one of the "best in the business" by both Republicans and Democrats, today changed his race rating for the Texas Senate race to toss-up from "lean Republican".

The spat Cruz had with Trump in the 2016 primary, and the way Cruz capitulated nearly immediately after, was not just a matter of whether Cruz had the principles to stand up for himself or his family.

Cruz and O'Rourke are facing each other in a surprisingly competitive US Senate race in Texas, a Republican stronghold. Ted Cruz by two points.

U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) and U.S. Rep. Robert Francis "Beto" O'Rourke (D-TX) are pictured in this combination photo in Houston, Texas, U.S., September 20, 2018 and in McAllen, Texas, U.S., August 18, 2018 respectively.

If you were to believe the press reports over the past 24 hours Arsenal are ready to bid for Edinson Cavani (again) and Karim Benzema has/is flying in for a medical with the club.

That’s a whole lot of striker for one club, not to mention a bucketload of cash in transfer fees and wages, so what’s going on?

Well, it’s August, that’s what.

The Cavani reports seem to stem from Spain, an unlikely point of origin for a player who is currently in France but being linked with England, while the Benzema reports seem to come from Twitter – a hotbed of nonsense at the best of times (although a goldmine for information if you have your bullsh*t filter tuned correctly).

This isn’t the first time that Arsenal have been linked with Cavani, in fact, just last summer he was a name repeatedly linked to the club by people who had no clue the Gunners were actually going after Alexis Sanchez.

There is about as much to the Cavani story as there is to the reports of the Benzema medical which, if silly season holds true to form, will see him have at least three medicals before never signing for the club. Perhaps he’s waiting for Arsenal to finish up with Yann M’Vila before he gets on the treadmill.

Karim Benzema has been linked with Arsenal all summer (Picture: Getty Images)

Arsenal may buy a new striker, but they may not, it’s impossible to tell. What we do know is that Arsene Wenger has already said: ‘We are open-minded but we are not desperate. Today we didn’t have (Danny) Welbeck or (Alexis) Sanchez, who are big players.

‘(Jack) Wilshere didn’t play as well, so we will have a good squad when everyone is back. We are open-minded but many clubs are on the market with big, big money.

‘At the moment our squad is well-balanced quality-wise and numbers-wise.

‘When you win the FA Cup final scoring four goals and score six today, it shows scoring goals is not our problem.’

Then again, something else we know for sure at this time of the year, just like you can’t trust the reports in the media, you can’t really

A book grouping together the contributions by speakers at the Amman conference in 2011 has recently been published (April 2014). It can be downloaded here.

From 15th to 17th March 2014 a conference on mobility and freedom of movement entitled "Advocating for mobility : right on track" was held in Amman, Jordan and grouped together a wide range of activists and cultural operators working in the Arab region.

A petition was launched that has to date received the signatures of over 300 organisations and individuals from some 70 countries worldwide in support of artistic and cultural mobility in the Arab world.

The final aim of the project is to encouragethe diffusion of reliable resource information, to structureartistic and cultural projects around key partners and to buildlong-term multilateral relations.

Results

The partners have obtained the following results since 2010 (Istikshaf phase I from 2010 to 2011, Istikshaf phase II from 2012 to 2014).

Influencing policies

The policy agenda was developed to be the first of its kind in the region and was officially launched in Beirut (November 2012), in Doha (May 2013), and in Amman (May 2013). Visits to Palestine, Lebanon, Egypt, Morocco, Algeria and Sudan were made to promote the agenda and invite additional key signatories. So far, more than 368 organizations and individuals from 52 countries signed the agenda including regional performing arts networks, NGOs, municipalities, and governmental organizations.

The outreach campaign pilot project in Amman continues with the “Jeera” project gaining momentum and the collaboration with Amman municipality strengthened. The Safar mobility fund in Palestine has grown in numbers to reach 3000 members on the facebook page, organizing travels twice a month with 150 participants in each trip, and expanding collaborations and the concept of mobility to different people and organizations.

Several new mobility initiatives (local, regional, and international) have been initiated and synergies are being developed such as connecting with initiatives in the Balkan area; the Asia-Europe Foundation; the We are More Campaign in Europe, and the Anna Lindh Foundation Dawrak initiative. Through the outreach program Istikshaf connected with various advocacy campaigns connected to mobility such as Bikarama and Right to Enter in Palestine and the Tamasi policy advocacy campaign in support of the performing arts in the MENA region.

Some individuals may be more sensitive to the effects of smoke from forest fires, such as those with heart or lung conditions.

These individuals should watch for any change in symptoms that may be due to smoke exposure.

If any symptoms are noted, affected individuals should take steps to reduce their exposure to smoke and if necessary see their physician or local walk-in clinic.

People with severe symptoms should present themselves to the nearest Emergency Department.

Dr. Sue Pollock, Medical Health Officer with Interior Health provided tips and information on the smoke advisory which you can listen to below.

According to IHA, here are some actions you can take to reduce the health effects of smoke in the air:

People with heart or lung conditions may be more sensitive to the effects of smoke and should watch for any change in symptoms that may be due to smoke exposure. If any symptoms are noted, affected individuals should take steps to reduce their exposure to smoke and if necessary see their physician. People with symptoms should go to their health care provider, walk in clinic or emergency department depending on severity of symptoms.

Use common sense regarding outdoor physical activity – if your breathing becomes difficult or uncomfortable, stop or reduce the activity.

Stay cool and drink plenty of fluids.

Smoke levels may be lower indoors, however levels of smoke particles will still be increased. If you stay indoors, be aware of your symptoms.

Consider visiting a location like a shopping mall with cooler filtered air. Keep in mind that staying indoors may help you stay cool and provide some relief from the smoke. However, many air conditioning systems do not filter the air or improve indoor air quality.

Reduce indoor pollution sources such as smoking or burning other materials.

You may be able to reduce your exposure to smoke by moving to cleaner air. Conditions can vary dramatically by area and elevation.

Residents with asthma or other chronic illness should activate their asthma or personal care plan.

Pay attention to local air quality reports, air quality may be poor even though smoke may not be visible.

Commercially available HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filters can further reduce poor indoor air quality near the device.

Maintaining good overall health is a good way to prevent health effects resulting from short-term exposure to air pollution.

The win puts Midland in good position to win the SVL title at 15-3, and the Chemics are 26-5 overall. They finish league play on Thursday with a doubleheader at Davison.

Saginaw Heritage and Mount Pleasant split a doubleheader on Monday, putting the Chemics a half game ahead of the Oilers (14-3 SVL) in first place. Mount Pleasant will host Flint Powers in a doubleheader on Thursday and will complete a suspended game next week with Dow in which the Chargers are ahead 6-1.

Dow fell to 9-11 in the league and 17-15-1 for the season.

While not satisfied with the outcome, Dow coach Rich Juday saw some good signs from his Chargers.

"We played good baseball," he said. "A couple of things we did in game two defensively allowed them to score some runs; otherwise, maybe we win that game. Our guys learn in every single game. ... I told the guys, 'Hey, you lose 10-0 in game one and come back and end up losing 3-1 and being in a battle, (so that shows improvement).

"We have to continue to improve. It's a process to get this program back where we want it to be. And we're getting there. I'm very impressed with the way this team has responded to our coaching," Juday added.

In game one, Patty and Dow starting pitcher Connor Moe kept both teams off the board until the bottom of the third, when Midland struck for two runs with two outs.

Patty singled to center and scored on a double to right by Martin Money that the rightfielder appeared to lose sight of in the sun. Greg Landis followed with a solid double to right-center to make it 2-0.

The Chemics then blew the game open with seven runs in the fourth. Brendan Doyle doubled home Willis and scored on Zack Servinski's single. Lane Peters replaced Moe and walked two batters to load the bases with two outs. Greg Landis singled home two runs, and his younger brother, Jeff Landis, followed with a 365-foot three-run homer to right to make it 9-0.

Jeff Landis, a sophomore, leads the Chemics with four home runs this season."He's a big, strong kid, and maybe the best news for him is

Law could help curb unwanted pregnancies in Chattanooga

Law could help curb unwanted pregnancies in Chattanooga

New federal laws requiring birth control in health insurance plans has at least one doctor excited about curbing an already decreasing trend of unwanted pregnancies around Chattanooga.

"It's absolutely an excellent policy," said Dr. Susanna Carter, a physician at University Health Obstetrics and Gynecology in Chattanooga. "As a female patient advocate and caregiver, I'm very pleased with it."

The stipulation is included within a wide new swath of coverage for women's preventive care. President Barack Obama announced earlier this month that health insurance plans must cover federally approved birth control without copays and other fees. Some sterilization procedures also must be covered.

The requirements, partly delineated by the Food and Drug Administration, take effect on New Year's Day in 2013.

According to news reports, the Obama administration followed the recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences. The academy said nearly half of all pregnancies in America were unintended, and about 40 percent of those ended in abortions.

It's unclear how the new requirements will affect teenagers across the nation. In some states, parents must be notified if girls below 18 visit a doctor for birth control. Tennessee and Georgia allow minors to obtain birth control without parental permission.

Carter, the local physician, outlined her philosophy: She prescribes birth control without hesitation if the teen is healthy and wants it, even if a parent isn't present.

"I don't know if that's ever happened -- usually the mother is with her," she said. "There still needs to be more done to reach out to teenagers, but that opens a political can of worms in the South."

On its own, Hamilton County has seen a steep drop in teen birth rates, particularly among black girls in their middle teenage years. Pregnancy rates have fallen by nearly half since 2008, state records show.

Among all girls ages 15 to 19, Tennessee's birth rate has fallen by a quarter since 1991 and Georgia's has dropped 32 percent, newspaper archives show.

Still, the South lags behind the nation. Tennessee and Georgia ranked among the 15 highest teen birthrates in America in 2008, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Conceding to social conservatives, the new provision includes an exception for religious institutions to choose against offering birth control coverage.


Growing Cacti In Zone 9 – Best Cacti For Zone 9 Gardens

Most cacti are thought of as desert dwellers that thrive in baking hot sun and punishing, nutrient poor soils. While much of this is true, many cacti can thrive where brief freezes occur and some even in areas with snow. Cacti for zone 9 will find average low temperatures in Fahrenheit of 20 to 30 or -7 to -1 Celsius. There are many specimens of zone 9 cacti available for such extremes. Some of the more hardy groups are Echinocereus, Mammilaria and Opuntia, but there are many more subspecies in semi-hardy families which are useful to zone 9 gardeners.

Zone 9 Cactus Info

Cactus and other succulents are easy to maintain and have few special care requirements once established. They perform beautifully either in the ground in warmer climates, in containers outdoors in summer or indoors year round.

Using cactus for zone 9 can provides a desert themed landscape with drought tolerance and often brightly colored flowers and fruits. Most specimens suited for the region are smaller plants but mixed with yuccaor agavefor vertical appeal, they can bring a note of Saharan splendor to your backyard.

Before even selecting plants, the right conditions need to be developed for growing cacti in zone 9. Cacti need freely draining soil and do nicely in gritty mediums. In garden beds, you can add horticultural sand, gravel or other gritty material to enhance drainage. Potted plants prefer a cactus mixture or a 50% mix of sand and potting soil.

Most prefer sun all day long but should be protected from the hottest rays of the day to prevent sunburn. Contrary to popular belief, cacti do need water. Plants with pads will wither and pucker when cacti are drought stressed. Barrel cacti and those with needles fare better due to adaptations in the skin and needles that help conserve moisture and prevent burning. Most cacti for zone 9 should be watered once a week in summer and once or twice per month in winter.

Choosing Zone 9 Cacti

Pretty much any containerized cactus can be grown indoors in zone 9. It’s the varieties for outdoors that need to be vetted. Some of the better cact

I am rooting for cricket now, not any specific team! I just want to watch good cricket, which I am getting in plenty… Oram’s spell against WI was superlative, Lara’s knock against Australia showed why he is the best, Sarwan’s throw to run out Ponting, Lara’s right hand pick up and throw to run out Fleming, McCullum’s catch, Malinga’s 4 wickets in 4 balls, Vaas bowling AB de Villiers with arguably the best ball of the tournament!

Now that I have made my point on being unbiased, will someone go and please defeat Australia! They are ruining the WC ala Federer… We need a GuillermoCanas.

There is no doubt that the book Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami is written brilliantly. The book has an amazing grip on the reader, but I am not sure whether I loved the book or not. The book is surreal, when I was reading the book I was so engrossed in it that I did not mind the magical things happening – cats talking, fish falling from sky, souls leaving the body & coming back – I even felt unreal after keeping down the book.

The book is about two people – Kafka Tamura & Satoru Nakata. Their stories run parallel to each other, initially both stories are independent but finally they intertwine. Both of them have left the comforts of their home. Kafka runs away from home on his 15th birthday to escape his father’s curse, and Nakata – nearer to end of his life rather then the beginning & has the ability to talk to cats – has a strange calling, he moves from one place to another only knowing what to do when he reaches the next place.

The book plays more on the subconscious then the conscious. There are many questions left unanswered in the book, it is a book that is difficult to understand and the more you try to understand it the more questions crop up. As per Murakami the secret to understanding the novel lies in reading it multiple times. Throughout the book there are multiple references to various literary works, and musical compositions. If I were to put my finger on the theme of this book, I would fail abysmally. There is suspense, there is magic, there is fantasy, there is violence, even humour finds place, and there are constant sexual fantasies.


The second item in the hashtag game to master is finding your goldilocks number (not too many, not too few) to be effective. Each social post should have one message and by tagging many ancillary keywords you dilute your message (and make it harder to read).

When you go to write your next social post, ask yourself, “What’s my main message?” Select one or two hashtags that reinforce your message, not detract from it.

2. Know best times for engagement

While each business will have different times for the best engagement on each social network, you first need to get started with a jumping off point. From Twitter to Google+, each network has a time when activity is high so posting around these times is the best way to reach your audience.

The downside to this strategy is that these times may not be specific to your audience. To know what works best for you, start taking note of when you receive the most engagement and test out posting at different times of day.

3. Know how often to post

Do you ever feel like there is Facebook Page that keeps your news feed full 24/7 (when you really just want to see what your friends are posting)? When a Facebook Page, or any social profile does this, users are more likely to stop following that Page’s updadates — or block them completely from their newsfeed (which counteracts all efforts).

Instead of posting 24/7 with the hopes of grabbing people’s attention, post at optimal times with focused content. If you follow the posting schedule below, you’ll get a good idea of the best time to post (saving you both time and effort). Most social media networks should only be posted to a few times a week, while Twitter can be posted to several times a day.

4. Know how often to share content

When you have content to share, you want to make sure it reaches as many eyes as possible so you can get the most out of the effort you put into the piece. By following a posting (or a promotional) schedule, your business will have successful content that helps you reach your goals.

5. Know how to catch your audiences’ eyes

I’m sure I don’t have to tell you that people no longer want to read long paragraphs — they want to see your message (a la Buzzfeed).

To catch your audiences’ eyes with visual content, use a variety of content

Pay upfront, watch Roth explode later

Do you benefit from having an extra-long time horizon? Then going full throttle in the Roth IRA is apropos, says John O. McManus, founding principal of McManus & Associates in New York City.

“If you can take a long-term view, opt for a Roth IRA and take an aggressive approach with asset allocation and investing,” he says. “Roth IRAs buy you a lot more time to allow the market to recover, absent the mandatory distributions of traditional IRAs. Create a self-directed Roth IRA and pour significant capital in it to build horsepower. Then smartly pursue alternative investments to generate the biggest returns,” he says.

“Private equity and real estate are the 2 best areas where real leverage can be achieved with a Roth IRA. The idea is to pay your taxes up front, then really watch returns from your investments explode.”

To address our clients’ burgeoning international interests, from investments to regular travel, inheritances, and family members overseas, McManus & Associates created an International Practice Group. These professionals are devoted to keeping our clients compliant by meeting proper filing requirements, including those outlined under the Bank Secrecy Act.

The Bank Secrecy Act gave the Department of Treasury the authority to collect information from US persons who have a financial interest in, or signatory authority over, accounts maintained with financial institutions located outside of the US. This provision of the Bank Secrecy Act requires that, if the aggregate maximum value of the foreign financial accounts exceeds $10,000 at any time during the calendar year, you are required to report the accounts annually to the Department of Treasury by electronically filing a Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) 114, Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR).

Currently, for the 2015 tax year, owners of foreign accounts must e-file by June 30th, with no extensions permissible. However, beginning with the 2016 tax year, the FBAR will be due on April 15th, and the taxpayer will be allowed to request an additional six months to file (October 15th deadline).

Scrambling as we approach April 18th? Here are three last-minute tax strategies to harness for proper management of the deadline.

Abstract

Keystroke dynamics biometrics provides a non-intrusive and low cost authentication mechanism for computer users. It further allows for continuous authentication for improved secure access. With the ubiquity of mobile devices and people's increasing dependency on these devices to store sensitive and even critical information, keystroke dynamics has been explored to authenticate mobile device users. Studies have suggested that although keystroke dynamics serves as an effective authentication scheme for mobile devices, it comes short of meeting strong security requirements when used as the sole criterion. In this work we note that the force a user exerts on keys during typing is as idiosyncratic as the timing information. As a result, we extract a user's tapping signature using the motion captures by the accelerometer and gyroscope embedded in a mobile device during typing events to augment the performance of keystroke dynamics biometrics for mobile devices, usually computed using the key timing information. We in particular use gait dynamics image, a highly discriminative representation for motion captured by 3-axis accelerometers and gyroscopes while invariant to sensor rotation, to represent taping signatures due to forces during keying events to achieve invariance to variations in orientation of the mobile device for real-world applications. As the tapping force and time are complementary to each other, this method is expected to provide augmented keystroke dynamics based user authentication for mobile devices.

Uncomfortable Chairs in rows – just no

Arriving late to sessions, leaving early, coming in and out at random… it’s just rude. I was sat next to a woman yesterday who nipped out mid paper to get herself a coffee. Mid paper. FFS

Running over time. Goodness you’d think figuring out time was the most complicated thing in the world. You have x number of minutes, prepare a paper that takes roughly x number of minutes not x plus 10. When the chair tells you you have 2 minutes left, wrap it up. When the chair tells you to stop, stop, don’t ramble on for another 5 minutes. When you are co-presenting you don’t have the time allocated for the paper each – you have to share it. Obviously. I don’t understand why this is sooooooo hard. (Watch me be way over tomorrow now – that would be embarrassing!)

Chairs – it’s ok to tell people to shut up, it really is. You might lose a fan but you’ll gain one in me.

Questions and Comments – they are just that. They are not ‘I will now ramble on about my work which is only vaguely related to yours for a few minutes’. There seem to be some academic traditions across the world where this hijacking of questions is commonplace and expected and maybe I’m just grumpy but it irritates the hell out of me. Ask a question (and no it doesn’t need a 5 minute introduction) or make a short observation or comment.

Discussants. I am yet to be convinced by this format. For it to work the discussant has to be brilliant and quite honestly most of the ones I’ve heard so far fall a long way short of brilliant in that role. Not that I could do a better job, it’s hard BUT it seems to me that a discussant should not speak for longer than each speaker did. It also seems to me that the discussant should briefly offer a comment on each paper but then focus on drawing out themes or questions and opening the discussion up to the audience and panel having set that scene. It also seems clear to me that they should not use the time as discussant to tell people about their own work in any great detail – their work is only relevant in so far as it relates directly to the panel’s papers and comments on them (and presumably to the fact that they are chosen

Bio:

Kayla was born aboard a starship, the daughter of the notorious Gangster Drannis Pek and his wife Isara Welken ( of the wealthy and influential Corellian Welken family). Kayla was raised from ship to ship by her father after the tragic death of her mother when she was young. Eventually Drannis set up his base in Junkers City on the moon Ruigers Landing, orbiting the gas giant Tamol 3 in the Expansion Region. No shrinking violet nor spoilt gangsters brat, Kayla had a sharp intellect and passionate interest in learning and exploration, and she spent many happy hours attended by a personal security droid designated KKS-1P, climbing the mountains and traversing the deserts of Ruigers Landing. She has an avid interest in antiquities and history, and was quite self sufficient and independently minded by the time she was 17.

Tamol 3 and Ruigers Landing had little offer the galaxy other than it was secondary refuelling and refitting station for the Republic Navy and had a maximum security prison. Little to draw attention, but that little was enough for a large Mandalorian fleet to strike deep into Republic territory on a new offensive. The Praetorian Class frigates and station defenses were hopelessly outgunned in the ensuing attack, and soon the inhabitants of Ruigers Landing saw Shaadlar dropships heading for the surface.

Kayla first encounters the crew when she is visiting a local archaeological site investigating some very old ruins, and her father hires the party (their shuttle shot down by Mandalorian fighters shortly before the main attack) to save his daughter when the Mandalorian assault begins.

The ruins are austere, well hidden and project a profound feeling of unease and evil, and it is here the party encounter both Kayla and the archaeologists (from a well known Coruscant University). During everyone taking refuge inside the ruins when a Mandalorian scout force land nearby, a large sarcophagus with words loosely translated as ancient Sith is disturbed and a large black field of Dark side energy is freed and flies up through the roof.

On translating the words on the sarcophagus and the images on the walls, the archaeologists reveal that the words state

They also discover that the tomb is more a prison for someone or something called Thalib Vuschaka, a very old Sith name.

The Peaceful Primates

Squirrel monkeys are becoming an important symbol for wildlife in
Costa Rica. They delight researchers who study them, and weighing
in at just one and a half pounds, with beautiful orange fur and
expressive faces, they are irresistible to tourists. Sue Boinski, a
professor of anthropology and comparative medicine at the
University of Florida, has spent the past 20 years observing
squirrel monkeys in Central and South America. Her research has
revealed that Costa Rica's squirrel monkeys are among the most
egalitarian and least aggressive primates in the world. She
describes them as the peaceful primate in the peaceable kingdom. "I
think they are like the tourists who love to come here to the
tropical beaches," she says with a smile. "They're just looking for
good food and sex."

But the
future of these winsome primates is in doubt. Their forest habitat
is being destroyed at an alarming rate by agribusiness, including
the raising of crops such as palm oil trees and bananas. The
tourist industry is also booming, resulting in new construction and
an increasing human population. The second-growth forest that
squirrel monkeys prefer for the plentiful soft fruits and insects
is rapidly disappearing. If we don't intervene soon to protect
Costa Rica's squirrel monkeys, Boinski warns, the survival of these
endearing primates cannot be assured.

Despite some sort of name, Indian massage was made in Sweden. It is undoubtedly an ancient practice that the majority of monks read in Asia and which brought rear to or perhaps homeland. Shivago Komarpaj is regarded as commonly assumed to include been its originator related this massage style using Thailand, bringing it back home from the size of his travels over 2,500 quite a few ago.

For generations, Buddhist monks taught other men (as women happened to be forbidden to enter our own temples even monks resided) the skills of massage, and a great many Buddhist temples combined spiritual techniques with the best treatments.

There is no one else like YOU. It's certainly not as difficult as you might think to write an autobiography. In fact, it can be a matter of just answering a few questions. Sometimes, even if you're planning a whole book, it may be just good to start simple with the basics of your life history. Maybe you're just interested in sharing your life story with your children and grandchildren.

1. Set a goal for completion. Life is busy and complicated, and you may find yourself putting it off. Set your goal to be an upcoming holiday, or the end of the year. You'll find that a deadline helps keep you motivated.

2. Decide the template you want. There are so many ways you can put your life story together. Decide on a set of questions to use, or just go chronologically. You may want to know more about how LifeBio works.

3. Find a friend you can share the process with. Having a friend or a group of people to complete your life stories with can make the process more enjoyable. It's fun to share

These simple activities can cause a huge difference. Start doing these steps as soon as possible to protect and care for our environment.

If you think that the potential effects of climate change are something we don’t have to worry until the distant future, think again. Drought, floods, and rising temperatures have dealt a blow to agriculture and fishing across the globe. Food production has suffered from lower yields with many crops dying because of lack of irrigation and rain. If left unchecked, the worsening effects of climate change threaten to wipe out some of the planets food sources. Some of the foods that we all stand to lose in the near future if climate change worsens include:

1. Bananas
It seems hard to believe that this common staple that seems to be available everywhere is under threat. But the reality is some banana farmers are already feeling the brunt of rising temperatures. Erratic rainfalls and warmer climates seem to have contributed to the increase of pests that plague on farmers’ crops.

2. Chocolate
The biggest sources of cocoa beans may not be able to produce them by 2100 if temperatures continue to rise. Lack of rainfall and other sources of water to irrigate farmlands likewise exacerbate the problem. If these problems persist, chocolates may become a luxury we can no longer afford – if we see could still see them around at all.

3. Coffee
We might as well enjoy every cup of coffee while we still can. Many coffee-producing countries have been experiencing droughts in recent years. As if these droughts are not enough, excessive rainfalls have also been affecting coffee farmers’ yields. Pests and other species have also affected coffee plantations in many parts of the world.

4. Craft beer
Craft brewers deal with a lot of challenges in producing high quality beers. But it may even become more difficult for them to produce the craft beers if temperatures continue to rise. Drought has already been affecting water sources needed to produce the grains needed to make beer. It could also severely affect the production of hops, which are important components in creating craft beers.

5. Peanut Butter
Peanuts are difficult to grow without sufficient rainfall. Droughts could kill the crops while too much rain can lead to mold growths that can be lethal if ingested. Given abnormal climate conditions, sourcing the main ingredient in making peanut butter could prove much harder than before.

Tampa, Florida -- The city of Tampa is seeking answers from a contractor after one of its workers was caught on video dumping concrete into the Hillsborough River near MacDill Park. The worker was fired.

Matthew Von Dorhre was walking past the Riverwalk project Monday when he saw it happen. "I know it's not the legal, not the right thing to do, but I turned an eye to it," he said.

Then the next day, he saw the same thing. "I couldn't believe they were doing it again the second time," he said.

So he captured the dumping on video with his camera.

A contractor was caught dumping concrete in the Hillsborough River.

And the city wanted answers.

"We told them don't bring any more concrete on site. We need a formal written notice - why, how, how many times. Since then they've told us they'll do their washouts on site, not over the river at all," a city spokesperson said.

A crew from Johnson Bros. was back at the site Thursday and a worker said one person was fired and others have been reprimanded. The company failed to respond to several messages.

A concrete worker was fired and the company put on notice after concrete was dumped in the Hillsborough River.

The city hopes the company changes how it works and moves ahead with the $9 million contract.

"Right now we hope they remedy it. and move forward successfully," the spokesperson said.

Von Dorhre said it's good the city paid attention to the dumping, but the action needs to stop.

"A slap on the wrist may be OK - but if this is something done continuously then that's a problem," he said.

City officials don't expect this to slow the project down, which should be complete by the new year.

The spokesperson added that inspectors were at the site on Thursday and the crew was following proper procedures.

The Hillsborough County Environmental Protection Commission was also onsite to review the disposal area used Thursday, and found it to be acceptable.

"Please remember that the contractor notified us this morning that instead of continuing to dispose of washout on the barge over the River, it would be done on land, which is what these pictures show," the EPC said.

"Johnson Bros. did turbidity tests late Wednesday, which measure the amount of particulates in the

... Tom is walking in this charity walk and you guys are NOT leaving until you donate. ...

"ummm ... Watch us!"

Seriously, you can ignore this kind of badgering. It's unfortunate, but this kind of attempt at guilt tripping and coercion does nothing to aid the charity and actually hurts their efforts in the long run.

But glad to hear that other than this little side event, your Easter at Lake House Sally's went well!

We have a couple of those in our office. They want to raise money by running a marathon at an exotic location, and they sure do not take "no thank you" very well.

The cause itself is okay - but like OP, it is not one I personally support. But what irks me is that the person raising the money gets their training, transportation, hotel and race entry fees "for free" if they raise a total of $3,500. So no wonder they are so pushy. From my calculations, at least half of that goes to cover the participant's expenses. I don't know how others think of it, but it rubs me the wrong way. I mean, what exactly does running an exotic marathon have to do with donating to a charity? I just don't understand why people whom I hardly even know think it is appropriate to ask me to help pay for their exotic vacation, under the guise of "fund raising".

I'll tell you what I told the obnoxious charity organizer at work. We had to fill out forms to have the money taken directly from our paychecks. This organization is one that I have strong feelings against. I filled out the form checking the box that said I chose not to donate. Organizer had a reaction as though I had drop kicked kittens down the hallway. I said "By definition, donation means voluntary. Therefore, I am not obligated in any way to donate to any organization.".

What I find interesting about these things is that if someone just vaguely and politely asks for donations face to face, it's really hard for me to decline, even if I kind of want to--that is, I'm much more likely to donate. But the instant they start getting pushy and obnoxious, bringing it up repeatedly, telling me I "can't" leave until I donate--that's when I dig in my heels and think, I am never giving you a cent, maybe not for anything, ever. Maybe

I am stealing this from Stacy, who stole it from Ali...It sounded fun!Here are the directions:

1. As a comment on my blog, leave one memory that you and I had together. It doesn't matter if you knew me a little or a lot, anything you remember!

2. Next, re-post these instructions on your blog and see how many people leave a memory about you. It's actually pretty funny to see the responses. If you leave a memory about me, I'll assume you're playing the game and I'll come to your blog and leave one about you.

Don, Jessica, and Shalynn came to visit us last week. It's been a fun-filled week with many adventures! We visited the Texas State History Museum in downtown Austin, saw the Congress Bridge bats, canoed down Town Lake, played games, and ate lots of food!

Town Lake from the Congress Bridge. We had a nice relaxing picnic in Zilker Park, then rented a canoe and took turns rowing up and down the river. It was fun! Mason was the only one that brought his swim suit, so he had a fun time swimming. Unfortunately, Jes fell in the river helping Mason out once, but since it was nearly 100 degrees, it was a welcomed cool off. Jes, Don, Shalynn, and Mason were taking the canoe back to the dock, and they decided to let Mason swim one last time in the middle of the river. When he was done, Don and Shalynn were leaning out of the canoe pulling Mason in and a oar fell out the other side. At the same time, they both went to grab it and WHOOSH! We all went flying into the river! Jes came out of the water and immediately looked for Mason who was still in the boat, floating away! He started crying when he realized he was all alone, but Jes and Don swam to him and swam the boat to the shore. Shalynn swam around and gathered all the oars! At the shore, in our attempt to get into the boat, we all fell in again! Then we sunk the canoe! We were able to get the canoe up and emptied and finally got it returned. Completely soaked, we returned the boat to the dock and handed them a wet 20 dollar bill for payment.

Ashlee, Shalynn, and Jes take a turn on the canoe! Ashlee's so

Unlike most slow cooker recipes whch require some pre-cooking, all of these ingredients get mixed right into the pot and then set to stew. It’s too easy – and delicious. Serve with brown rice or your favorite whole grain of choice.

Ingredients:

1/3 cup tomato paste (I use 1 5-ounce can)

4 cloves garlic, chopped

2 tablespoons curry powder

1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger

1 teaspoon cumin

1 medium onion, chopped

2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs (about 10)

salt and pepper

1/2 cup plain yogurt

2 scallions, thinly sliced

Procedure:

In a 4- to 6-quart slow cooker, whisk together the tomato paste, garlic, curry powder, ginger, cumin and 3/4 cup water. Add the onion and stir to combine. Place the chicken on top and season with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.

Cover and cook until the chicken is tender, on low for 7-8 hours or on high for 3-4 hours.

Just before serving, add the yogurt to the chicken, along with salt and pepper to taste. Stir to combine. Serve over rice or other whole grain and garnish with sliced scallions.

This one is now in my go-to recipe file. I’ve made this twice now and both times it received rave reviews. It’s a rich, delicious, heartily spiced dish. The second time I made it boneless, skinless thighs weren’t available, so I bought bone-in thighs with skins and skinned them myself (super quick and easy with kitchen shears). I was planning to debone the thighs after cooking and before serving but the meat was so tender and fell off the bone so easily, that it really wasn’t necessary.

The spices are so wonderful I thought I’d try skipping the salt the second time I made it. However, I found that adding salt at the end really enhances the flavor–definitely recommend not skipping it.

Hi Kristen! We enjoyed this greatly….followed your recipe, then wanted to add more veggies, so I layered two large sliced carrots and 1 cup of peas on top of chicken, a 3/4 more cup of chicken broth, 1/2 cup

It seems like she has been rehearsing nonstop, and I know she's ready for a dance rest, but it was plain to see that she loves dancing. No photography during the performance, so you'll just have to take my word for it: Bambi was really lovely, dancing the Chinese. Her own experience and talent, shone through, and she had a line up of adorable ballet beginners in tow.

Bambi also danced in the snow scenes... would that make her like a snowflake, or a snow fairy? Whichever it was, she looked, top to toes, graceful and poised. Oh, and she danced the waltz, too. It was all so pretty! You can see how proud her mom is.

Alex brought his girlfriend flowers. Here she is with her mom and dad. They've been supporting her dancing for twelve years. And they have good reason to feel proud.

Ahhhhh

I love how dear they are together... a couple that brings out the best qualities in each other.

Well, with Thanksgiving behind us, and a magical night with family together enjoying music and dance, out on the town... looks like the holidays are shining brightly already!

I wanted to say something just like this, Jenny... but it kept sounding a little too sentimental. Now, you've said it, I agree heartily. I was misty eyed and awestruck... those lovely dancers, and all the fluttering grace and beauty. It was wonderful.

She is very talented. I have such a new-found respect for the work behind all that spinning and tip-toeing about... hard, hard work! And we agree... we like seeing her hair up, so we see more of her lovely face!Is it too plotting of me to agree... they do look like they belong together? It's lovely to see my own child in love.

Community meetings have also been held about the proposal. But some members of the neighborhood say the meetings have been fruitless and prompted Saturday's actions.

"We met as a neighborhood with the president of the MTC and realized that they were just going to go ahead with this, so we decided we were going to do what we could do to preserve the neighborhood," neighborhood resident Charlotte England said.

She likens the building to a "monolith" and a "mammoth" and said she worries it will change the feel of her neighborhood or open the door to other large buildings. But she hopes to make it clear that it's simply and wholly about the building and nothing else.

"The main thing we're trying to do is educate people about what's really happening," she said. "Some people think if you oppose the building, then you oppose the church and the leadership, but it's not that at all. We don't oppose the expansion … we just don't want it that tall."

This is reiterated by Evans, who said he sometimes feels a "terrible angst" about whether opposition to the building will be misinterpreted and that it's an angst he hoped to avoid.

"This is not a LDS Church issue," he said. "It's a building issue and should be treated as such."

Evans is the chairman of the neighborhood, but he said this issue expands beyond his own backyard to the whole city. That's why he has launched a citywide petition, hopes to meet with Provo Mayor John Curtis and officials at BYU and decided to spearhead the efforts.

"I talked to people all over the city and said, 'Is this something we should take a stand on? Is it worthy of our best effort?' and the overwhelming response was, 'Absolutely,'" Evans said.

The balloons are reusable and Evans said they will be used in the coming months. They are also hoping to advance their petition online.

But Tom Schumann, the neighborhood's vice chairman, said he is in full support of the proposed building. He thinks it's the best solution for both the present and the future.

"To me, it makes sense if they can just tear down the buildings and continue operations without having to curtail the MTC too much," he said. "The other thing is, looking at the area on the Google maps, there's not much room for expansion. … It might allow for

3. Philadelphia 76ers
(SF, PF/C) – The Sixers were dubbed “Tankadelphia” this year and the consensus all along was that the front office wanted to land Wiggins. They didn’t get the pick they wanted but they will get the player they coveted.

Selection – Andre Wiggins, SF – University of Kansas

4. Orlando Magic
(PG, PF) – I’m hearing Noah Vonleh’s name mentioned here now along with Dante Exum. While the team was impressed with Exum, the overwhelming need for a PG will outweigh everything else.

Selection – Dante Exum, PG – Australia

5. Utah Jazz
(SF, G, F) – The Jazz are forming a nice young nucleus with Trey Burke, Derek Favors and RFA Gordon Hayward. Add to that Enes Kanter and Alec Burks and the team has a nice young piece at each position on the floor. Look for them to try desperately to trade down but if they stay look for them to add a security blanket at SF or more backcourt depth.

6. Boston Celtics
(Scorer, SG, F) – The Celtics need a legit scoring threat and could also use help at SG and F. Marcus Smart, Aaron Gordon and Julius Randle are names I am hearing right now tied to Boston. Many people think the Celtics are leaning towards Gordon but I simply don’t think they can pass up the scoring ability of Marcus Smart.

Selection – Marcus Smart, SG – Oklahoma State University

7. Los Angeles Lakers
(Everything) – Julius Randle is an option here and would fill a huge hole for the Lakers but I have heard now from two separate Western Conference scouts that the team absolutely loves PG Elfrid Payton and feels he could be a Rajon Rondo type with a better offensive game. This will all come down to opinions on Randle’s previously broken foot.

Selection – Elfrid Payton, PG – University of Louisiana at Lafayette

8. Sacramento Kings
(C, Defender, PG) – The Kings could use a defensive center that would allow Cousins to move over to his natural PF position. With no center worthy of this pick, why not keep Cousins at center and add a defensive minded PF.

Selection – Aaron Gordon, PF – University of Arizona

9. Charlotte Hornets(from Detroit

How does intermittent fasting work?

To understand how intermittent fasting leads to fat loss we first need to understand the difference between the fed state and the fasted state.

Your body is in the fed state when it is digesting and absorbing food. Typically, the fed state starts when you begin eating and lasts for three to five hours as your body digests and absorbs the food you just ate. When you are in the fed state, it’s very hard for your body to burn fat, but not impossible, because your insulin levels are high.

After that timespan, your body goes into what is known as the post–absorptive state, which is just a fancy way of saying that your body isn’t processing a meal.
The post–absorptive state lasts until eight to 12 hours after your last meal, which is when you enter the fasted state. It is much easier for your body to burn fat in the fasted state because your insulin levels are low.

When you’re in the fasted state your body can burn fat that has been inaccessible during the fed state.

Benefits of Intermitting fasting.

There is loads of scientific research into the health benefits of intermittent fasting but I’m going to tell you the benefits I experienced.

• Easy to follow
This plan was so easy to follow. I stopped eating at 9pm and didn’t eat again until 1pm – it’s not rocket science.

• I didn’t feel hungry
Well, a little around 12pm each day an hour before I was due to eat. Normally I would feel like I would pass out if I didn’t eat my breakfast before leaving the house but I believe I didn’t get hungry because my body knew what I was doing and didn’t actually need food.

• I was early for work!
Normally in the mornings I take boot camp, do my own work out and then go home to shower, change and eat before rushing out the door but because I was intermittent fasting I didn’t have to worry about breakfast.

• I needed to change
After I carried out my six-week transformation I found myself snacking a lot at night. I wasn’t on a restricted diet anymore and my football season wasn’t starting for a few months so I needed a new plan. That plan was fasting and it cut out all my late night snacking.

• I could control

If you're a fancy type person and have a special dimpled plate made specifically to nestle deviled eggs than by all means do slice them up the regular way. BUT if you are minimalist or garden gnomey like myself then do as I do and cleave right through their fat lil tummies. The trick is to knick just a teensy sliver off each pointy end so each half stands on it's own. (This is easier to do as the first step before halving.)

Dissect all the eggs and scoop their gorgeous yolky innards into a small bowl. Mash with a fork, add the mayo and mustard and continue to combine until smooth.

Mix in the cumin, salt, hot sauce. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. If it's looking chalky, add a spoonful more mayo.

At this point you can refrigerate everything -- the empty whites and deviled mixture -- until ready to prep and serve.

An easy way to store is to ever so slightly oil the inside of a large plastic kitchen baggie. Scoop the mixture in and squish it to one of the corners, twisting off the empty space to make a makeshift pastry bag. This also helps keep it very airtight while storing.

When ready to assemble: Get all the toppings ready!

In a small skillet at medium high heat melt a nub of butter or glug of oil. When the pan is very hot, add the corn and let it sizzle and spat. Allow the corn to develop some heavy color, stirring occasionally to evenly brown. 5-8 minutes.

Take the pan off the heat and set aside.

Line up all your whites, and snip the corner off on the mixture-baggie. Holding a white in one hand, baggie in the other -- pipe a generous amount into each egg white cup, letting it dome over the top. Try to make it look pretty and smooth but don't freak out if the first few look a little sad -- they will soon be showered in toppings and gobbled right up.

Once all the whites are filled, set them on your serving plate. Line up all the toppings, small bowls work well.

I prefer to use a small spoon with the corn to sit a few kernals on each egg and lightly press them in so that they don't fall. But that is where

Yeah, I’m crazy. What else am I doing? I’m watching this movie and it’s like playing games with old men: every move seems to matter. But with whom am I allied, at this nondescript age, this age of bastards hiding food in their socks? The thing is just to dig and get nowhere. To go on digging like there’s a place underground, to never get dragged to the surface by your hair. To not get got. To shit in a can and eat it with your fingers but never get found out, never beaten with sticks, or ordered about like some idiot animal, or seen disrobed and unarmed as only good for one thing. I hear the good times are over. It comes from a man threatening to fuck someone’s mutter. His pants are full up, in Berlin, to strains of Mozart. When I return from the kiosk the cinema is empty. But then piled up in a heap right at the back I see they’re still there. For the love of God give me a weapon. My heart is going nowhere and the sun is set to kill us all. My heart, I find, is where they cram in all the crowds; and if I’d known they’d all be drinking, I’d have placed it farther away, where the women like to sleep late—in case they’re early for being alive. The infants they carry are the size of fists and made of shrapnel. Milked or not, they save themselves for holidays and funerals. They say, You call that a face? They say, We’d rather eat you than make room for a cow. Fascists is a password they use: it means Hitler is crying in his sleep. We’ll all be asked one day whether we’re wounded or sick, and we’ll be expected to know. But I realize now I’m barely alive: I don’t hear the birds singing, my skin is box-calf leather, and what I took to be tertiary syphilis is just guinea pigs howling. I’m watching families die, families with only one arm, and no balls, and all its dongs ripped out like baby hair. The whole cinema’s sitting soaked in gasoline, when no one has a light. And still the wolf walks on like it’s snuggling in a woman’s tits, like a guy drunk on vodka he made out of soap

Discussions about data may need to become as integral to military operational planning as kinetic weapons and physical targets, say two of the top cyber leaders in the U.S. Defense Department.

Gen. Paul Nakasone, USA, director of the National Security Agency and commander of U.S. Cyber Command, and Dana Deasy, Defense Department chief information officer, stressed the importance of data during a fireside chat on the first day of the AFCEA TechNet Cyber conference in Baltimore.

Gen. Nakasone indicated that data may need to considered during operational planning. “We have to ensure that we understand how we apply nonkinetic power in a way we haven’t done before. We’re very, very familiar with understanding the planning process that goes to kinetic operations. Nonkinetic operations, I would say, are sometimes as important,” he said. “When we look at our military planning process, we identify named areas of interest and targeted areas of interest. Data could well be one of those named areas of interest that we have to have to focus on, that we have to watch, that we have to have an understanding of how it’s changing.”

Deasy agreed, suggesting that data become a part of cadet training. He said he tells the secretaries of the military services to show him the curriculum that teaches young cadets about the importance of data and how it can be used offensively and defensively. “There’s a lot more we could be doing there,” Deasy added. “This is a really big opportunity. We need to start introducing new skill sets to people who are very young coming in.”

Dana Deasy, @DoD_CIO says we are on the verge of a data explosion and stresses the important of data to the military and intelligence mission.#AFCEATechNet#AFCEACyber

At the same time, military leaders should ensure flag officers understand the importance of data as well, Deasy added. “At the opposite end, we need to make accessible these conversations that may be uncomfortable or non-natural with some flag officers around this topic. We have to attack both ends of the spectrum to create that education and awareness.”

“We didn’t think about that when I was going through the military schools, and now we need to. I think that’s an important piece,” Gen. Nakasone responded.

Deasy then reported that in the past three or four months, representatives from

1939 was the day when the producer was king, so after years of effort, most of the credit for getting Gone With The Wind to the screen with such painstaking craft deservingly goes to mega-producer David O. Selznick. The film's original director, George Cukor, was fired a few weeks into production when Selznick decided his vision wasn’t up to snuff. Gable’s bud, director Victor Fleming, took over and finished the film (though Sam Wood also did some time in the hot seat when Fleming went down). To work on Gone With The Wind, Fleming had to leave TheWizard of Oz early and is credited as the director on both films.

The film was shot in vibrant colors by journeyman cinematographer Ernest Haller (Jezebel, Rebel Without A Cause). Its believable looking Southern locations were actually a number of Hollywood back lots often with matte backgrounds. The special effects, most memorably the Burning Of Atlanta, were way ahead of their time. And, of course, Max Steiner’s memorably lush score still has the ability to give goose bumps.

The cast is top notch, even when their roles can come off as cartoony. For Clark Gable, Rhett Butler is the role he was born for. Rhett represents the accumulation of the rogue charm Gable had been mastering for the last decade. British matinee star Leslie Howard is perfect as the do-gooder, Ashley, though he never fully embraces the Southern accent and sometimes seems like he would be more comfortable reading sonnets in a London pub than running a Georgia plantation. (He would die just a few years later working for the British government when his plane was shot down by German bombers). For Olivia de Havilland, fine as Melanie, it was just a warm-up for her major roles to come (The Dark Mirror, The Heiress, etc.), as she would prove to be one of the more interesting actresses of the next decade and a half.

After a highly publicized search for the actress to play Scarlett, where most major actresses in Hollywood tested and were considered (including Barbara Stanwick, Katharine Hepburn, and most seriously Bette Davis), Paulette Goddard almost got the role until in walked the young British beauty Vivien Leigh, fresh off becoming Miss Laurence Olivier, after playing Ophelia to his Hamlet at the Old

I remember getting a lot of glossy pamphlets from prospective colleges during my senior year of high school and thinking about what it might be like to spend four years of my life at each of them. I prided myself on being a good student, earning above-average grades in my school’s rigorous International Baccalaureate program. I was rewarded with acceptance letters from nearly every college to which I applied.
But I soon learned I was naïve to think that only hard work mattered in getting into the college of my dreams. In fact, one part of my background counted more than anything else — my immigration status.
I am an undocumented immigrant. I came with my parents and younger sister from Cordoba, Argentina, when I was 5 years old. My dad had visited Florida before we moved here and thought it was a good place to start a business and give his children opportunities we could not have in Argentina.
My parents are business owners in Miami. They pay their taxes. We are like any other family in our community. But when I opened my acceptance letter from my chosen school, Miami Dade Honors College, and saw that tuition would be triple the amount paid by other Florida students, it became clear we weren’t treated like other families. That’s when I learned that Florida prohibits DREAMers like me from receiving in-state tuition at its public universities. My immigration status could be the one thing that stopped me from getting the education I had worked so hard to achieve.
Luckily, a year later, MDC waived out-of-state tuition. Now I was able to afford school, since the honors college scholarship covered all of the in-state tuition and fees.
But I want to stand up against a law that unfairly singles out undocumented students brought to America as children and makes it harder for us to be successful in what we’re told again and again is a difficult job market, especially for those with less education. I’m writing this for my sister, who is 15 months younger than me and currently applying to college. We know from my experience that she will likely not be able to attend her dream school because of high tuition.
She has accepted that this is how it goes. But she shouldn’t have to.
Floridians — including Gov. Rick Scott and many in the Legislature — recognize that singling out undocumented students is bad for students’ futures and, ultimately, bad for the state’s economy. A bill in the Florida Senate, SB

If you don’t have a mixer or would rather knead the dough with you hands, place the dough on a floured surface and knead until smooth, adding a little more flour as needed (about 8-10 minutes). The dough may still be a bit sticky, but shouldn’t be overly so.

Instructions

Mix the yeast, brown sugar, and warm cider in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Let sit for 5 minutes and allow the yeast to proof, it will foam up. Then add the eggs, salt, buttermilk, melted butter, pumpkin, vanilla, 2 1/2 cups flour, and 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon, mix on medium until combined. Continue slowly adding the remaining 1/2 cup of flour until it is all incorporated. The dough will be sticky. At this point begin adding 1 tablespoon of flour at a time until the dough pulls away from the sides and forms a smooth ball (about 4-6 minutes).

Spray a bowl with cooking spray and place the dough inside, cover with some plastic wrap on top. Let rise for 1-2 hours in a warm spot, or until doubled in size.

Turn the dough onto a floured work surface. Roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about an 1/8 inch thick. Use a knife or pastry cutter to cut into 3×3 inch squares (about 50 squares).Scoop out a scant teaspoon of Nutella and place in the middle of a square. Gently place another square on top and pinch the sides together. Fold each side in about 1/4 inch and pinch again. It is VERY important that the beignet is well sealed. If not, it could pop open while it fries and all the filling will spill out!

Place a deep, heavy bottom pot on the stove and add enough oil to fill the pot about 1 to 1 1/2 inches deep. Turn the burner to medium and preheat the oil to 350 degrees F. Fry 4-6 beignets at a time depending on the size of your pot. Use a slotted spoon to flip them over every 30 seconds. Fry for 2-3 minutes or until golden brown on both sides. If they are taking longer than 3 minutes to brown you need to turn your burner up and make sure your oil is at the correct temperature. Remove with the slotted spoon and place on paper

However, addressing concerns that the weapons were being fired at young people, Mr Chesterman warned against using Tasers as an "easy option" to tackle people threatening to harm themselves.

"I'm not saying Tasers are risk free ... but the risk from the electricity is very low," he said.

"If there was a mission creep, where officers used it as the easy option to deal with something, that would cause me concern. It's not a compliance tool."

He added: "When you hear a 12-year-old being Tasered, it sounds awful. It doesn't mean it wasn't lawful, but it does sound bad.

"From what I've read about that particular case, the individual was intent on self-harming. It may well be that Taser saved her life."

Speaking at a briefing at ACPO's headquarters in central London, Mr Chesterman said he had some concerns about the use of "drive-stunning", where the Taser is held directly against a person's body.

When used in this mode, the weapon causes increased pain rather than "neuromuscular incapacitation" by disrupting the voluntary control of muscles.

Combustion had also occurred in "very rare cases" when Tasers were fired and officers are warned of the increased risk associated with using CS spray, Mr Chesterman added.

An forthcoming report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is expected to address concerns about Tasers being used on people with mental health issues and those threatening self harm.

Many forces across England and Wales are expected to reveal a "significant increase" in their use of the weapons since 2009 when Home Office figures are published at the end of the month.

They are equipped with the X26 Taser which has a peak voltage of 50,000 volts when discharged but drops to 1,200 volts while travelling around the body at a current of 0.0021 amps.

About 8,000 additional Tasers were introduced to police forces between 2009 and 2010, ACPO said.

Nearly 13,800 officers across 43 forces in England and Wales are trained to use the weapons – about 10% of the total force.

The Police Federation has called for every front line police officer to be equipped with the guns.

Hijacking the truck, the squad then proceeds to the rendezvous point, being chased by Quad-Bikes, Vodniks, and finally a Mi-28 HavocAttack Helicopter. Marlowe is told to take out the Mi-28 using his grenade launcher to hit the pilot.

The helicopter's crash turns over the truck, and, after exiting the vehicle, the squad finds a box containing a component to the Russian superweapon. When they return to Base, General Braidwood tells them it's a fake and that they need to get the information on the real weapon from Agent Aguire in Bolivia. He recruits them to the Special Activities Division and sends them on their way. Sweetwater becomes excited to be in the Special Forces by saying "Hell fucking yes!", but Redford sees the situation as another postponement to his retirement.

When defending themselves in the stolen truck, try to use the grenade launcher against the Russian Quad Bikes and the Vodniks because it can be quite useful as it creates large damage upon them, even the Mi-28 Havoc near the tunnel at the end can be destroy by one hit from it.

When repelling the enemy counterattack inside the house, player can destroy the houses in front of them with Destruction 2.0, as it will leave the enemy with no cover, which can be quite useful but still harder to aim and destroy the houses in a short time while engaging the enemy.

The level's name is a play-on-words, as it is called Cold War due to the cold environment that the player fights in, and the fact that it is a conflict between Russia and United States.

Braidwood's office contains several easter eggs during the mission's end cutscene, including:

The Legionnaire's "Acta Non Verba" insignia along with one of the "Smiley" grenade pins from the first game. The board also has what appears to be concept art of Kirilenko tacked on it.

Cheers to you and your brother from L.A. — I love reading accounts of people with the fortitude to do the right thing when others would sit back and wait. Very brave indeed. I will continue to keep tabs on the recall effort and hope it works out in favor of the public employees of Wisconsin — and in favor of sane leadership.

Please ask him to run for governor!!! I met him the day of ‘The Great Return,’ shook his hand as he came out of the long press conference. He was still wearing the same leather jacket that he had on for all those Rachel Maddow interviews. I was so moved by all 14, including my own fresh young Senator, Chris Larson. Then I heard your bro speak at the big rally in May. He lifts the spirits of all us beleaguered Wisconsinites! What an antidote he would be to what we now have in Madison!!

Thanks for sharing your story of your brother- Last February/ spring of 2011 was one of significance. So glad that he is my wonderful WI State Senator! He is an excellent leader & WI needs many more people just like him!

My words don’t adequately express my gratitude for your brother, his wisdom, and his calming presence. Jon represents all that is good in our wonderful state. Thank you Mary for your beautiful words. Your mother must be so proud of you two!

Thank you Mary and thank you John. I’ll never forget the day we met at the Old Fashioned, after a recall rally in August, you saw my little homemade name tag with my Twitter handle and avatar and the familiar hashtag #WIunion. I was so happy when you jumped up and said I know you! Then you and your brother both stopped to say hi to me and my daughter.

I’ll never forget how proud I was to tell others that John was my State Senator and I got to meet him and his incredible sister!

Loved your writing, it is nice that you have each other. I have 5 sisters and 4 brothers and it is a bond you can’t break! I too would like to thank Jon and the others as well, I know it was a great sacrifice, they made for us. I along with 2 of my sisters made it to Madison to several rallies, and got to shake all their hands. It was one of the proudest moments in my life to stand with all those wonderful people from all walks of life, from all communities

Twenty-five families who have overcome diabetes caused by a defect in a single gene will gather at "Celebrating the Miracles," a University of Chicago symposium for patients, parents and physicians. The first Monogenic Diabetes Forum is designed to review scientific studies, celebrate treatment successes, stress the importance of a genetic diagnosis for children diagnosed before age one, and exchange tips on how to make the most of a new concept--life without insulin injections.

The two-day symposium--from 1:15 pm on Thursday, July 8, to 4:15 pm on Friday, July 9--will take place at the University of Chicago's Gleacher Center, 455 CityFront Plaza, in downtown Chicago.

A separate symposium for physicians and scientists on clinical, biomedical and genetic advances follows from 8:30 am to 1:30 pm on Saturday, July 10.

Although single-gene or "monogenic" diabetes has interested scientists for years, it was often viewed by physicians as a laboratory curiosity. That changed in August 2006 when two research teams showed that a widely used, inexpensive medication developed for type 2 diabetes could restore normal insulin secretion in patients with what appeared to be type 1 diabetes when the disease was caused by one of two specific genetic flaws.

This meant that a small number of children diagnosed very early in life--before the age of one--could stop having their blood sugars constantly tested day and night and receiving multiple insulin shots. Instead, they swallow a few pills two or three times a day.

Because this life-altering discovery affected so few people, an estimated 2,000 cases in the United States, it did not immediately reach the parents of children with neonatal diabetes. But just as the studies were being published, Lilly Jaffe, a highly photogenic six-year-old girl from Chicago's northern suburbs, started taking her pills. Diagnosed at one month of age and reliant on insulin ever since, she was able to disconnect her insulin pump. A page-one story in the Chicago Tribune about Lilly's miraculous "cure" was soon being copied, passed around and emailed by the parents of children with early-onset diabetes.

"She quickly became the poster child for personalized medicine," said her doctor, diabetes specialist Louis Philipson, MD, PhD, professor of medicine at the University of Chicago. "Within a couple months we had begun the transition off of insulin for children from as far away as Alaska and Florida. Now we have a national registry of infants

Oh, Ruthie, I think you may have wrote the book that every mother, every wife, can relate to. I'm neither, yet I still felt the deep struggles that Amber went through in Making It Last. Giving everything you have to these people you love, yet not knowing who you are anymore. Being the one that everyone relies on, yet secretly wanting time to yourself, time to rely on someone else for a change. I have yet to experience the things that Amber has, but that didn't stop me from understanding and relating to her in the book. Simply put: thank you for writing Amber and Tony's “after the HEA” novella!

Like with all of Knox's previous books, Making It Last is very emotional (many readers say they cried; I'm rarely one to cry while I read, but I'll admit I was close a few times in this one!), very believable and real, not to mention sexy. There are a few fun, kind of light parts, but MIL is not a book that is going to make you laugh from begin to end. And that's okay, because that's not the story that needed to be told anyway.

4.5 STARS! Finally, a romance novel (er, novella) that takes place AFTER the infamous HEA, showing readers what life is like once the “I can't live without you let's make love for the rest of our lives” phase is over. Making It Last tells the story of finding love again, after years of marriage and kids and work and stress and, well, just life in general. It's the story of how Amber and Tony find each other again, as well as finding themselves a bit, too. I read it straight through, took me maybe an hour or so, and loved every minute of it! If you've read the rest of this series, you won't be disappointed! If you haven't read the previous books—what are you waiting for? Sure, you can read this one as a standalone, but you'll get a much better idea of how the couple came to this point in their life if you start with book 1. Plus, Ruthie Knox is such a talented and wonderful author that you will definitely enjoy exploring every new couple in Camelot! Now all I have to say is this: Ruthie, please write Patrick's story! Oh, and keep up the great work, I cannot wait to read your next book, no matter what it is! :D

The latest Destiny 2 update brings just a couple of small changes, along with decorating the Tower in red for the Crimson Days event. Hotfix 1.1.2.1 removes the Lost Sector throttle that was a quick fix for a previous exploit, now making it so that players can only open one Lost Sector chest per boss defeated. Here are the very brief patch notes.

With the big end-of-month patch only two weeks away, we’re likely to get additional details from Bungie soon on what exactly they’ve been able to cram into the coming Destiny 2 update. Today’s small fix is only a bandage, where the major updates will do surgery to change the game.

While Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom was delayed until March 23, 2018 that doesn’t mean we’re not getting new information. Bandai Namco just released an interesting new video showing off the game’s original soundtrack. The three minute video is a great look at what you can expect from Joe Hisaishi and the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra.

Check out the newly released Ni no Kuni II soundtrack trailer below:

If you want even more information on Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom, you can always check our E3 preview:

Every so often a truly unique gem rises above the rest of the games, and some of these titles are strong enough to shine long far beyond their release year. Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch is one such game, having landed as our RPG of the year in 2013 in spite of it being an English port of the Japanese version that released in 2011. That’s right, it was that good. Ni no Kuni meshes stunning Studio Ghibli style art with some of the best JRPG mechanics to create one of the few games that I was ever sad to get a Platinum on, just because the adventure had come to an end.

The announcement of Ni no Kuni 2 has me back on the edge of my seat and E3 2017 finally gave me a chance to go hands-on with it, if only for a brief period. Once again, Level 5 is blurring the line between interactivity and animation. Headed by an all-star development team straight from Studio Ghibli, and the same team that made the first game, Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom is in good hands.

SPU Mentor Program Tracks

The SPU Mentor Program offers three tracks, each track designed to help you either discern your career goals or help you prepare for them. The correct track for you is dependent on numerous factors, but you might be drawn to a particular track based upon how certain you are regarding your current career goal. Chances are, at least one of our tracks will be helpful to you. During your program interview, we will ensure that you have selected the right track to suit your current needs.

The Three Mentor Tracks

Mentor

The Mentor track is good for any student hoping to grow and develop his or her professional skills and knowledge. In this program, you will meet with a professional who has been hand-selected according to your needs and preferences. On average, you and your mentor will meet three to five times over a period of six to twelve months. The actual frequency varies according to you and your mentor’s availability. During these meetings, you may ask candid questions of your mentor, and will develop a more in-depth relationship.

Depending on your goals, you might receive coaching or advice about a specific career. This advice might include information about what a career looks like, how to get there, and what you could be doing now in preparation for your future.

Perhaps you don’t have a specific career in mind. Instead, you want an established professional as a mentor, someone with a specific mindset or background, who can talk to you about the challenges that everyone faces in the work place: work/life balance, faith integration in the marketplace, or emotionally coping with a demanding job. Perhaps your soft skills need help, and you seek the guidance of a professional as you develop them further.

Your goals are up to you. We find a mentor based on your specific needs.

Job Shadow

During a job shadow, a student typically follows one professional for half a day (roughly 4 hours).

This program is useful for someone who isn’t certain of his or her specific path. Perhaps you want to make sure the work matches your mental image. Perhaps you don’t know if you want to work for a large firm or for a small firm. Perhaps you don’t know if you want to be in a nonprofit or for-profit setting. Observing a workplace and job firsthand can help you answer those questions.

why not get in

Have I been acting happy, carefree and successful, or am I really those things? Am I really myself, then? And if I'm not, why am I acting like this? And if I'm only acting, why do I not know what I'm hiding from?

Why am I asking myself this? Am I afraid to be myself? Am I afraid of having a white boyfriend? And why do I sometimes feel like I don't fit in anywhere?

Sometimes I feel like I don't think the same way my peers do, and that scares me, because then I'm afraid that I won't have any friends. And then, I find that I think the same way G and the like think. Maybe I was born in the wrong country. But I hate to think that way, because I love Malaysia. I love being Malaysian and I wish I was more like my friends. But if I was, I'd probably be as fearful, unadventurous and self-centred as them (generalisation).

Not that I'm not.

But I like to think I'm more world-savvy, if not Malaysia-savvy.

Perhaps I've just gotta wait a few more years for the answers. To gain more wisdom. Or maybe I just need time to settle down in this new stage of my life.

Haven't had time to select and resize photos yet, but thought I'd unveil my new plan first!

Since I'm always wondering what things mean, and why things are the way they are, I thought it'd be nice if other people could also send in their questions and get their answers here. Course, I don't know how many people will really do that! But thought I'd give it a try.

So do leave your questions in the Comments section after the newest post, and sleep better at night :P

She is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman. And you know what? I don't think that I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor.

&nbsp

Michael: I know we have to register as a consensual sexual relationship with HR. My question: do I do it as the man? Does she do it as my superior? I don't know. That leads to other issues that we may have in our relationship. It's, uh, [phone rings] Excuse me. Hello? Hi! Just talking about you. The camera? No. Uh huh. How's traffic? I miss you. What. Ok. Well, if it was a mistake, it was a wonderful mistake. No. [to camera] Would you excuse me? [to Jan] No, I did not intentionally get you drunk. Um hmm. No, no. [goes under his desk] This is just a fight. This is just a first fight of many fights we're gonna have. Right. No. Wha-so-I don't understand, you wanna see other people. Only other people. Wh-why, ok, I think you're still a little bit drunk [to camera which is now under desk] Excuse me? Excuse me?! [to Jan] I think you're, yes, why don't you just come back here, go to the hotel, have a few drinks and-no, no. I didn't slip you something!

The Libraries’ Closet

Like so many leather skirts, go-go boots and seersucker jackets that need to be carefully stowed in the interim between their respective periods in vogue, these great buildings of books, too, need to occasionally clear space for more useful, timely purposes.

To that end, the Libraries have thus far accommodated a need for additional “closet space” through the construction of off-site warehouses much reminiscent of the one imagined in the closing scene of Raiders of the Lost Ark, seemingly endless rows of shelving stretched from concrete floor to stories-tall rafter, where once-prized tomes and formerly-current periodicals can reside until such time as they are once again called upon to provide the critical information needed to complete some important research or solve some lingering question.

These library storage facilities (LSFs) house those low-circulation items and fragile materials that might be considered complementary resources for collections from across the campus of The University of Texas at Austin and beyond. Both the Harry Ransom Center and the Briscoe Center for American History are reliant upon this remote storage in order to free up room for the more high-value, high-use items in their ever-growing collections of cultural artifacts. Likewise, as parts of the Libraries’ valuable print collection are accessed less frequently than in the past, it’s logical to move those volumes into a high-quality storage environment and establish systems for retrieving books as scholars request them from storage. The migration creates space that can be repurposed for student use and newer technologies to facilitate a more productive, modern learning environment.

The Libraries also enjoined sibling rivals at College Station in two of the ventures thus far — the second of two facilities at the Pickle Research campus in North Austin, and a joint library facility (JLF) at Texas A&M’s Riverside campus outside of Bryan, Texas. In a collaboration that seeks to minimize the physical presence of materials while still availing the needs of institutions across the state, UT and A&M have pared some of their collections to a single-copy that is then shared cross-organizationally through a delivery system coordinated by the principals. The Austin unit constructed in 2010 is already at capacity, and the Riverside unit, which opened in 2013, has incorporated nearly half a million volumes to date. Given the successful outcomes of the partnership, there are already considerations for the development of further partnerships.

Mo,I just thought a fully chromed air rifle would be a unique novelty item. Also, with a mirror finish and with it reflecting the environment around you, it may be virtually invisible as you lurk in the brush. Hmmm…anybody have a chrome pistol they can test that out with? I think a polished chrome sliding cylinder would look good on your black rifle,too. Just the top part that shows when the chamber is closed, maybe.

Derrick,Do you have a picture of the Feinwerkbau? The competition rifles I’ve seen come with some really radical color schemes.

I haven't shot the FX Cyclone, but I plan on getting one too.. I've never compared them.. but I loved the Timberwolf, especially after the LDC.. The only reason I haven't got one yet, is my focus on field target rifles.. and my inability to pass on a good deal on a collectable of sorts…I like the full size AAs410 in the field target stock from the AA400 MPR FT, with the knee rest.. in the sitting position, I like the slightly heavier rifle.. but if I was hunting, which is what both the AAs410 and FX Cyclone were designed for, then light is very important… but like me, some people are doing the single shot mag insert for FT… (Does the Cyclone have one available?), hunting very little, and look for the heavier rifle.. depends of ones focus, I guess..

But I still say there's not going to be that much difference in accuracy.. most of the comments are on weight and smoothness of action.. and the new side lever has got to be darn close as smooth as any. .. not enough to matter.. and with the after market mag from RC machine, it's might be smoother (were those commented on?).. mine feels like 2 lbs or less and re-tracks perfect smooth now..

I hope now and in the past, I haven't come across as putting down the others, as much as praising what my AAs410 .177 has done for me.. I praise and/or poop poo as I see them.. haven't seen the FX Cyclone yet, and I'm so glad you can report to us!!

Congrats on your purchase.. it's great to do it early enough to enjoy all year!!… and also there is more time to break the pledge.. especially if you make

I have a question for all you folks that regularly come to this blog and call people and schools nasty names: Why do you seek this blog and 49er fans and alumni? Obviously you have schools you like better than us; why don't you go to their blogs and concentrate on your favorite school? There is nothing wrong with people who went to UNC Charlotte openly rooting for its sports teams and getting excited about the birth of a new sport. If you want to debate, fine. Let's do it. But let's be adults about it and leave out the name-calling and vulgarity.

Here's the irony, you pathetic trolls: you say "no one cares" but, alas, HERE you are spending YOUR time and ATTENTION here. You think your angry, envy-ridden comments bother NINER NATION? I think not. We have a great school, with great athletic programs and NOW WE HAVE FOOTBALL!! Nothing you can do about it. HAHAHHAAHAHAHA! Now, I look forward to your wasting more time here commenting on the next NINER success story. See you then, losers! GO NINERS!!

As a proud niners fan, I may not be happy with BB & Judy at this time and reserve the right to express myself. I've already booked my room for the A10 tournament.

However,this is a football subject and that's a different ballgame. I love it when when the program is attacked. That is just evidence that the school is relevant (and indeed feared). "Fear the gold pick"

again, why are uncc critics "uneducated" or "poor" or "unqualified for acceptance to of all the public nc schools, uncc"...? i have yet to receive a legitimate and reasonable answer. you guys are like republicans with your unfounded talking points.

@9:29You asked this at 11:46 and it was answered at 11: 54. Go back and read. Perhaps a simple analogy that even you can understand will suffice. This blog is like our living room. Your posts are like turds left behind after defecating in our living room. We do not like turds in our living room. Since you can't understand that you must not be very bright.

Unless you’ve been living in a cave for the last few decades, you’ve no doubt absorbed society’s message that you can buy your way to a happier life. From the minute we wake up until our eyes close at bedtime, we’re bombarded with splashy ads and commercials promising us the world—for a price, of course.

Elizabeth and Nate Thames were an archetypical couple of our consumerist world. In 2014, this pair of professionals was holding down high-powered jobs, living in the city and pulling in big bucks. The world was theirs for the taking.

But one day, they decided they’d had enough of that lifestyle. They were sick of wishing away their workdays and desperately counting down until the weekends. They wanted to start living genuinely and enjoying each day to the fullest.

Together, they hatched a plan: They’d sock away as much money as possible to become modern-day homesteaders in rural Vermont. They called themselves “the Frugalwoods,” and as soon as they put their plan into action, starting by saving more than 70 percent of their income, Elizabeth began documenting their progress on the couple’s popular blog. In less than three years, the Thameses had achieved their goal and reached financial independence at the age of 32. They are now living on a 66-acre homestead in Vermont, together with their little girl.

In her book, Meet the Frugalwoods, Elizabeth retells the eye-opening story of how her financially comfortable family disengaged from the race of keeping up with the Joneses and drastically scaled back their spending to live their dream life. The book is a compelling read that will make spenders of any level stop and think about the choices and financial habits that direct their lives.

You don’t need to be harboring a secret dream of quitting your day job and moving to the woods to enjoy this book. Most of us can stand to cut back on our consumerism for living with a bit more frugality. Meet the Frugalwoods encourages readers to examine their possessions and physical comforts, as well as to determine which of those add genuine joy and value to their lives. Only things that are truly valuable to you are worth holding onto. As Elizabeth says, the process of cutting back and bowing out of society’s peer pressure is enormously liberating.

Thousands of readers have found Meet the Frugalwoods to be an inspiring

Central to Beijing's calculation is interference in the succession process whereby Beijing claims the right to designate the Dalai Lama's religious successor and, in doing so, exploit sectarian and factional divisions within Tibetan Buddhism.

Beijing insists the reincarnation process must follow the Tibetan religious tradition since the Qing dynasty, meaning that it must occur within Tibetan territory and with the central government's endorsement, a process that highlights Tibet's position as a part of China, not an independent entity.

the Dalai Lama has discussed the potential for succession through emanation rather than reincarnation. This would place his knowledge and authority in several individuals, each with a part of his spiritual legacy, but none as the single heir.

In doing so, he is attempting to create a sense of continuity to the Tibetan movement even though his spiritual successor has not been identified. However, it also separates the Dalai Lama from any Tibetan political movement, theoretically making it easier for the spiritual leader and Beijing to come to an accord about his possible return as a spiritual -- but not political -- leader.

But the maneuvering by the Dalai Lama reflects a deeper reality. The Tibetan movement is not homogenous. Tibetan Buddhism has several schools that remain in fragile coordination out of respect for the Dalai Lama. The Tibetan political movement is also fragmented, with the younger foreign-born Tibetans often more strongly pressing for independence for Tibet, while the older exiles take a more moderate tone and call for more autonomy. The peaceful path promoted by the Dalai Lama is respected, but not guaranteed forever, by the younger and more radical elements of the Tibetan movement, which have only temporarily renounced the use of violence to achieve their political goals.

both Beijing and the Dalai Lama -- and by extension his mainstream followers -- understand how little time they have and how, without a resolution, the uncertainties surrounding the Tibet issue could become permanent after the spiritual leader's death.

Of course, many uncertainties surround the return of the Dalai Lama; it is even uncertain whether it could happen at all. Indeed, overcoming 55 years of hostile relations takes enormous effort, and even if the Dalai Lama is allowed to return to Tibet, it is only one of several steps in much broader negotiations between Beijing and the Tibetan exile community over how to reach a resolution, including the possible resettlement of 200,000 Tibetans in exile, the status of the government-in-exile, the authority of the

Director was asking Vestards constantly in the process of shooting: Where are you going next; what is important to you; where will you play? ‘It was impossible to foresee anything this time. I had to know his program! I remember, Vestards once told me that he is to have a very important concert in Berlin, on which a lot would depend.’ So, me and our cinematographer AivarsKalniņš, to whom I owe all the greatest compliments and gratitude, set on a trail of our protagonist through the main cities in Europe he had to play in.

Bilbao, Berlin, Barcelona, London… If you have eyes and interest and you are alert to your surroundings, every place will offer you a wonderful story of its own. For example, waiting in the airport ticket-line, Vestards would start to play on an invisible instrument…

Working of this film, Rūta was able to visit nearly all the cities in Europe where Vestards has played; well, Shanghai had to be omitted. ‘He wanted us to go there very much; unfortunately, it was too expensive a trip. And nobody was able to help financially, which is why I understood – I had to establish my own studio, for my previous one, where I made ‘The Darling of Fate’ told me I couldn’t hope for the money for Vestards’ film earlier than in two years. I am not old enough yet to wait for two years for my turn!’ – Rūta reveals a nuance, in our dialogue, which made her establish her own studio RUUK.

Liszt’s storm and the land of childhood

‘There are so many episodes in the film I would wish to talk about! The one about Vestards’ love for his sister Aurelia… About how much forest means to him – as it does for me, as, being a gamekeeper’s daughter, I have grown up in the forest myself. So, his feelings are so close to me,’ Rūta Celma reveals, mentioning some of the filming places – such as the wonderful medieval castle outside Barcelona where Vestards played already more than once, on the way. ‘We saw what a real tempest is like there, a real rain fall and palms getting broken… Our cameraman had to wade the water with his camera on the shoulder afterwards, and I still asked him to photograph, and some of these

Certainly Gates' summary of the MRAP saga in his book skips over the bureaucratic process that had ground on for years before he arrived late in 2006. Gayl and others had, in fact, pushed for the production of hundreds of MRAPs in use in Iraq.

Just as certain, Gates couldn't be expected to know about every vehicle program in the sprawling military portfolio. He'd been on the job less than half a year when his military adviser at the time, Lt. Gen. Peter Chiarelli, called his attention to our story about the success that Marines in Anbar province had been having with MRAPs.

Did I mention that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were going badly, too? Gates had a lot on his plate.

Gates notes his book - as we have time and time again - that our story prompted him to push for more MRAPs. There's no reason to doubt that's true. And it's just as true that those MRAPs wouldn't have been in Iraq if it hadn't been for Gayl, et al, pushing for the early shipments.

What the MRAP program needed to evolve from a niche truck for troops clearing roads to the workhorse for carrying them to war was a high-profile kick in the pants from somebody like Gates.

Walk near his old office today, and you'll see Gates' official portrait. In it, Gates leans against his desk. A model of an MRAP rests on top.

Gayl's on much firmer footing in writing that nobody at a high level was held to account for delays in fielding the trucks. His Marine Corps superiors sat on an urgent need request in 2005 resulting in delays that cost countless lives. The Army, too, knew about the Humvee's vulnerability to IEDs since at least the early 1990s.

Those who blew the whistle on delays, Gayl writes, watched as their "careers, including mine, were subsequently destroyed by Marine Corps leaders at Gates' Pentagon."

Gates was "duty-bound to get to the bottom of the MRAP delay and ensure accountability to prevent 'business as usual' practices, while protecting those who challenge them. He did neither," Gayl writes.

In Duty, Gates writes that the "villains were the largely nameless and faceless people - and their leaders - who were wed to their old plans, programs and thinking and refused to change their ways

Over 100 people remain trapped in New Bern, a town on the Neuse River which has been hit hard by rain and flooding. "Nobody expected this," a rescued resident, Tom Ballance, told The Weather Channel. "We were fools."

An emergency curfew remains in place in New Bern as rescuers continue to try and access trapped people.

The storm was giant when it made landfall: hurricane-force winds extended outward up to 80 miles, and tropical-storm-force winds extended nearly 200 miles from the storm's center.

Shayanne Gal/Business Insider

"Landfall of a hurricane is never the end of the event," Weather Channel meteorologist and hurricane expert Rick Knabb said on Friday. "Slow-moving Florence is not even close to being done with the coast."

Footage from North Carolina shows massive flooding and high winds

These images, recorded by a camera maintained by the HurricaneTracker.com website in New Bern, North Carolina, showed the dramatic progress of flooding on Thursday and Friday.

Other photos and videos shared on social media also showed dangerous conditions in North Carolina.

Although Florence's wind speed means it is now a tropical storm, the NHC has consistently warned that the storm is no less dangerous because the wind speed is lower. The biggest threats come from the rain and floods.

Onto the good stuff: the glasses receive IR light pulses timed with the movie to black out the appropriate eye with the appropriate frame and producing a 3D effect. With the use of IR Investigator the team grabbed said timings; it was then simply a matter of building their own IR projector, and bringing it back to the theater to annoy the crowd setting it up for their 3D home cinema.

This is not how a lot of 3d theaters work. The ones I’ve been in use polarized lenses, and two polarized images on the screen at once so each eye only sees the image it’s supposed to. There are theaters giving out 3d shutter glasses? That’s awesome.

If I paid for my family of four to see Avatar, costing at least $50 for tix alone, and some punk wants to screw with our day out, he’s gonna have a problem. Changing the TV at the bar is one thing, wasting my money is another.

anon says “I read this site everyday and here people whinning about how “thats obnoxious” or your a jerk or many others….get over it the whole point of this site is to be creative i say have fun with what you create unless it does physical harm to someone”

How about I come to your house and cut the electricity, phone, and water off for a laugh. To make it creative, I’ll do it with an autonomous robot. Nobody is physically harmed, so I trust you’ll take it in good humor.

Yea, this is pretty weak. There would seem to be a lot of holes with this technique anyway.

Also, avatar (and many movies like it) use polarized glasses the two lenses where one is polarized for the vertical and one for the horizontal. The light going out onto the screen is also polarized such that there will essentially two images displayed on the screen where one image gets blocked out for each eye.

@David S: They’re not horizontally and vertically polarised, they use circular polarisers.

You can test this by wearing a pair of glasses and looking at another pair (both facing same direction) and rotating the

Guitar Guy

» The éminence grise of boardwalk performers is inline-skate-dancing, electric-guitar-playing Harry Perry. Thirty-six years after he first hit the beach, the practicing Sikh is still waiting for his big rock and roll break. Why? “To be a great guitarist you need to play in excess of eight, ten hours a day.” Fantasy: For Live Nation to put out his record and book him on tour. “When I was onstage in Wisconsin once and 30,000 people were cheering, I felt the g-force. I want that.” Peanut gallery: “People in Venice take my picture. In West Hollywood they’re more into the music.”

The Walker

» For 30 years drivers passing the Silver Lake Reservoir have seen a bare-chested pedestrian, face buried in a newspaper, oblivious to all but the fine print before him. Long walks are a routine from childhood that continued after Marc Abrams set up a medical practice in the San Fernando Valley. Although he’s now retired, he still makes daily 20-mile treks. Why? “I get fresh air, exercise, and sun.” Media diet: “I read the New York Times, L.A. Times, Wall Street Journal, Daily News, and USA Today. Plus about 20 magazines a month, mostly about history and classical music.” Peanut gallery: “Sometimes people say, ‘You must walk because you have a heart condition.’ If I had a heart condition, I’d be dead.”

Hula Hoop Lady

» Jean Hooper, whose name coincidentally matches her favorite pastime, isn’t shy about her regimen: twirling for up to two hours several days a week outside her condominium on busy Venice Boulevard. If she isn’t waving to motorists, it’s because she’s too caught up in the show tunes playing on her headphones. Hooper brought hula hoops (even the ancient Greeks loved them) into fitness classes at L.A. schools nine years ago, then kept on hooping after she returned to work as a hairstylist. Secret weapon: “I use a Wave Hoop by Maui Toys. It’s got water in it. Those Wham-O hoops with air in them? I am not able to do those at all.” Peanut gallery: “I get gifts—pieces of fruit, a calendar, a

“That went up like a scuba-diver’s fart.” If anyone knows the meaning of this expression or when one would use it, please let me know. We ate supper together with other travelers at our hostel in Bariloche every night and one night Tys, a Danish guy who looks like Nick Carter (from the Backstreet Boys), was reading Latin American Spanish sayings and phrases from this book he had with him. Most of them were quite funny and made sense but we couldn’t figure out this one about the scuba-diver. Would the fart go up fast? Or slow? Or unnoticed? Or not go up at all?

We had such an awesome time at Moving Travel Bar Hostel that we ended up staying there for 4 nights and not 2 like we originally planned. Julia (pronounced Gulia), the hostel’s owner, is very friendly and helpful. She also makes yummy supper every night and bakes bread so that her guests have fresh bread for breakfast! Her hostel is very clean, in a good location and wifi is fast and free. She made us a ma-te to taste. (It is spelt M-A-T-E, but you say ma-te and not mate as in good day, mate.) Mate is a caffeinated herbal tea which is very popular in Argentina. There is an art to making it and a social and ritual way to drink it. The tea is drunk through a straw with a filter and is usually shared. To me it tasted what I imagine tobacco in boiled water would taste like. I preferred it with some sugar but I’m not the biggest fan of mate quite yet.

Marc, Tina and I had a fun time in town yesterday after siesta. We visited Bariloche’s Cathedral and went to a local panaderia (bakery). You have to pay if you want a photo with the gorgeous St.Bernard dogs which the owners walk around town with, but Tina managed to distract the guy so that I could play with the one puppy a bit and Marc took a quick, sneaky shot. After supper we went beer tasting at Mushka, a place recommended by Julia, and had conversations about life and death and that you should not be too hard on yourself. On our way back to the hostel a cute “el perro” (dog) walked us home.

Here we are, on a bus again, this time on our way

The Harlem Globetrotters Tickets:

The Harlem Globetrotters is a unique American basketball team that plays only exhibition games. The team combines athleticism, theatre and comedy into its performances. Abe Seperstein founded it in 1926 in Chicago, Illinois, as the Savoy Big Five. The team officially changed its name to The Harlem New York Globetrotters in 1927. Throughout the years the members of the team numbered over 520 players and they have played more than 20,000 exhibition games in 118 countries. The executive offices are currently in Phoenix, Arizona, and the team is owned by Shamrock Holdings.

The first star of the team was Albert Runt Pullins, who was an incredible dribbler and shooter. Soon Inman Jackson, who played center and had a very good sense of attractive performances and comedy, supported him. Together they marked the two main roles in the team - the showman and the dribbler.

During the first years The Harlem Globetrotters was a serious team that struggled in the World Professional Basketball Tournament. The team started with the exhibition matches in 1950. In 1977 Globetrotters celebrated the 50th season.

After years of hard work, in 1982 Globetrotters became the first sports team honored with a star on Hollywood's famous Walk of Fame.

In 1985 the team signed the first ever-female player - the Olympic Gold Medalist Lynette Woodard. In 2004 she was inducted into Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

In 1994 Columbia Pictures produced a feature film focused on the team's early years. Throughout the years the players often were stars in films and TV shows.

In 1997 Magic Johnson signed with The Harlem Globetrotters and it was a real feast for the true fens of the team.

The team has set many records. In 2000 Michael Wild Thing Wilson set Guinness World Record with 12-hoop dunk. In 2009 Scooter Christensen set two Guinness World Records for ball spinning at NBA All-Star Weekend.

In 2010 the team Harlem Globetrotters celebrated its 85th anniversary.

Health and Eucharist

Alex Tang gives a review on Joseph Prince's book, Health and Wholeness through the Holy Communion (Singapore: Media, 2006). One of the points highlighted is that “The Holy Communion is God’s solution to offset the decay (ageing). And even your friends will see the results. They will ask you, “Hey, why do you seem to look younger and younger? You never seem to age!”” (p.58).

Hmmm....any truth? Well....since coming to STM, I have been having Holy Communion more frequently now - twice a week in the seminary chapel. Could this be the result that when I went to see the doctor last week, he was shocked to find out that I am a lecturer and not a first year student? (BTW - it happened again earlier today when I took my mother to see her doctor. The doctor asked, "Are you a student?")

What is happening to the church in Singapore and Malaysia? If you want to stay young, you now have a choice: take frequent Holy Communion, or let your pastor touch your body parts and pray for you! Pick your choice....

One of my customer, who is working in the bookshop at Joseph Prince's church, said that the book is very good and she bought a few as gifts to friends... When i heard that, i tried hard to not rolled my eyeballs.

After the hiccups with this year's application, i dont think i would want to do my theological studies in an evangelical seminary at this moment. I need too much space to breathe, space where some evangelicals, sometimes, consider over the borders. If you know what i mean :)

Not too sure what u mean by "evangelical sometimes, consider over the borders" that discourage you to study at evangelical seminary at the moment?? Please enlighten. Sounded like u may consider pentecostal seminary, liberal seminary, or Roman Catholic seminaries??!!!

“I’ve never seen one like that before,” said Boychuk, whose 13th power-play goal of the year gave him sole possession of the league lead and set a new franchise record for most in a single season. “I don’t think anyone knew where it was. The goalie didn’t. I kind of saw it go in and I was kind of surprised.

“I’ve had some crazy ones go in off my butt, off my head and off my leg, but that one was just a little floater that nobody saw. It was a lucky one.”

The goal was Boychuk’s eighth in his last 10 games, a stretch that includes two hat tricks.

“He’s always been a guy that if you give him the puck around the net there’s a good chance he’s going to score,” said Daniels. “Right now his came is a lot more consistent than in the past and it’s showing not only when he’s been here but up in Carolina they’ve been really happy with him. He’s been bringing it every day.”

Dolan, who replaced the injured Brody Sutter on a line with Terry and Justin Shugg, had hit a goal post prior to beating Thiessen for the eventual game-winning goal just prior to the five-minute mark of the third period. He also set up Terry for a breakaway chance late in the third as the Checkers peppered Thiessen, who bounced back after Boychuk’s soft goal, with several chances to put the game away before Norfolk got to within one.

Dolan, who had taken his usual spot on the fourth line since returning from a prolonged injury on Feb. 7, had found out he would be playing on his new line just prior to the game.

“It’s definitely a different game playing with Chris and Justin because they’re two very skilled players,” said Dolan. “It’s fun to get that opportunity and I’m glad we made the most of it.”

Daniels said that Brody Sutter, who took Tuesday’s morning skate as usual, was day-to-day and would be fine to play the team’s next game in Texas this Friday.

The upcoming two-game set against the Stars and the eight following it will be a tough test for the Checkers, who are now back to the .500 mark at 24

The Psychological Shortcoming That Can Help Explain Why We’re Arresting Innocent Moms

Generally speaking, when you're trying to understand a news event through a behavioral-science lens, it's not a good idea to roll up, loudly invoke some psychological buzzword, and then drop the mike as though your work is done. People are complicated, and their actions can rarely be boiled down to any one mechanism. But still, as I've read Jonathan Chait's and Radley Balko's recent articles about parents being arrested for letting their kids play outside without supervision, one such buzzword has repeatedly popped into my head: the fundamental attribution error.

Advertisement

To review the case Chait highlighted: Debra Harrell of North Augusta, South Carolina, had been bringing her daughter to her (the mom's) job at McDonald's every day, where she would sit with her laptop. After the family's house was robbed and the laptop stolen, the girl asked to be dropped off at a playground for the day. Another parent called police, and Harrell was arrested for unlawful conduct toward a child.

So what is the fundamental attribution error, and how does it apply here? It's simply the tendency to believe people's actions are driven by some fundamental aspect of their character rather than situational factors. In this case, as Chait rightly points out, it's clear this mom didn't have a lot of other options with regard to child care, and she figured her daughter would be safe at what is apparently a well-populated park. In short, it appears she had a pretty good reason to leave her daughter there while she was at work (especially because, despite widespread hysteria over strangers snatching children randomly, such cases are exceedingly rare).

The fundamental attribution error screams otherwise: No, this is a terrible mom! She is a bad, neglectful person, because a good mom wouldn't have left her kid alone for hours. That can explain some of the angry response to this, and the fact that she and other parents in difficult situations are facing what certainly appear to be trumped-up charges.

Not everyone gets battered by other people's fundamental attribution errors, though, and that's where things get tricky and class- and race-driven. Suffice it to say parents in suburban neighborhoods like the one in which I grow up, where I was wandering about well before Harrell's daughter was, don't get tossed in jail for

Berthet said that by not excluding eminent domain at the outset, the Port will likely receive design submissions that require the seizure of property.

"The words 'minimize' and 'where possible' are infinitely permissive and means there will be some [need for eminent domain]," Berthet said. "The rules should have read 'utilizes only currently-owned Port Authority real estate,' "

Other large-scale developments in the city, like Pacific Park (formerly known as Atlantic Yards), have had to go through eminent domain. The process typically generates public opposition, prolongs the construction time frame, and, in the case of the bus terminal, will likely add hundreds of millions of dollars of costs to the project. The Port will have to spend that money to compensate owners in order to seize properties.

"You're talking about Manhattan real estate. It's very valuable and it's going to be serious money to take it through eminent domain,” said Micheal Rikon, an attorney with GoldsteinRikonRikon & Houghton, a law firm that specializes in condemnation cases. "People just don't like losing their property. If it's something that is challenged in court, it could add two years to the project."

The five concepts released by the Port that the design competition is expected to build upon would each involve knocking down private properties, including a dozen or so residential and retail building, along with a church, on the west side of Ninth Avenue between West 39th and West 40th streets. Other iterations would include razing the buildings on the same block-front on the east side of the avenue and possibly a collection of properties on the northwest corner of West 40th Street and Ninth Avenue.

"It's not about legal action; we plan to take political action," said Joe Restuccia, the executive director of the Clinton Housing Development Co., a landlord that owns an apartment building at 541 Ninth Ave., which has affordable housing and long-time retail tenants. The property could be seized as part of an eminent domain action by the Port.

"Our neighborhood was able to beat a football stadium," Restuccia said, referring to an ultimately unsuccessful Bloomberg-era plan to build a stadium for the Jets over the Hudson rail yards.

Plans to build a new bus terminal were accelerated last week when Degnan reached a deal with other Port Authority board commissioners to include the project in the agency's nearly $30 billion capital plan.



Corruption, incompetence charges plague new Afghan police force

In the early days of the operation, the Marines temporarily sidelined an entire ANCOP battalion after one-quarter of the 179 police officers tested positive for drug use

By Dion Nissenbaum

Although the members of Afghanistan's elite new police force have been touted as the country's best and brightest, U.S. military strategists find that they're plagued by the same problems as Afghanistan's conventional police, who are widely considered corrupt, ineffective and inept.

Like the discredited police officers they were supposed to supplant, ANCOP members set up checkpoints designed to do little more than shake down Afghans, according to U.S. officials briefed on the RAND Corp. analysis.

Nevertheless, U.S. and Afghan government strategists are counting on the new Afghan National Civil Order Police to play a central role in an operation this summer to seize full control of Kandahar, the Taliban's spiritual capital in southern Afghanistan.

In the weeks since they were sent to Helmand province as part of the U.S.-led offensive in Marjah, ANCOP members have set up checkpoints to shake down residents, been kicked out for using drugs and shunned in some areas as outsiders, according to U.S. officials briefed on a recent analysis by the RAND Corp.

More than a quarter of the officers in one ANCOP battalion in Helmand were dismissed for drug use, and the rest were sent off for urgent retraining. One Western official who attended the briefing termed ANCOP's role in Marjah a disaster. The official spoke only on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.

"ANCOP is not necessarily the answer to the maiden's prayer when it comes to security," said Canadian Brig. Gen. Craig King, the Kandahar-based director of future plans for international forces in Afghanistan. "They're just like any other unit here that you have to ensure their conduct is professional."

Western leaders have been counting on ANCOP forces as trailblazers in the effort to establish a trusted police force. The performance of Afghan security forces is likely to be a topic of discussion this week when Afghan President Hamid Karzai meets President Barack Obama in Washington.

Last week, the head of NATO's police training mission in Afghanistan hailed ANCOP at a Kabul graduation ceremony for the first class in a new officer

It also has worked to cement its place in the international community, signing on to pacts such as the World Trade Organisation, and occasionally taking the lead in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).

Ready to spend

Vietnam observers like to say communists might have won the war, but today capitalists are declaring victory. Since Vietnam made the switch to a mostly market economy in the 1980s, it has become not only a top exporter of rice and coffee, but also a manufacturing powerhouse.

The trade boom created jobs for Vietnamese, who have spent years stashing away their earnings. According to World Bank figures, Vietnam's per capita income rose to $1,550 in 2012 from $1,000 in 2008.

Now, as consumption growth catches up with trade growth, Vietnamese are ready to spend.

"Those people who got jobs with factories making shoes 15 years ago, they're 15 years older, they're making more money, they have higher skills, higher wages, and so on," said Herb Cochran, director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam.

Some say these higher incomes mean the time is now for foreign businesses to target Vietnamese consumers.

With a population of 90 million, Vietnam has the fastest-growing middle and affluent class in Southeast Asia, according to the Boston Consulting Group. The consultancy estimated there would be 33 million people in this class in 2020, compared with 12 million in 2012.

This is the "sweet spot" in the Vietnamese market, as US Ambassador to Vietnam David Shear said at the McDonald's ribbon-cutting.

Increasing wealth

As increasingly wealthy Vietnamese middle classes decide where to lighten their wallets, they are looking to US companies such as McDonald's. On opening day here in Ho Chi Minh City, some 20,000 customers poured in to order Happy Meals, snap photos with Ronald McDonald, and use the country's first motorbike drive-thru.

It's not surprising that consumers would take to the chain. On the heels of Britney Spears, Coca-Cola, and the iPhone, McDonald's is seen as the latest sign of the embrace of American capitalism.

In explaining the enthusiasm, a professor who teaches American culture here in the city points to the post-war diaspora; the 2010 US census reported more than 1

First Malware ‘Thanatos Ransomware’ Demands Ransom in Bitcoin Cash

A new strain of ransomware attack named Thanatos Ransomware accepts ransom money in Bitcoin cash. Although, it contains a decryption bug which makes it quite impossible for the victimized users to recover the encoded files even after paying asked ransom fee. According to the latest research report published by a reputed online security firm, once Thanatos Ransomware invades the targeted Windows computers, it injects a key for each and every enciphered files. However, those keys were never saved anywhere. As a result, the restoration of encrypted system files are nearly impossible.

Cyber extortionists behind Thanatos Ransomware threats the victims by stating that encoded files can only be decoded by the decryption tool provided by them. Unfortunately, it is important for you to understand that the decryption tool which claims to decode the encrypted PC files won’t help you in decoding the files. Therefore, cyber security experts highly advised the victimized computers not to pay the asked ransom money because the threat actors behind Thanatos Ransomware cannot be trusted. Even after paying the ransom fee asked by the operators of this ransomware, the compromised Windows users were left empty-handed.

According to the malware researchers, Thanatos Ransomware is the first ransom-demanding virus which accepts ransom money in the form of Bitcoin cash. Luckily, the good news is that it may be possible to brutally force the encryption key for each encoded files. Talking about the encryption method of this ransomware which is completely a mess and does not introduce something new in the world of malicious cyber parasites. Meanwhile, Bitcoin cash is considered as a new cryptocurrency which was spun off from the Bitcoin. This is the first time that criminal hackers are accepting the Bitcoin cash and in this case, operators of Thanatos Ransomware also accepts Etherum in the form of ransom payment.

Technically speaking, after encoding the specific file types stored on the victim’s system, the Thanatos Ransomware appends the enciphered file name with ‘.THANATOS’ extension. Right after the successful completion of file encryption procedure, malware connects the affected device with a specific URL identified as ‘iplogger[.]com/1t3i37’ to keep track of the amount of infected systems. Furthermore, Thanatos Ransomware will generate an autorun key reported as ‘Microsoft Update System Web-Helper‘ which opens the ransom note

1. He Has Been a Partnered Streamer Since 2011

Though Ninja may now be known mostly for his successful Twitch streaming, that was not always the case. Before 2011, he was playing games competitively. According to a Forbes interview, Ninja has been making over $100 a day streaming since 2011.

Now, the Twitch Partner Program is a little different than it was then. Currently, the requirements to become a partnered Twitch streamer include streaming to an established and steadily growing audience at least 3 times a week. In the “Road to Partner” on Twitch, it states that, in order to get partnered, a streamer must have an average of at least 75 concurrent viewers.

Though Ninja has been partnered since 2011, his stream has become more popular recently. Due to a number of factors including a relatively recent switch in games and overall community building skills, Ninja is becoming one of the most popular streamers on Twitch. His channel is currently the 10th most-followed channel on Twitch.

2. Ninja Was a Professional Halo Player

Until recently, Ninja was a professional Halo player. He announcedon August 13, 2017 that he would not compete in the fall season of the Halo Championship Series Pro League, citing his recent marriage, exploring his career in streaming and dedicating himself to PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds.

Prior to the announcement, Ninja had been competing in Halo tournaments for nearly a decade. He began his professional gaming career when he attended the MLG Orlando 2009 as a member of Four of a Kind. He went on to place in multiple tournaments as a member of different groups. His career began to thrive when he began playing Halo: Reach competitively. When Halo: 4 reached the professional scene, Ninja saw his first win. At the end of 2012, Ninja took 1st place at The Halo 4 exhibition as a member of Warriors. He continued to compete in Halo 4 tournaments through 2013. Ninja’s most recent tournament was in 2016, where his team placed 4th in the X Games Aspen 2016 in a Halo 5 tournament.

In late 2017, Ninja switched from playing H1Z1 and PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds to playing the popular battle-royale game Fortnite. The streamer has quickly become known as one of the best Fortnite players. The game is free-to-play and has reached peak popularity in recent weeks. On February

Whether it's a 'War on Christmas' or just progressivism run amok, the song 'Baby It's Cold Outside' has been firmly in the crosshairs this holiday season. Here are just a few of the headlines making the rounds:

The left might think they are woke and on the right side of history in the wake of the #MeToo movement — but how shocked do you think they'd be if they knew Glenn beat them to the punch over a decade ago? Don't believe me? Take a listen to this clip from our audio vault from 2008.

Christmas has arrived early for mainstream media. They have their first sentencing of a major player in President Trump's inner circle. Yesterday, Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen was sentenced by a federal judge in Manhattan. How did it come to this and how did Cohen explain himself to the judge? We start there next…

President Trump's former attorney, 52-year-old Michael Cohen, is going to jail. Well, it will probably be one of those federal prison camps with a dorm that's more like a college campus. But he's going to be locked up. A federal judge sentenced him to three years in prison for financial crimes, and two months for lying to Congress. He also ordered Cohen to pay $2 million in financial penalties. The judge called Cohen's misdeeds a "veritable smorgasbord of criminal conduct."

As a lawyer, Mr. Cohen should have known better. While Mr. Cohen is taking steps to mitigate his criminal conduct by pleading guilty and volunteering useful information to prosecutors, that does not wipe the slate clean.

Cohen pled guilty in August to eight criminal charges in two different cases. One brought by special counsel Robert Muller for Cohen's lying to Congress about a potential Trump Tower project in Moscow. The second was for bank-fraud, tax, and campaign finance violations brought by federal prosecutors in New York.

President Trump said recently that Cohen has simply been lying to get a reduced sentence for crimes that have nothing to do with him. Cohen was very emotional as he apologized to the judge, saying:

It was my own weakness and a blind loyalty to this man that led me to choose a path of darkness over light. Time and time again I felt it was my duty to cover up his dirty deeds rather than to listen to my own inner voice and my moral compass.

The left thinks that Cohen's sentencing marks the beginning of the end for

Criminal Justice Education in New Hampshire

There are 10 schools in New Hampshire that offer criminal justice degree programs. Some of these are two-year associates programs; others are four-year bachelor's programs in criminal justice educaiton. A couple of schools also offer masters programs with an emphasis on online studies. This allows those already pursuing criminal justice careers to seek advancement while maintaining their current positions. Masters degrees often open doors to management and administrative positions in law enforcement, probation and parole, forensics, and criminal investigations.

Students enrolling in a four-year degree program will take basic required courses in math, English and science. In addition to the core curriculum, some electives can be taken, especially in years two and three. A variety of criminal justice courses will round out a student's coursework. Such courses will often be similar to those listed here:

Basics of Criminal Law

Criminal Justice Research Methods

U.S. Courts and Legal System

Ethics Studies in Criminal Justice

American Racial Relations

Conducting Legal Research

In addition to the coursework, a semester out in the field will usually occur during one's Junior year. The fourth and final year in criminal justice education will usually consist mostly of an off-site internship related to the student's selected criminal justice specialty.

If you are concerned about paying for school, you may want to visit this page to learn more about criminal justice scholarships.

Also, The New Hampshire Incentive Program, the Leveraged Incentive Grants and the Granite State Scholars are just three financial aid programs worth looking into. If you need funding for your criminal justice education, it's also worth consulting your future college and university counselors for school-specific scholarships.

Outlook for Criminal Justice in New Hampshire

Criminal justice degrees are especially valuable in the fields of protective services and legal aid, two fields in which the Bureau of Labor Statistics anticipated an 11 percent growth from 2010 to 2020. According to data compiled in May 2012 by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), law enforcement officers in New Hampshire are paid an average annual salary of about $49,450. The national average is $55,010. Detectives and criminal investigators earn an average of $69,360 in New Hampshire. Correctional officers receive an average of $40,130 on an annual basis. Supervisory personnel earn a significant amount more. For example, first-

The Beauty in the Two-Week Notice

Even if your boss wasn’t the most gracious in giving deadlines, your ample notice of resignation will be a gift to your coworkers who’ll likely have to shoulder the load in your absence if a replacement isn’t found before your departure. Remember, there is no “I” in team.

Established a good rapport with those you’ve shared a parking deck with during your stint at your company? They’ll likely want to celebrate your new beginnings. A last hurrah after work is a networking opportunity in disguise, as many of your coworkers will likely want to keep in touch with you (added bonus – LinkedIn buddies!).

Giving two-weeks’ notice graciously can also allot time to speak with HR to find out about things like: payouts for unused vacation days, COBRA benefits to bridge your coverage if there is a lag in the time for open enrollment at your new gig, and implementing your suggestions for improvement via the exit interview.

Training the new “You”

Now that you’ve submitted your notice to separate (in writing), use this as an opportunity to add to your repertoire and resume!

You may not realize how much you contributed to your organization until you’ve created the training agenda for the new “you.” Listing all of your responsibilities not only validates your capabilities (GO YOU!), it can also be used as leverage for a counteroffer at your new employer or a great incentive to update your resume. Another plus – this list may highlight areas where there are gaps in your skillset that you can, ideally, develop in your new gig.

You are the expert when it comes to your role so be sure to impart this knowledge to the person replacing you. Remember all of those times you wanted to bang your head into your desk from frustration? Be generous in doling out the metaphorical Excedrin by providing thorough training to your proxy.

Perks of professionalism

Who doesn’t love having proof of how fantastic they are? Good news! Your willingness to work out your two-week notice and train your replacement, just might move your former boss to pen you a letter of recommendation that will last throughout the ages.

ASK for a letter of recommendation as you are closing up shop if your boss hasn’t mentioned it – chances are they will be happy to write one for you!

Saving $9 billion on FRS in fiscal year 2043-44 is about what it will cost to put a dike around Miami – if it’s not already underwater by then.

When financial decisions are made based on political reasons, financial disasters are in Florida’s future.

Private sector employees had their pension funds stolen by company owners. Now the Republicans want to allow the Corporate Raiders to steal your taxpayer funded FRS.

I’m an overly emotional person. I won’t lie. I get bothered by most things around me, from loud chatter in the pub, to a total stranger relating some sad news to me, or even bright lights.

Yes – bright lights.

Most days, I simply cannot cope with the way external stimuli affects my nervous system. I feel overwhelmed most of the time, and each day is exhausting.

Perhaps the worst thing is that no one even seems to understand where I’m coming from and what I’m feeling.

“Stop being so emotional,” I’m told. “Snap out of it!”

It’s impossible to just snap out of it.

I’m sure you know what I mean. And as you know, being overly emotional is not some sort of personality flaw that can be altered. It’s an innate trait. It’s down to our chemicals and the way we’re wired. Can we just change all of that? Hardly likely. I struggle with to make toast without burning it, so I can’t imagine myself re-wiring my own brain!!

However, there are at least ways you and I can cope better if we are too overly emotional. Here are ten tips:

Get Into A Morning And Bedtime Routine

Overly emotional people get stressed really quickly when they lose control. Unpredictability is not a good thing to us, and we need some stability. And it’s for this reason that I suggest you get into some sort of morning and bedtime routine.

Morning routines are filled with cues that guide where you’re going next, as well as how you’re feeling. For example, I always listen to a certain song in the morning. It makes me feel good, gets me motivated, and reminds me that I need to seize the day. It puts me in the right frame of mind and prepares me for work.

All successful people have morning routines. It gives them stability, helps get them organised, and prepares them for the day ahead in the right way.

Stop Looking For A Solution

As mentioned, being an emotional person is not a personality flaw. It cannot just be fixed. It’s more of an innate temperament trait. As such, my advice to you is to stop looking for a solution from without, and to start harmonising with what’s inside you. Accept that you are who are you

Summer colds are the absolute worst. We’ve all been battling various versions of crud for the past week and a half – everything from pink eye to the common cold. The kids have started giving sympathy coughs, I swear. We’re all somewhat of a mess, but I think we’re on the mend.

The girls didn’t have school last Thursday afternoon and so I was on PTO and home with them. Between the 4th of July being in the middle of the week and their school being closed mid-week (for what dumb reason I’m still unclear on…), I’m feeling all sorts of off. This week looks to be back to the grind and a typical week, but…we’ll see. I’m starting with a weekly menu which is more than I can say for last week.

I had my sights set on a Sunday Fun Day with the family, but of course there were some hiccups there. I must have snored Mark out of the bedroom because he wasn’t in bed with me when I awoke to Piper reading to herself in her crib. I got up with the girls and quickly planned a menu for the week and made out a grocery list.

The girls and I headed to Aldi only to find out it doesn’t open until 9am. It was 8:30am. UGH. Off to Meijer we went. As I stepped on the edge of the door jamb to reach over the massive car seat to retrieve the toy Piper wanted to take into the car, my foot slipped (wet shoes) and my shin SLAMMED into the car with the entire weight of my body. It took my breath away and I was near tears, trying to keep in every four letter word as the kids looked at me in complete disorientation as to what to do. I needed a few moments to let the pain subside and off we went. (I have a blue and BULGING tender spot right on top of my shin – still SO painful).

When we arrived home we made the split decision to ditch church in lieu of blueberry picking. We hadn’t even gotten into the field before Shea had stepped into a pile of loose dirt and completely flipped out, ripping off her shoe and demanding her foot to be cleaned (thank God for wet wipes) and Piper fell face-first into a muddy pit created by tractor wheels.

Wei Dong of Hoboken makes the best of his selection with a sprawling, fantastical painting filled with an abundance of Chinese figures -- performers, workers, soldiers, mandarins and Communist Party officials interspersed with seminaked women and, yes, goats. Titled ''They Can Do Anything'' (2004), it reads like a satire of Cultural Revolution-era propaganda paintings espousing Chinese superiority. But, then again, the title and overall friskiness might also be a reference to official corruption in China.

Mr. Dong has a firm command of both Western and Chinese painting techniques -- his sense of perspective and figure drawing are near flawless. But he is also mining a now-popular vein in contemporary Chinese art, with a handful of artists producing the same kind of bawdy, quasi-historical tableaux. That's O.K , if all he is interested in is producing liquid assets (these paintings tend to sell well); but if not, the challenge for him now will be to find a way to anchor his imagery in the present.

Another attraction is the Jersey City painter Aaron Yassin's ''Pyramid of the Mind'' (2003), a colossal, kaleidoscopic pattern painting of digitally manipulated and combined photographs of the Brooklyn Bridge, the John Hancock Tower in Boston and an ordinary municipal water tower. Beautiful and serene, it toys playfully with ideas of perceptual space in ways that suggest all kinds of fabulous possibilities.

Doodlelike drawings are also in abundance here, as expected, given that they are so prevalent in the art world today. Jeffrey Gibson paints and pours acrylic paint and tinted silicon onto the walls to create three-dimensional, Day-Glo, graffitilike drawings, while Lisette Morel, also scuffing up the architecture, presents a messy pencil wall drawing. Both artworks are fun and executed with exquisite finesse.

John Jodzio, a Hoboken artist and another convert to the cult of doodle drawing, offers an amusing, cartoonlike depiction of Jersey City as a crossroads of ethnic communities. In addition to recognizable storefronts and diners are reconfigured landmarks, sombrero-wearing cactuses, a bullfight ring, cowboys and Indians, weird cat people and gangs of gun-toting thrill seekers fighting and holding up liquor stores for cash. It's a wild, giddy portrait of Jersey City life.

Repeated subcutaneous injection of NaHS not only enhanced streptozotocin-induced hyperalgesia, but also increased intraepidermal fiber loss in diabetic rats. Contrariwise, daily injection of hydroxylamine prevented the diabetes-induced intraepidermal nerve fiber loss. Results seem to indicate that H2S directly or indirectly activates TRP channels, which in turn, increase intracellular calcium inducing hyperalgesia and subsequent nerve fiber loss. Our results are in line with previous studies that point out that the loss of intraepidermal nerve fibers play a critical role in the development of various neuropathies, including diabetes [57, 58].

In summary, our results suggest that H2S, synthetized by the CBS enzyme, activates/sensitizes peripheral TRPV1, TRPA1 and TRPC channels in non-peptidergic fibers to contribute to the streptozotocin-induced hyperalgesia and peripheral nerve fiber loss. In addition, data suggest that CBS, TRPA1, TRPV1 and TRPC channels could be potential targets for the treatment of peripheral neuropathy associated with diabetes.

Adult female Wistar rats weighing between 200 and 220 g were used in all experiments. Female rats were used based on the fact that there are no differences in formalin test between female and male rats in our conditions (Additional file 1: Figure S1). Animals were maintained in an air-conditioned room at 23–25 °C on a 12-h light/dark cycle, with ad libitum access to food and water and they were obtained from our own breeding facilities. All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals and their suffering.

Resources for Kids!

To all our parishioners with young children,

I wanted to take a moment today to thank you for being a part of our parish and for teaching your children how to live our faith, either at home or through our local religious education classes. I also want to acknowledge that communication from me to all of you and your families is overdue, and I hope you will forgive me for taking so long to reach out to you.

I know that the Coronavirus has not hit our area very hard, but the economic challenges certainly have. If any of you are struggling right now, I want to assure you of my prayers and support. Please do not hesitate to call our parishes if there is anything I can do to help support you through these challenges. Our parish phone number is 360-425-4660.

It might seem surprising, but moments like the one we are currently in can strengthen our faith a great deal. A lot of people are stressed out due to rapid change and uncertainty, but this is not the first time in history that humanity has been through this and in fact, we’ve been through a lot worse. In my grandparent’s lifetime I think of the depression and World War II. Those were uncertain periods, but men and women who lived through those times grew old to be known for generosity, kindness, patience and many other good things.

Of course, many of those kind, generous, and patient people also relied on God in those times of uncertainty, and I believe that this moment will do that for us as well. This is actually a moment that will make us more hopeful, patient, generous, and kind if we let it and if we turn to God to lead us. With that in mind, I want to encourage you to continue to form your children in our faith during this period of time.

For those who participate in religious education, we have your child’s workbooks, and if you would like for us to mail them to you, we certainly can. Please call or email Sister Tita and Sister Naty to arrange this. They can be reached at re@strose-longview.org or the above telephone number.

There are also many good online resources to share with your children.

Charles Smiley Extreme S.P.

See the SP battle back to respectability in the early 90s. The aborted merger with the Santa Fe during the 1980s left both lines greatly weakened and the SP seemed to be the worst victim. Both lines made heroic turn-arounds but this story is how the SP pulled it off. The Extreme part of the title isn’t kidding. The location covered are the toughest places the SP had to grapple with. We feature many specially created maps and graphical grade profiles to bring greater understanding of these lines. Lines to the north, Cascade and Shasta, Donner Pass, and rare Modoc Line views. The Modoc Line is another example of a Union Pacific “redundant-reject” in their plans -- once they captured the SP property as their own. Many choice scenes from hundreds of hours of material to show the great variety of SP power and scenic locations. Some of the material is from early 1970’s film to round out the presentation. Don’t miss the great snow fighting on the Donner Pass Line. Cabooses and a parade of great SP power! To Quote a review in Trains magazine, “The locations are well-chosen and the camera-work is “tack-sharp”. The Modoc segment makes extensive use of maps, including grade profiles, and captions….” Featuring: • Modoc Line
• Shasta Line
• Donner Line

Prerequisites

The graph layout programs from the GraphViz library (http://graphviz.org/) are
used to render the end result. Whilst you can produce a dot file without them,
you will need them for the final rendering.
On Mac OS X with MacPorts installed, do this at the bash prompt.

$ sudo port install graphviz

On Debian based systems, do this:

$ sudo apt-get install graphviz

And so on.
You will need a PDF viewer to see the results.

Simple usage

To produce a call graph as a PDF, make sure that both this module and the
module you wish to analyse are loaded, then do this:

?- module_dotpdf(<module_name>,[]).

This will produce a PDF file <module_name>.pdf in the current directory.
Often, the default layout program, dot, will produce a very wide graph.
This can sometimes be alleviated by using the unflatten program from the
Graphviz tools. In module_dotpdf/2, the default layout method does actually
use unflatten without any parameters, but if this is not enough, you can

The graph compilation relies on prolog_walk_code/1 to do the actual code
analysis. This does a good job in most cases, using meta-predicate declarations
or inferred meta-predicates to detect many high-order calling patterns.
Ironically enough, callgraph fails to analyse itself fully because
prolog_walk_code/1 does not detect that it itself calls a given predicate
for each call detected. Thus, in the example, there is no edge from

Theistic or worshipper?

So a while ago I started having a bit of self-doubt because people called me a "poser" or a "mouse" or any other weird word, just because I literally worship both Satan and Lucifer.

The reasons I worship Satan and Lucifer is because they made my life really good and happy, and I also see Satan and Lucifer as good gods who do good things. Satan and Lucifer let people do what they want except harm. Well, this is my belief that Satan and Lucifer don't let people harm anyone, because even if I am a Satan and Lucifer worshipper, I still believe in LaVeyan morals and stuff, because LaVeyan stuff are honestly good stuff.. Like his morals of not harming children nor animals. But Satan and Lucifer just let people do what they want, like watching whatever people want, listening to whatever music people want, etc. And I believe that Anton LaVey actually got those morals from Lord Satan himself but he (LaVey) didn't know that Satan was telling those morals to LaVey. So I am technically a mix of Theistic and LaVeyan Satanist...

These are the reasons why I worship Satan and Lucifer. I don't worship Satan and Lucifer because I want to hurt people or because I want to be a rival to the Abrahamic religions. I truly believe Satan and Lucifer are against harm. Except self-defense is okay, but I don't really wanna cast magick that breaks people's free will.

Am I a theistic Satanist, or a Satan worshipper? I hope I am not a poser though...

You may believe anything you wish.You may worship any God.It is nobody else's business.If you are happy with your beliefs, then they are yours! So long as you don't try to "force" your beliefs on anybody else

The Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) today said that politicians were attempting to alter the diversity of population in Sri Lanka by backing the resettlement of one ethnic group in a specific area ignoring others. “Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen was also involved in forest annihilation in Willpattu National Park. It seems he is not giving up. We can prove that the Minister is influencing Government officers to evict Tamils from lands in Mullative, Mannar, Vavuniya and Kantale to settle Muslims,” he told a news conference. BBS Chief Executive Officer Dilantha Vithanage charged that their allegation against the Minister was true and they already have the evidence to prove that the Minister was seizing lands by force.

It is not for nothing that people from rural, drought-prone villages in Sri Lanka’s northern Vavuniya district, a former war zone, say that water is more precious than gold. Less than 5 percent of the district’s residents have running water in their homes. For the rest, fetching water from the closest wells or reservoirs is a back-breaking daily endeavor. Vavuniya is also known for pesticide-, fertilizer- and fluoride-contaminated groundwater. [ Full Report ]

At least 42 people have been killed and nine are reported missing as heavy rains continue to hit various parts of Sri Lanka after more than a week. The Disaster Management Centre says flooding in central, north central and eastern Sri Lanka has displaced thousands, and more than 17,000 people have been housed in 100 relief camps. The Meteorological department forecasts heavy rains to continue for another week, [ Full Report ]

fficials in northern Sri Lanka’s Vavuniya District say 60 percent of the rice harvest could be lost if the dry weather continues. “In Mannar District [in the north] we have records indicating that between 5,000 to 6,000 paddy hectares of the cultivated 10,000 are lost,” Ravi Vinanithambi, an environment officer for the North East Reawakening Programme (NERP - part of the Ministry of Economic Development), told IRIN.

Imagine if you had
to choose either one of the above and yet have to look as gorgeous? Difficult?

There are little
things around that speak more than the power of teamwork. The perfect outfit
always doubles up to be #twiceasnice with the perfect makeup. Likewise, when beauty
blogger Priyanjana of Moonshine and Sunlight teams with fashion blogger Pooja

While the former
blushes and pouts with her perfectly done makeup, hair and nails, the latter
poses and walks around donning the season's trends. The knacks of both clubbed

30 Nov Visual Cues Can Turn Back the Clock in a Retirement Facility

Scientific research proves that the environment in which people work and live affects the mind, which in turn affects behavior, which in turn defines a person’s experience in that space. Depending on the outcome of that experience, it can influence a person’s quality of life positively or negatively.

Having a space that supports those who live in it is the intention behind an Integrated Space.™ Creating an Integrated Space is even more important when the people involved are seniors. How do we create a space that helps them transition to a new version of “home” that supports another phase of their life?

In an article published in December 2012 in AIArchitect, environmental psychologist and interior designer Migette Kaup explains: “Architectural cues can provide reinforcement to the desired behaviors that we would like to see enacted in specific place types.” She was referencing her work in a Kansas retirement community where she was attempting to create an environment that nourished and supported the residents. Incorporating residential touches in hallways like rocking chairs and installing different residential doorways entering into apartments to underscore an entry into an individual’s home were part of her plan to create a home-like feeling for seniors.

A controversial study was done in 1979 by Harvard psychologist Ellen Langer entitled “Counterclockwise” explored the question of environment and how it might impact an aging population psychologically.

Langer re-created an environment that was identical to one 20 years prior (1959). Eight men between the ages of 75 and 80 and in various stages of decline were dressed in clothes of that timeframe, listened to 50’s music, watched television programs from that era, lived with corresponding décor and furnishings, and read books and magazines in line with this new reality.

They didn’t just reminisce about that time of their lives but lived with cues that they were actually 20 years younger. Langer included no mirrors in their space; they couldn’t wear modern clothing or watch the current news on television. They could only have photos of themselves from that time or earlier.

The results? One week later, the men tested better on intelligence test scores. A comparison of photos taken when they arrived and when they left showed a reversal in age and many did not need their canes.

Although Langer has received criticism about this study because it had not been peer-reviewed and replicated, the study still shows that with a surrounding

Your body is made up of some 60 trillion cells. In every moment of every day, these cells conduct more than a million different kinds of biochemical reactions. Health is simply the reflection of how efficiently these reactions occur.

Unfortunately, cells can’t always work as they should. When they lack energy, raw materials or “trigger” nutrients, at least some of their chores are left undone. The same is true as cells are damaged by free radicals, bad fats, or excess sugar.

Although Pure Essence is only 13 years old, our founder and chief formulator has been designing supplements for over 30 years. In 1984, he founded Rainbow Light Nutritional Systems, Inc., where he created the world’s first “food-based” supplements, the world’s first “green food” complexes, the world’s first line of digestive enzymes, the world’s first therapeutic enzyme products, and so on. So, even if you’ve never used a Pure Essence product, you've used something that he created, or that his creations inspired.

Now, with the Cellular Concept of Health as his guide, he’s created the world’s first supplements that combine the best of evidence based nutrition with the ancient wisdom of the world’s great holistic medical systems. That means that our multiples provide thousands of phytonutrients that are missing in others; nutrients that are absolutely vital to complete cellular health. And, it means that our condition and organ specific formulas are more supportive than any others you will find.

In short, the Cellular Concept of Health translates into supplements and nutraceuticals that not only support health, but actually build it. This means, in turn, that you’ll feel better, stronger, more energetic and more alive with our products than with any other supplements on Earth. It also means that in every product we make, you’ll address not just symptoms, but they’re underlying cause.

There has simply never before been anything like Pure Essence. Of course, words are cheap. But, experience is not, and our products provide the ultimate nutritional experience. Because of that, they’re guaranteed beyond any condition.

So, the next time you’re deciding on whose product to use, give us a try. We cost a bit more, because our products contain so much more than others. But, it’s what they contain that produces the results they provide.

So my little baby, who will still let me call you “my little baby”, who are you at six? This has been a big year for you. We moved from the only house and the only city you had ever known to a new house and a new city. And you started kindergarten, the beginning of your school journey. Both of those big transitions you took in stride. School has been a dream. You were very ready for kindergarten. You are lucky enough to have a wonderful teacher and I jokingly call you the mayor of your classroom. All the kids like you. Your teacher told us that he can put you at any table in his classroom and you work well with the other children. Your only fault in school, according to him, is that you tend to rush through your work. You are so busy and want to know what is next. Just like Daddy. You are very very bright. Just like Daddy. You hate to be wrong and hate to be hurt and hate to be embarrassed. Just like Daddy. You are very good at finding things. Just like Daddy.

I find so much joy in holding your hand, always warm and slightly sticky, and just talking with you. Your voice continues to be high and scratchy and I love the sound of it. You have so many funny ideas, so many good questions, so much curiosity about the world, and so much kindness in your heart. You play imaginative games with Legos and figures and most of the time you and Graham get along really well. You are interested in magic and science and you aren’t afraid of much. You will go on a roller coaster with Daddy while Graham will sit on the sidelines with me. You sometimes act as an interpreter for Graham when I don’t understand what he is saying and I hope you will continue to do for him, both with us and at school. You also tend to tattle a lot and have been to known to fall to the ground in frustration. Currently you play basketball and go to karate and watching you attempt jumping jacks, with your arms not quite in synch with your legs, makes me smile and tear up at the same time.

I walk you to school each day and you are heartbroken on the days when I need to drop you off. I know the day is coming when you won’t want me to walk you in at all. I cherish that you hold my hold all the way to your classroom, allow me to help you

The Excise and Prohibition Department of Andhra Pradesh on Tuesday seized a huge quantity of ganja In Visakhapatanam's Hukumpet mandal in the Agency area, and arrested two people while they transporting more than two tonnes of the plant.

As per official estimates, the seized contraband is worth more than Rs 2 crore.

The Times of India reported that the enforcement wing of the Excise Department was tipped off about 2,290 kg of dry ganja being transported in a van at Uppa in Hukumpet mandal under the Paderu excise station limits on Tuesday.

The report adds that, following this, Inspector P Muralidhar and sub-inspector U Nageswara Rao of the excise enforcement wing, along with their staff intercepted the van and nabbed the accused.

The two persons who were arrested in the case were identified as VV Chinna Rao (27) from the Visakhapatnam Agency area and J Bala Murugan (32) from Madurai in Tamil Nadu, media reports add.

Assistant Commissioner of Excise (Enforcement) SVVN Babji Rao told The Hindu that the ganja was neatly packed in gunny bags and covered with tarpaulin. A person who was travelling on a motorbike, acted as a pilot for the van and was supposed to travel ahead and inform about inspections.

“We intercepted the pilot first and then caught the van. However, the driver of the van managed to escape,” the police official told the newspaper.

The Hans India reported that the drivers were told to ensure that the ganja reached Karasapadu area, from where others would take it to Tamil Nadu.

Along with the van, one motor cycle and a mobile phone, Rs 24, 000 in cash was also seized.

Ganja is grown at a large scale in the Agency area of Visakhapatnam, and officials suspect that a lot of Maoists are involved in cultivation of the plant, and use the money gained from its sale, for their activities.

Earlier this week, Roads and Buildings Minister Ayyanna Patrudu alleged that officials knew the people who were cultivating the plant, and demanded that strict action be taken against them.

Next course was for me the star of the evening; a complex
kombu broth with cod, lobster and a
crisp of seaweed. The broth was earthy and well balanced and was a wonderful
base for the sweetness of the cod and lobster. The fish was tender and well
cooked and I loved the seaweed crisp which provided a good textural contrast.
It was a joy to eat.

What followed was a quail jelly served with a langoustine
cream and an accompanying duck liver crisp. The jelly had herby layers of flavour
beneath and the langoustine cream gave a nice sweetness as a contrast to the earthy flavour of the quail. The underlying layer of herbs at the bottom of the jelly was quite strong and you had to take care
not to get too much otherwise the mint in the herbs overpowered the whole dish.
We were instructed to take one bite of the jelly and then a bite of the crisp
and pâté when eating, both dishes had a nice depth of flavour.

Next up, the nitro bloody mary. This dish is a definite nod
to the chef’s time at the Fat Duck (they used to have a nitro green tea mousse
which was served at the beginning of the meal as a fun palate cleanser). So we had the theatre of the tomatoes being
prepared in a bowl of liquid nitrogen, thereby freezing them and then served in
a glass with a clear preparation of bloody mary and an accompanying fever tree
tonic. This was topped with a heritage tomato “pan con tomate”. It was an interesting dish but
something more suited to summer rather than the depths of winter.

The poussin with duck liver which followed was well cooked but lacked a
depth of flavour and was served with asparagus. I love asaparagus, its one of
my favourite vegetables, but not when it’s out of season. So for me the dish was a bit disappointing as it
didn’t pack the punch I was expecting as I also love poussin.

I will preface the following dishes with a profound apology,
more so because my camera got it’s knickers in a twist and managed to lose the
pictures that I took.

Extreme conditions tests. “Kicking the tires” of models has been a good idea since the beginning. This is an ingrained SD habit, and Vensim provides Reality Check™ to automate it. It’s not clear that this would have revealed the VaR sum vs. average error, because that’s a matter of numerical sensitivity that might not reveal itself as a noticeable change in behavior. But I bet it would reveal lots of other problems with the model boundary and limitations to validity of relationships.

Abstraction. System Dynamics focuses on variables as containers for time series, and distinguishes stocks (state variables) from flows and other auxiliary conversions. Most SD languages also include some kind of array facility, like subscripts in Vensim, for declarative processing of detail complexity. Excel basically lacks such conventions, except for named ranges that are infrequently used. Time and other dimensions exist spatially as row-column layout. This means that an Excel model is full of a lot of extraneous material for handling dynamics, is stuck in discrete time, can’t be checked for DT stability, and requires a lot of manual row-column fill operations to express temporal phenomena that are trivial in SD and many other languages. With less busywork needed, it might have been much easier for auditors to discover the VaR error.

Readable equations. It’s not uncommon to encounter =E1*EXP($D$3)*SUM(B32:K32)^2/(1+COUNT(A32:K32)) in Excel. While it’s possible to create such gobbledygook in Vensim, it’s rare to actually encounter it, because SD software and habits encourage meaningful variable names and “chunking” equations into comprehensible components. Again, this might have made it much easier for auditors to discover the VaR error.

Graphical representation of structure. JPMorgan should get some credit for having a model audit process at all, even though it failed to prevent the error. Auditors’ work is much easier when they can see what the heck is going on in the model. SD software provides useful graphical conventions for revealing model structure. Excel has no graphics. There’s an audit tool, but it’s hampered by the lack of a variable concept, and it’s slower to use than Vensim’s Causal Tracing™.

I think the score’s Forrester 8, Gates 1. Excel is great for light

Scanning electron microscope image of a trap entrance with a small angle of ∼30° between trapdoor (td) and threshold (th). A longitudinal section of the trap entrance of terrestrial U. longifolia is shown; note the pavement epithelium (pe) and quadrifid glands (qg). Source: Poppinga et al. 2016

The way a bladderwort catches its prey is to wait for prey animals (mainly small crustaceans) to touch trigger hairs situated on the trapdoor which closes the trap watertight. Once this happens, it has a bladder snap open. The inside of the bladder is empty, so water, and anything nearby in it, is sucked in with an acceleration over 600 times the force of gravity. Getting water to flow rapidly into the trap is the key to the bladderwort’s success, but understanding how these traps exactly work is not easy.

Simon Poppinga of the research team said: “The bladderwort traps are considered as some of the most complex structures in the plant kingdom. They are tiny, they are ultrafast in their sucking motion and they are complicated to investigate. Though being intensively studied not only since Darwin’s benchmark book about carnivorous plants, there are still many mysteries about how these devices function. With our review we aimed at putting all relevant biophysical and structural information together and to inspire further research on these enigmatic devices.”

Recent advances include using scanning electron microscopes that are capable of seeing far more detail than a standard light microscope.

While reviewing studies of bladderwort traps, Poppinga and coworkers noted that not all bladderworts are alike.

Poppinga said: “You might think that if the selective pressure on the traps is just about an optimized water flow, then the traps would look more or less identical. But when we looked closely into trap architecture during our experimental studies we found that different plants have different structural arrangements, which has also been noted by earlier authors. This is probably caused by the fact that different species of bladderwort live in different environments and, hence, might show structural adaptations to the respective habitat – for example, terrestrial bladderworts often have, in contrast to aquatic species, to cope with seasonal dryness which would make the traps functionless. We think this might also mean the traps are adapted to lure and to catch different kinds of prey, and this is something botanists need to test.”

Despite the variety of architecture, the traps all share a similar method of

No. This post is not about Elf. Not really.

First, it was inspired by a Christmas song I heard on klove radio the other day. The lyrics went like this:

"Empty manger, perfect stranger, about to be born. Into darkness, sadness, desperate madness, creation so torn. We were so lost on earth, no peace, no worth. no way to escape. In fear, no faith, no hope, no grace, and no light but that was the night before Christmas. Warm hay, cold sweat, a mother, not yet." The Night Before Christmas, by Brandon Heath

This song, contrasting out lost state before the coming of the Messiah to the hope we now have in him, got me to thinking. Immediately I was so grateful that Jesus is not a stranger to me. In the words of Buddy the elf, "I know him!" We are familiar with each other. We communicate daily. He knows my name, my fears, even my favorite color. (See what I did there? :p)

The other day, our advent devotional featured this verse:

John 15:14-16 "You are My friends if you do what I command you.I do not call you slaves anymore, because a slave doesn’t know what his masteris doing. I have called you friends, because I have made known to you everything I have heard from My Father.You did not choose Me, but I chose you."

God wants you to get to know him. He wants a personal TWO-WAY relationship between you both. He says through Jeremiah, "But the one who boasts should boast in this, that he understands and knows Me— that I am Yahweh, showing faithful love, justice, and righteousness on the earth, for I delight in these things. This is the Lord’s declaration."

Is Jesus your friend? Do you know him? Are you seeking to know him better, as he sought you?

That's the beauty of twin secondary windings, they are isolated from each other. Separating the transformers simply follows the same isolation. Unfortunately twin transformers also increases the regulation unless you choose very large transformers which have lower regulation.

Q. What kind of improvement do we get by adding an extra power supply?
A. By adding another power supply, you make it into a complete mono structure. It also adds more power (does not double though) and current capacity. The result is an airier, deeper soundstage and more authotity through the entire frequency range.

Lets start with a transformer. I use Plitron 300VA, 2 x 22V AC in all my amps, both stereo and dual mono. It is is approx $100 for a single unit. Getting similar Avel transformer from Partsexpress will cost you $50/pc.

If I order custom transformers, I prefer secondary at the core with wire diameter 1.8mm (for 300VA unit). I tested some amorphous core custom transformers and they sounded marginally better than standard core.

If your transformer comes with a standard mounting hardware, that's what you use.

Plitrons are epoxy filled and hardware is not included. I increase the hole

Negative-space manicures have actually been among the significant nail design art choices for a great deal of men and women in the past couple of calendar year, as they’ve thrilled people around the world by using their innovation and beauty. A french manicure by means of a lavender rather than a white is what you will need.

Stick a bit of scotch tape on a single portion of the nail and apply a yellow color on the opposite side. With wonderful nail art ideas for each exceptional occasion you’ve got or day-to-day use. Alternatively, you can opt for the safe alternatives that guarantee the successful results of your manicure session. You can also locate the alternatives of toenails tinted with flowery styles in addition to, rhinestone styles that’s a kind of 3-D toe nail style. Fashion choices will be precisely the surface of the animal or an individual pattern on every finger. Another elegant decision to finish a festive look is going to be cat eye manicure. The benefit of gel nail polish is that it’s very easy to deal with, and stays longer.

Nail painting isn’t a type of art, but a craze among girls to seem cool and appealing. Then you can begin painting! It’s practical to use an acrylic paint that’s water-based so that it is easy to modify your art as you cooperate. If you adore colors and understand how to draw, then this design might be your favorite too. Matte nail colors are getting more and more popular.

Silver glitter polish is an excellent investment. Unlike the prior tutorials, you are going to be using a readymade glitter polish to produce this glitter nail art design look during its very best.

Screening, Assessment, and Referral Practices in Adult Correctional Settings: A National Perspective

A national survey of adult prisons, jails, and community correctional agencies was conducted to examine the practices used to place offenders in appropriate treatment services. 289 administrators of adult facilities completed the survey (34% from prisons, 14.2% from jails, 24.6% from state-run community correctional facilities, and 27.2% from locally-run community correctional facilities). 58.2% of survey respondents reported the use of a standardized substance abuse-screening tool, and 34.2% reported use of an actuarial risk tool. The provision of higher intensity treatment programs, the use of standardized risk tools, and the provision of more community referral services were all independently associated with the use of a standardized substance abuse-screening tool.

Review of Office-Based Maintenance Treatment of Opioid Dependence

The increasing global public health burden of heroin dependence and prescription opioid dependence warrants further expansion of treatment models. The most effective intervention for opioid dependence remains maintenance with methadone, a full mu-opioid receptor agonist, or buprenorphine, a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist. A growing body of evidence supports the use of opioid receptor agonist maintenance in office-based settings. Office-based opioid treatment (OBOT) can expand treatment access in a less stigmatized environment, which enables integrated care of co-morbid conditions. The authors discuss clinical and practical considerations when providing treatment for opioid dependence in traditional versus office-based settings include patient selection and monitoring, health economics, management of co-morbid conditions, and access to ancillary psychosocial treatment. OBOT provides an additional opportunity to help address the tremendous public health impact of opioid dependence. Gunderson, E. and Fiellin, D.

Cons

Only one piece for top and bottom

Puts pressure on gums

Boiling needs to be done just right to get proper fit

Unit is slightly large for some

Does not allow jaw movement

Summary

The Brain-Pad is designed to protect the teeth and jaw from impact during low-impact sporting activities but is designed in a way that allows those with sleep problems to use it as well. It has a one piece form that can be molded to fit your mouth and also allows air through.

This makes it work well for sporting because even when the teeth are clenched it keeps them from grinding together. When it comes to sleep apnea the unit keeps the teeth apart and provides a small opening in the center that allows for breathing.

Made in three different colors, you can use this unit for a variety of different purposes and also don’t have to worry about it slipping or sliding. This is one of the drawbacks that have been mentioned because it does not allow for movement of the jaw, however it’s also important for overall usage if you are trying to keep yourself from grinding your teeth or losing that gap in the center that allows for better breathing throughout the night. The Brain-Pad unit also includes a warranty and an anti-microbial case to keep it protected when not in use.

Possible Alternatives

If you’re looking for something a little more unique, SnoreDoc is a great method of relieving sleep apnea and also eliminating snoring and teeth grinding. It uses a small bulb that is placed inside the mouth and suctioned to the tongue, therefore clearing the airway and then provides plenty of space to keep the teeth apart and still get air in and out of the airway without problem.

The Intelliguard Pro is a more expensive option that is designed in separate pieces that connects in your choice of configurations. This allows the jaw to move more freely and allows you to decide how far open you want your mouth to be during sleep. This way it’s designed to work for those with sleep apnea as well as other problems.

One final option is mouth props. These are simple to use and inexpensive to buy but they are generally not good for long term use or use throughout the night as the pieces are small. These simply fit in the corners of the mouth and keep it open to ensure that there are no obstructions when breathing. They are not fitted however and only stay as long as you continue to cl

Merchants participating in Amazon.com's much-advertised "Prime Day" sale saw an 80 percent rise in U.S. sales from a year earlier, according to preliminary data from e-commerce researcher ChannelAdvisor, although the event also drew ire from some shoppers.

Merchants participating in Amazon.com's much-advertised "Prime Day" sale saw an 80 percent rise in U.S. sales from a year earlier, according to preliminary data from e-commerce researcher ChannelAdvisor, although the event also drew ire from some shoppers.

The one-day sale on Wednesday, which did not apply to Irish shoppers, was for members of Amazon's $99 per year Prime subscription service and is similar to an annual sale by China e-commerce merchant Alibaba.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc also launched an online sale on Wednesday, a sign that the nation's largest retailer was concerned that Amazon was gaining market share, Gilford Securities analyst Bernard Sosnick said.

Discounts on products ranging from storage sets to robotic vacuum cleaners sent orders per minute at the peak higher than on "Black Friday, the term for the day after Thanksgiving, which traditionally has been the top retail sales day in the United States, Amazon said. It did not give detailed sales numbers but said it sold 35,000 Lord of the Rings Blu-Ray sets in 15 minutes and that a Kate Spade handbag was sold out in a minute.

Some Amazon shoppers vented on Twitter that Prime Day deals were selling out too quickly and complained that deals were not attractive enough.

Adobe Digital Index said that 50 percent of overall sentiment related to Prime Day on social media was about disappointment.

"Much of the disappointed chatter focused on the lack of blockbuster deals," it said, adding that users cited sales of less desirable items like socks and towels.

An Amazon spokeswoman said the retailer was listening to its customers and planned to add more deals like TVs.

ChannelAdvisor calculated the 80 percent rise in U.S. sales as of 12 p.m. ET (1600 GMT) based on sales by partner retailers that sell on Amazon.com.

Sales rose 40 percent in Amazon Europe, ChannelAdvisor said.

Amazon declined to comment on the data.

Prior to their appearance at the Istanbul Biennial 2015, drawings by Christine Taylor Patten will be exhibited at Leyden Gallery. The micro/macro drawings are part of a continuum of 2000 2.5 cm crowquill and black ink drawings made over 40 years. Curated by Art Historian Griselda Pollock.

About

Because my eyes are drawing eyes, I sometimes see things that others might not think of as drawings. Christine Taylor Patten

These drawings are part of the artist’s micro/macro series, which she began in 1998. This series consists of 2,001 works: a continuum of 2,000 one-by-one-inch drawings and 1 seven-by-twenty-four-feet drawing. This exhibition will consist of 250 of the intricately wrought, crow quill and ink micros as well as a large scale study for the macro entitled imagine2. The micro/macro drawings on display are crowquill and black ink drawings that progress from a single dot in space that breaks apart and then evolves into myriad movements, each one referencing the previous drawing and promising new possibilities for another. Patten says that she is ‘fascinated by the interconnections that happened as the series progresses, exposing familiar form caused by what has come before. The images reiterate each other yet they are changing from one movement to another, ad infinitum, with each pen stroke responding to what has already happened in the drawing. At each point of convergence the direction of the image is arbitrary, unplanned, evolving amongst the infinite possibilities generated by the process.’

The show is co-curated by Adriana Cerne and the esteemed Art Historian Griselda Pollock who will give a talk on the work of Christine Taylor Patten at Leyden Gallery on the 13th March. Pollock is also an advisor to the Istanbul Biennale in 2015, where Christine Taylor Patten’s work will be exhibited following its appearance at Leyden Gallery.

As Griselda Pollock has said of this work, it is ‘Abstract, yet akin to contemporary scientific researches into chaos theory and turbulence, Christine Taylor Patten's work resonates with contemporary physics but also with music and the visual arts. Bach and Vermeer are invoked by the artist as her mentors and models, the one endlessly fascinated with the very possibilities of musical form yet deeply and passionately ethical and spiritual, the other quiet

Farm Bill: Congress is now keeping farmer’s hours to avert the dairy cliff

Farm Bill: Congress is now keeping farmer’s hours to avert the dairy cliff

Date:

Mon, 12/31/2012

As 2012 comes to a close, the halls of Congress will look like a well-lighted dairy barn.

by Corey Geiger, Hoard’s Dairyman Assistant Managing Editor

Late December is traditionally the time of year when Americans spend time with their families. Not so if you are a congressional staffer, an elected national official . . . or even a dairy farmer. The halls of Congress are filled with late-year hustle and bustle as national leaders try to avoid the self-created fiscal cliff. Dairy also has its own cliff.

Even President Obama has joined the discussion because on New Year’s Day the 1949 Permanent Farm Bill law would go into effect. It would require USDA to begin buying dairy products at the equivalent of $38 per hundredweight. That would not be healthy for consumers or the long-term balance of the dairy industry. However, it is that threat of the 1949 Permanent Farm Bill law that is causing the late-year debate on dairy policy.

All that said, today could be the day long-term dairy policy gets passed or we may just kick the can down the road. If it has any chance, you better get on the phone and call your legislators, in both the House and Senate, to let them know your opinion on dairy legislation.

What are the current options? There are three (3) House Bills that have been filed:

1. There is a 78-page draft bill that has been posted which includes an extension of the farm bill through next September 30. Since dairy really has no national program in place, this potential legislation also includes the Dairy Security Act (DSA) with its margin protection program. This option has the support of the Agriculture Committee Chairs: Senator Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Representative Lucas (R-Okla.)

For dairy, this is basically the bill that was passed by the Senate and House Ag Committee earlier this year. As David Rogers of Politico wrote on December 30, the legislative process to pass this version has been stopped by Speaker John Boehner (

In House of Cards, Frank Underwood, the character incarnated by the one and only Kevin Spacey, keeps trying to deal with his smoking addiction and, in the scene below, has already found the solution explaining, in just a single sentence, what vaping is all about in his eyes: “Addiction without the consequences”:

Late Show with David Letterman

If you really want to know more about vaping we suggest you read a study like this one, and not let Katherine Heigl explain it all to you.

You see, as she admitted on the Late Show with David Letterman, she doesn’t really know how e-cigarettes work but she, at least, knew that it is “a fun, not-that-bad-for-you addiction.” Luckily, a study published two years later by the British government proved her right.

David Letterman, who, as he has said to Oprah in the past, has not smoked in 30 years, also had three puffs describing Heigl’s e-liquid flavor as, “remarkable.”

The Tourist

We are sure you remember The Tourist, the 2010 movie in which Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp played the spies that everybody wanted to sleep with. In the scene below, Depp’s character, Frank, is enjoying his e-cig on a train when Elise Clifton-Ward (Angelina Jolie) spots him.

Of course, he forgot about his e-cigarette after this contact. Come on, who wouldn’t?

Off- to On-Screen

In fact, many movie stars have switched to vaping as a healthier alternative, with Jack Nicholson, John Cusack, Lindsay Lohan, Leonardo DiCaprio and many more, using their e-cigarettes daily.

For example, Zac Efron, who used to be one of Hollywood’s heaviest smokers, now vapes and his character, Teddy, on the movie Neighbors, was a vaper as well. The same goes for the extraordinary Sienna Miller, who was vaping during the Golden Globes Awards, in a room full of people where the use of e-cigarettes—of course—was permitted.

Hard Out Here

And let’s not forget about music videos. The vaping industry is getting bigger and bigger as time goes by, and it has

Heart disease. Cancer. Chronic lower respiratory disease. These are the leading causes of death for the average American.

But for some our most vulnerable citizens — children age 1 to 13— it’s car crashes.

Child Passenger Safety Week in September is as good an excuse as any to remind ourselves of the dangers kids face in and around cars — and with annual traffic fatalities projected to hit a decade high, it’s an even better one.

In 2015, 663 children 12 or younger died in car crashes. While that was less than half that of 40 years earlier, it was the highest since 2009 following four consecutive years of decreases.

Meanwhile, studies show that some 600,000 infants to 12-year-olds rode in vehicles without a car seat, booster seat or seatbelt. Among those who died in collisions, 35 percent were not properly secured.

What’s more, among those who were in a car seat or booster seat, nearly half the devices were used incorrectly, diminishing their effectiveness. Proper child restraint use reduces the risk of serious or fatal injuries by 45 to 71 percent.

So what’s proper?

Using a correctly installed restraint appropriate to the child passenger’s age, height and weight.

Another issue that remains important even as summer gives way to fall and beyond: Vehicular heatstroke spiked last year with nearly 40 deaths of children in hot cars. Keep in mind that in-car temperatures can rise from 80 to 110 degrees in just 20 minutes, and that children’s body temperature can rise as much as five times faster than an adult’s on its way to a deadly 104 degrees.

Leaving a reminder in the backseat so you don’t forget they’re back there — like your smartphone or purse — can help. Some automakers have begun offering automated rear-seat reminders that sound chimes and even honk the horn if a child is left in the back seat.

And if you see a child alone in a car, call 911. Afraid causing a scene or getting someone in trouble?

Week 5 has arrived! I dislike (I don’t like to use the word “hate”) the fact that the season is going by so quickly. Either way, here we are and we need to get you that win in week 5. Every week I will help you by looking at the Expert Consensus Rankins (ECR) to make these decisions a little easier on the Sharks. Let’s go ahead and look at some RB3, RB4, WR4 and WR5 types that you can flex during Week 5. Let’s get “flexy”, shall we?

Running Backs

Lindsay continues to impress me. I could put Royce Freeman here as well, really. I like both, yet I own no shares (tis’ life, am I right?) of either. Lindsay has averaged 5.9 yards per carry on the short year, and that’s while out-touching Freeman 45-44 (I know…1 measly carry, but it’s still the lead). For the recency bias folks, Monday night showed Lindsay having 14 touches to Freeman’s 8. This trend should continue when Denver travels to New York to face the Jets. The Broncos’ clearly love Lindsay, and you should too.

Powell is another guy that continues to be disrespected. Ironically, this is on the other side (from Lindsay) of the ball in week 5. Powell continued his growth in running back snaps in week 4, as he out-snapped Isaiah Crowell 36-20. My, how the tides have turned. Powell also saw 7 targets in week 4 (compared to 1 for Crowell). Powell opens up every contest as the starter for the Jets and continues to see more snaps than Crowell (it increases every week). You get it…right? I hope so, as Powell is a great flex this week (and a safe one for the foreseeable future).

Buck Allen never gets any love (reiterating this from last week). Alex Collins was downgraded to “did not practice” (or DNP) on Thursday, so Allen could have the lion-share of running back touches for Baltimore in week 5. In his first 3 games on the season, Allen had 4 touchdowns (3 rushing and 1 receiving), as well as 17 targets in the passing game. Cleveland is not a daunting matchup for running backs, so feel free to use the underappreciated back in week 5 (especially if

Microsoft invested $200,000 to the Accessibility Lighthouse Program, which is designated to help provide resources to students with disabilities, in collaboration with colleges on campus.

The investment will help students with Autism go into STEM roles and increase the hiring pipeline into the industry, Katheryne Rehberg, associate director of corporate relations, said.

The program will run throughout the College of ACES, College of Engineering, College of AHS and College of Education. According to the ACES website, the program was launched on June 4 and will run through June 2019.

Another goal of the program is to create a digitally accessible campus for students with disabilities.

“Microsoft is going to help us with tools in a classroom to make the classroom more digitally accessible, and what that means is that when professors are teaching in class, as they’re teaching, their lecture will be transcribed in real time into print on the screen,” Rehberg said.

With the investment for the Accessibility Lighthouse Program, students will also have more opportunities to learn how to create digitally accessible software.

The digitally accessible software will help students with different disabilities. Such software includes alternative text on photos, which reads words on a computer screen out loud to people, and being able to change the color of the text or backgrounds, making it easier for students with disabilities such as dyslexia to read a computer screen.

Although a pillar of Microsoft’s investment is helping those with Autism, the money and Accessibility Lighthouse Program will also help people with all kinds of disabilities, physical and mental, throughout the University.

“The University, for the first time, is going to have an accessibility policy in place… and so Microsoft has really applauded the University for being a front-runner with all things accessibility, and really thinking about the entire population,” Rehberg said.

Microsoft has been hiring and helping people with disabilities, which makes others look to them for help, Patricia Malik, interim director for the Division of Disability Resources and Educational Services, said.

“Microsoft has a pretty strong onboarding and hiring process for people with disabilities. They’re very intentional about it. It’s not been around for very long, but they really want to do it well and other corporations around the country look to them for advice, or support, or best practice,” Malik said.

DRES will be doing a lot of work in career services with the money Microsoft invested

So if they are potentially long running, you are stuck
with them running, you are stuck waiting for them.
We recommend that you never use this approach
when managing dependent tasks especially if you need
to make the same modification for a batch of records.
Now, another technique that we see is to simply get rid
of the asynchronous nature of the API perhaps
by introducing a semaphore and waiting on it.
This can get hairy in a couple of situations too.

You should almost never try to do this.
If you do, you should keep in mind that especially
if you wait forever for operations to complete,
it it is very easy for you to end
up with circular dependencies that end
up causing a deadlock in your app.

Or if you were to ever use this practice on a main thread,
this will block your UI right away on an operation
that is likely waiting on the network and result
in a terrible user experience.
So we don't really recommend it.
What we do recommend is for you to take a look
at the dependency management API that NSOperation offers.
This is what I mean by that API.
NSOperation lets you easily add and remove dependencies
between other NSOperations.
Let's take a look at how this works with CKOperations
that are a subclass of NSOperations.

If we have two dependent fetch records operations
and the second one should not begin before the first one is
completed, all you need to do is set up both of those operations
and add the first fetch as a dependency on the second
and enqueue both of those operations.
This will guarantee that the second fetch does not start
before the first fetch is finished.
You can see this offers you a logical way to think
about the errors for particular operations
and at the same time manage dependencies for them
in a convenient manner.
Now, when thinking about NSOperations
from a performance context,
there is an additional distinction that I would
like you guys to think about.

Not all NSOperations are created equal.
Some of them may have been created
because of an explicit user action
in your apps while others may represent background tasks
that are of lower priority.
To indicate this notion of relative importance
between NSOperations to the system,
in iOS 8 we introduced the quality

Given the actor's age, it seems more likely that he might be up for the part of Dick Grayson/Nightwing for DCE's Titans series (though I suppose that Bell could be the DCEU's Grayson). Besides, if I wanted Robin in The Batman, I would go right past Tim Drake and start looking to cast Damian Wayne.

There is also the issue of a young, teenage or preteen Damian as Robin. I think that it could be made to work (i.e. Hitgirl), but there is still much skepticism over the idea. It seems certain, though, that if Drake Bell is being cast as a Bat Family character then he will be Dick Grayson/Nightwing, either in the DCEU or in Titans.

So, assuming Tim Drake would be in his late teens (or early twenties at most), who would you cast for him?

Ryan Potter is a little older than I would prefer in regards to an actor for Tim Drake, but he would certainly fall within the range of a casting call. I wouldn't have a problem with a half-Japanese Tim, though that might give him too much in common with Bruce's actual mixed-heritage son Damian.

AU's Luke Wyland on strange venues and Denver connections

AU started off as "luc," a solo project of Luke Wyland's when he was attending college in Boston. The band formed after Wyland's graduation, in 2005, when he and some friends took a trip along the West Coast. Settling in Portland, they began carving out a niche for themselves on the strength of Wyland's richly textured experimental pop songs.

Their 2008 album, Verbs, was a marvel of informally orchestrated, organic, ambient pop, and their latest effort, Both Lights, reveals a band that is more coherent and direct in its approach without having lost the playfulness and energy of its earlier work. We recently spoke with Wyland about his fondness for Denver and the new record's prismatic cover art.

Westword:You have a Denver connection from your early national tours, having played Brooks Center Arts in 2008. Tell us about that, and what you enjoy about playing unconventional spaces.

Info

Luke Wyland: We made good friends with a nice community of people there, like Laura Goldhamer and the band she plays in, the Dovekins. We've always had a lot of fun in Denver. It's actually a place that, if I had to move anywhere else in the U.S., it would be there. There's just a very good, open energy there. The first time we came through, we did play [the Brooks Center]. That was an amazing night.

We play houses and raw art spaces and whatnot, and venues as well. We're still a smallish band, and in some places we do well and in some places not as much. For me, at least, I quite enjoy playing those non-traditional places. I feel like there's less of a barrier between the audience and the band. I always end up having a little bit more of a personal experience with the people who are there.

The cover art for Both Lights is interesting; it looks like a cross section of some kind of polished layered stone.

That's exactly what it is. It's a Mexican crazy-lace agate. It's a very high-res scan of a very small part of a stone. Then they printed it on reflective metallic cardboard. I couldn't be happier with it. It was a collaboration with my new record label [Hometapes]. We were bouncing ideas back and forth. The title comes from the idea of

After seeing Amanda’s acne-free, clear complexion, I was eager to try out her new, slightly intensecleansing routine. Basically,you get your water as hot as you can (like burning your hands hot), and soak your face towel. Once you’ve lathered up your product (as I will get to momentarily), cover your face with the hot towel. Take three deep breaths. Relax. Find your inner zen. Then, rinse the towel, and repeat twice more. Finish off by either a) rinsing the remaining product with cold water, or b) rinse towel, scrub your face, then rinse the towel once more with cold water and apply to your face.

I usually look forward to washing my face at night– I mean my makeup usually feels pretty gross by then, plus I cringe at the thought of all the dirt that ends up of my face from just the air and my hands. Nonetheless, whether you wear makeup or not, cleansing before bed is SO important for clear, healthy skin. I use a makeup removing wipe on my cheeks, chin and forehead (only avoiding my eyes, they just sting too much) to get the majority of the product off. Then, I get any remaining foundation/concealer with coconut oil, lathering my face and neck for around 30 seconds (thanks for the idea, Joanna). And I know you’re probably thinking, like why would I want to spread oil on my face, that’s just asking for breakouts, well let me set the record straight. I have extremely oily (I mean it), acne-prone skin, and using coconut oil has not made me 1. breakout nor 2. made my skin more oily (heaven forbid). Plus, it’s like ah-mazing for your skin (along with these other oils). I’d like to think of it as like my all-natural (and much cheaper) dupe for those covet-worthy Shu Uemuera cleansing oils. I take it all off with the routine I listed above, ending off with option b. Now, you may think we’re done, but this is why I say this routine is slightly intense. I then wash my newly open pores with this Avene cleanser, going at it for around 45 seconds to a minute, rinsing with cold water. As you can imagine, I sleep well knowing my face is squeaky clean.



The new regulations are centered around allowing citizens more control over the data that businesses and organizations collect on them. GDPR covers personal data, the information that is used to identify a person (i.e. name, address, or IP address); and sensitive data (i.e. medical information, sexual orientation, and political/religious views); as well as what was covered under the ‘95 Protection Directive. These changes will put more accountability into the hands of the businesses and organizations that collect data.

The Information Commissioner’s Office will be responsible for enforcing GDPR and any ramifications that come from breaking said laws. Under GDPR, citizens now have the right to opt-out of businesses collecting data from them. For example, a browsing site may ask that you opt-in to cookie usage before continuing the use of their site. The data law changes also allow a person to request the data that companies are collecting, for free, by completing a Subject Access Request (SAR). After completion, all businesses and organizations have one month to locate and distribute that person’s data information.

Businesses and organizations, which act as data controllers, have a number of other new rules to follow and keep in mind under GDPR. Companies employing more than 250 employees must hire a Data Protection Officer. Information that doesn’t need to be accessed shouldn’t have the ability to be—data must be deliberate and restricted. It is important to note that these laws apply to outsourced data as well as on-premises data centers. Since GDPR only allows certain countries to be the housing centers for data, physical locations of data centers are important as well. Companies using cloud service providers (data processors) to house their data should also require cloud providers to ensure they are notifying the organization of any security threats as quickly as possible. They should also make sure their data processors are contractually obligated to assume responsibility for the safety and security of the stored data that they hold for a company. If a company destroys, loses, alters, or has an unauthorized disclosure/access to data, they need to report said instance within 72 hours of its occurrence. Again, this is about making businesses more accountable.

Many cloud service providers have already paved the way for GDPR compliance. Amazon’s AWS provides 500+ features and services directly focused on security and compliance. Microsoft’s Azure has been preparing for the GDPR switch for over a year. Microsoft states their extensive experience in developing cloud solutions with built-in security makes them

(feat. Charlie Wilson)

[Intro: Charlie Wilson]And you can't keep runnin in and out of my lifeWhatcha Wanna Do? And you better change your ways and start treatin me right[x3]

[Verse 1: Mia X]I tried to feed you everything you neededAnd if I wrote I love you in the sky, you probably wouldn't read itCause, you actin like it don't even matter no moreSometimes, I feel we in a race, tryin to make it to the doorIs it that I bore you, is it someone else again? Should we put this to an end, and maybe start again as friendsI'm tryin to be mature, but mentally, I'm so tiredAnd you can't even tell me whyI cry feelin stupid, used and aloneWhen it's four in the mornin and you still not homeWhere did we go wrong, it used to be all gravyMakin love all night, callin me your babyBut things got shady, now we ain't even closeTreat me like I should leave, and then don't want me to goSometimes I think I'm stuck, ?some say we goin on that path? And then you raise me on the phone and please let you come backWhatcha Wanna Do?

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]Cause my heart is yearnin for your love[x2]

[Verse 2: Mia X]Now we been through all kinds of dramaBut I'm the only other woman who loves you just as much as mamaI'm tryin to hold on, cause what we had was so deepAnd in relationships, you got to take the bitter with the sweetYou keep runnin in and out, messin with my feelingsPlayin with my mind and I know you see me tryingBut even soldiers fall, remember when you fellRemember the excuses and the lies I had to tell?Put penance? for your bail, even though you gave me hellWhen you was snortin more than half of what you had to sellPut up with all your flings, hold my head, feelin sadBut through all the bull, you know it wasn't that badYou used to make me laugh,

IB: “I guess.”

RC: “People are born with a nature that does what they want to do instead of what God wants.”

IB: “I guess.”

RC: “So now do you think being gay is a choice?”

IB: “Yeah, I guess it is.”

That’s his entire framework.

With a camera in your face and a stranger suggesting that you’re going to hell, it’s kind of hard to argue for yourself; most people would get nervous in that sort of situation. But Comfort has a particular methodology in his interrogations. Because he’s laying out “sins” in a step-by-step way, the flustered bystander can’t always think quickly enough to counter his points. It’s like when a canvasser stops and asks if you have a minute to spare for the environment. I mean, technically I do, but I don’t have the $12 a month you want, and I can’t say that to you right away!

Back to the movie.

The next time Peter sees Diana, he asks if she has a gay sister, and she says no. (Dodged that bullet!) But he still asks her to watch some videos to try to understand his point of view. She isn’t into it.

Diana: I’d rather not. Those people are so condescending.

Peter: Most Christians aren’t like that!

Diana: The Bible says a lot of things, like that God sends gays to hell.

Peter: You don’t get it, he wants to save you!

They bicker. It’s kind of cute. Before Peter leaves, Diana tearfully asks him a favor. Her brother is dying of cancer and she is angry at God. She wants Peter to tell her why it happened, and he says he’ll pray on it.

New scene! We flash to a convenience store, where a rude, young, straight couple is being obnoxious toward a young gay couple. Suddenly, a man pulls out a gun, tells everyone to drop to the floor, and demands all the cash from the register. In a weird moment of comedic relief, the clerk shouts, “Nobody pays with cash anymore!”

The gunman takes turns pointing the gun at different people’s heads until Peter (who happens to

Curiology is a little funky company founded by visual artist Alie Ward. Originally from San Francisco, Ms. Ward relunctantly relocated to Los Angeles five years ago, and has become known for both her apparel line and her paintings.

Working almost exclusively on wood, Ward's paintings show a passion for the exploration of words as labels, and the elasticity of such when applied to simple illustrative images, as seen in her ongoing "Dichotomy" series.

AW: Did I call myself that? I'm such a dork. No, I'd say that, in a way, that's the fictional term for a field I'm passionately drawn to...(Technically, I would be a semiologist though...) One of my greatest attributes and downfalls is that there are so many -ologies I adore. Etymology, entomology, biology, curiology...

_______[ "dime / dozen" ]____________PK: Are you more inclined to oogle over a billboard or a Picasso?

AW: Hahaha. Amusing query, sir. I suppose the nature of billboards and marketing lies in their accessibility, so by virtue of sheer interfacing, I'm spending more time looking at the billboards, as they are all around me. And I could be flayed for saying this, but I'm probably more interested in the mechanism at work on the billboard. I often can't help but think about the plotting and the sheer social science that went down in a board room at some corporate HQ to get me to look at the billboards for a new zesty taco. I think what's interesting about signs and billboards is their drive to communicate something very specific, and what I love about painting is the crude use of signage to communicate ideas that are merely for the sake of the concept itself. There's a certain authority in creating a sign, and it takes the pretentiousness that is so rampant in art, throws it away and makes room for function and simplicity. I love love love making paintings that are very simply trying to communicate a verbal idea, I guess. Wow, I'm rambling.

Would you classify yourself as a writer or painter?

Professionally, recreationally, physically and mentally I am both. But I "write" my paintings as thoughts or sentences before I make them, so perhaps writing trumps it? Curiology literally means writing with pictures, so there you go. Both.

All of the RBR girls have strong STEM backgrounds and belong to RBR’s Academy of Information Technology (AOIT) or its Engineering Academy. Two senior winners, Shelley Banfield and Marie Davidson both plan to continue their study of Computer Science in College. Shelley at Rutgers Honor College and Marie at George Washington University. Victoria Lloyd will study Physics at Harvey Mudd University.

She states of her decision, “Having a good understanding in computer science is a real benefit to any of the STEM fields.

Marie adds, “I enrolled in this academy thinking it might look good on a resume, but found that these are skills we will need the rest of our lives in a field in great demand.”

Shelly was excited about the benefits of the award, one of which included access to a peer-network of technical women in the NCWIT AiC Community.

She states, “It is important to know there is a community. All girls (in the field) need someone to look up to.”

All the girls were part of a new program organized this year by RBR teachers Mandy Galante, Jeremy Milonas and Alison Sweeney called “Girls Who Code.” Every month, for eight months during the school year, fifth to eight graders from RBR’s four sending school districts meet their big sister technology major students at the high school, to encourage more females to enter the Computer and Engineering fields. The lead the girls through fun activities related to coding and technology.

Jeremy Milonas believes the girls mentorship in this program helped earn them the NCWIT award,

He states “It is important for them to be honored so they can take pride in the accomplishments they have achieved in this academy.”

Alison Sweeney adds, “The whole point in starting the Girls Who Code program was to promote women going into technology by our girls working with younger girls. Additionally, we hoped to encourage our current high school student by showing them the opportunities that they might have for scholarships, college and careers.”

The teachers are dedicated to increasing the number of females entering the program citing the growing need for expertise in this area which will provide very high-paying, highly skilled jobs. Recognition programs like the NCIT is one way, they hope the girls will see the value of their work and the benefits to this field of study.

On women entering the Stem fields Tess states, “Some

David Freedman of Winston-Salem, Nifong's lawyer, said Monday an extension of time has been granted. He said he didn't have the new deadline at his fingertips.

Andrew Swerlick, editorial, EmmoryWheel.com (Emmory Univ., Atlanta):Discontent in Durham — The real victim in the Duke Lacrosse scandal? Forget the players or the dancer. It's the judicial system. - The city of Durham is 44 percent black and has a poverty level that surpasses the national average. As Salon.com put it, "The median income of a Durham household is roughly equal to the annual tuition for a Duke student (about $44,000)." Tensions between the wealthy, mainly white, university students and the town's working-class residents have always been a problem...

The question of individual justice is lost in the fiery discussions of race and class relations. Luckily, however, as more and more evidence suggesting the innocence of the lacrosse players comes forth, emotions are taking a back seat to a rational examination of the facts. If things continue the way they are, justice has a good chance of being served. But although this case may ultimately have a just ending, the accused are not always so fortunate. As Dorothy Rabinowitz of The Wall Street Journal discussed in her editorial "The Michael Nifong Scandal" last week, the Duke case is very similar to many child molestation cases of the late 80s and early 90s. Here again, the cases took on greater meaning, becoming symbolic of the fear that we could no long protect our society's children. The accused were not men and women to be found innocent or guilty, but scapegoats on which we could pin our fears and guilt. Some of these scapegoats still suffer for the crimes they never committed...

How ironic that the editors quote approvingly those from the CNN forum who want to "move on" in the Duke lacrosse case. Mike Nifong, acting almost single-handedly, created this embarrassment for Durham, and The Herald-Sun became his co-conspirator, fanning the flames of the current unpleasantness.

By supporting him while he moved forward with these baseless charges, The Herald-Sun not only abdicated the duty of the press to speak truth to power, it helped Nifong give Durham its current reputation. Are you suggesting you are actually surprised that Durham now finds itself where it is? Will you

Hope that helps!

"One thing I am certain of is that there is too much certainty in the world."

There is actually two different firmware loads in the radio at any given time: the "normal" firmware, the stuff that does all of the cool RF stuff we love, and the bootloader firmware.

Programmer (any version) only works if you have good "normal" firmware in the unit. If the normal firmware is messed up then you have to go to Bootloader.

The trick here, of course, is that the Bootloader firmware is protected in a way that makes if VERY difficult to mess it up, thereby acting as a method of last resort in the event you have fouled up the normal firmware. This way you never wind up with a radio bricked so badly it has to be attached to a JTAG programming pod (for many people that equates to "has to go back to the factory", not everyone, though )

The other reason to use Bootloader is if you do not want to have to remember that the old programmer is for 1-->1, 1-->2 and the new programmer is for 2-->2 and 2-->1, which can get confusing for some people.

Of course once we have all abandoned Protocol 1 we'll all forget about old programmer/new programmer and it won't be a problem any more. When that day will be be I can't say.

Thanks very much for the information, I hate to admit it but the reason I am here is that I had protocol 2 firmware running and very very well I might add but got the urge to try the updated sdr-radio software v3.0. Well, sdr-radio would not start so I tried to go back to my trusty Thetis, which is great and it would start to run for maybe two to three seconds and freeze. I then tried database reset, etc., I finally used the bootloader to get back to protocol 1 and powersdr max ps, that took care of the freeze problem. I hope no one else has this issue, if they try sdr-radio they might need to be ready to back track. The only thing that I did not do before down grading firmware / software, is delete wisdom and database files to force completely new

Oakland

Ah, OAKLAND . . . home of the Hell's Angels and the Black Panthers, Isadora Duncan and Jack London, the Kaiser Corporation and Clorox, and the largest container port on the West Coast. This city has character, diversity . . . and a bad image.

In unflattering juxtaposition with that urban jewel across the bay, San Francisco, it rarely escapes unfair comparison - that is, if it's compared at all. Neighborhoods where quaint old buildings house diverse populations are called ''charming'' in San Francisco. In Oakland, similar areas are ''run-down.''

Even when Gertrude Stein tried to say something nice about her hometown it backfired. ''There is no there there'' - a comment, taken out of context, about the changes in her girlhood neighborhood - has become an often-used putdown of a place she was fond of.

With a large black population and inner-city economic decay, combined with its position as the mainland terminus of transcontinental trucking and rail systems and Pacific Ocean trade, Oakland has been disparagingly called ''San Francisco's service entrance.'' The outside image bears only a distorted resemblance to the real character of this city, which has plenty of claims to distinction, if not uniqueness.

Oakland is the most integrated American city by several measures. Its leadership has been inherited by blacks who hold a larger proportion of the power base than members of their race in any other major US city. Under their leadership, with the aid of the corporate community's money and influence, a social and economic renaissance is slowly reversing Oakland's long post-World War II slide. Although it still has economic problems, Oakland could be a sociopolitical model for many cities struggling to accommodate diverse interests that are often at odds.

The difference between Oakland and virtually every other American city with a black mayor and a large black population is that Oakland is truly integrated. It is 47 percent black, 38 percent white, 10 percent Hispanic, and 8 percent Asian - but no single neighborhood is exclusively black or white. (US Census Bureau counts some people in two groups, which makes total over 100 percent.)

Oakland's black mayor, Lionel Wilson, is just one of many minority members holding key positions in the city. The City Council includes four blacks, an Asian, and three whites; the seven-member school board has four blacks. black Rep. Ron Dellums (D

The percentage of jobless managers and executives starting their own firms reached double digits for the first time since 2002, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc.’s first-quarter 2004 Job Market Index. At 10.1 percent, the period’s start-up rate was 51 percent higher than the 6.7 percent rate recorded in the fourth quarter of 2003. The latest figure is the highest since 10.6 percent of jobless managers and executives started businesses in the third quarter of 2000.

The Challenger survey found that 88 percent of those starting a business were older than 40, up from 74 percent in the fourth quarter. “These older individuals may have the most confidence in their abilities to establish a business. Not only do they have years of experience and business know-how, but through their careers they have probably established an extensive list of professional contacts,” says John A. Challenger, the company’s chief executive officer. “The economy is finally starting to re-energize. Interest rates on loans are still low. Even if one’s retirement savings were damaged during the slump, the chances of rebuilding them entirely with a traditional salaried position are slim. Why not risk building a business that could strike it rich?”

Increased start-ups, he says, will be essential to sustaining the country’s economic health. “We are at a point where more and more jobs are going overseas. One way to create new jobs is through new business ventures and a commitment to innovation. It was the rapid growth of dot-com start-ups that reignited the economy in the 1990s. It probably will be start-ups and small businesses that generate the next job boom.” The number of service sector jobs moving overseas is expected to reach 588,000 by 2005, up from 100,000 in 2000.

An improving economy may have been behind a 41 percent surge in chief executive officer turnover in March, Challenger, Gray & Christmas says. “A growing number of companies are transitioning from a business strategy focused on surviving the economic slump to one that stresses expansion and innovation,” CEO Challenger says. The firm’s March report shows that 72 CEO departures were announced in March, compared with the 51 announced in February and 50 CEO changes in January.

The March figure is the largest since Challenger resumed its tracking of CEO departures in December 2003. Nearly three-quarters of the CEO changes—

Wisconsin is traditionally the most Progressive state in America. Progressives win there. Progressives have long won there. Progressives have won there even in years when they lost in much of America. Wisconsin even went in for the La Follette-founded Progressive Party, making it a highly successful third party within the state for about a decade.

The Illinois Senate race keeps going back and forth. Republican Mark Kirk led a while, then Democrat Alexi Giannoulias took it back, but now having won three consecutive polls including PPP’s latest, it seems that Kirk is definitely on top again.

It’s so close though that the polling of third party candidates is a serious issue. It may not matter in the end, though.

I clearly remember the time when Democrat Richard Blumenthal’s military record became a national story. As surprising to some as the story it self was, it was noteworthy that the polls barely budged at the uproar. Blumenthal maintained massive leads against all the Republican prospects.

My how things have changed in that Connecticut Senate race since Republican Linda McMahon won the nomination.

Democrat Patty Murray had a great week earlier this month. The Elway Poll and the CNN/Time poll both coming in and giving her nine point leads over Republican Dino Rossi changed some feelings about the race.

But SurveyUSA already came in since to show the race closing, and now Fox News/POR coming in similarly, it’s pretty easy to say the race is close to a tie now.

Some states get seven or eight polls of their Senate races. West Virginia has had two: Public Policy Polling and Rasmussen Reports. And honestly it seems that we were lucky to get PPP to jump in there.

But now that Rasmussen’s latest is out, it’s official: Republican John Raese leads all the current polling over Democrat Joe Manchin.

Any political party must work as a team to win. While the primary process will become at times a competitive and even divisive, any inability to set those feelings aside and back the nominee will give the party trouble.

A few Republicans this cycle know what kind of trouble that is, but none has more than Dan Maes against Democrat John Hickenlooper for Colorado Governor. He got opposition from the national party, and he’s collapsed in the polls.

With the House update done, it’s

The Dogon’s go as far as describing a third star in the Sirius system, called “Emme Ya” that, to date, has not been identified by astronomers. In addition to their knowledge of Sirius B, the Dogon mythology includes Saturn’s rings and Jupiter’s four major moons. They have four calendars, for the Sun, Moon, Sirius, and Venus,

The Dogon elders not only possess an accurate astronomical understanding of our solar system, but they also have an astonishing clear perception of mankind’s place in the universe, which centers around the invisible stars of the Sirius system.

The Dogon believe Amma is the supreme God, the creator of the universe. Amma means: to hold tight, embrace strongly and keep in the same place”. The Nommo Monitors are the “ancestors” of men, to whom Amma entrusted a part of the management of the universe. Genesis in the Bible tells a similar account of the Nephilim, “Those Who Have Come Down, from the Heaven to Earth.” The Dogon describe an arc landing and displacing a pile of dust raised by a whirlwind presumably a spaceship. The impact roughened the ground and the flame went out when it touched the earth. The ark moved to a hollow that was filled with water, whereupon the aliens emerged.

According to Berossus, a Babylonian historian the whole body of the alien was like a fish; and had under fish’s head another head, and also feet below, similar to a man, subjoined to the fish’s tail. His voice was articulate and provided advanced technology to the Babylonians, how to build cities and temples, develop laws and taught mathematics to create civilization. They also appear in Egyptian, Accadian, and Sumerian myths. The Egyptian Goddess Isis, who is sometimes depicted as a mermaid, is also linked with the star Sirius.

He was similar to the stories of mermen and mermaids. He jumped into the water at sunset. The Sirius Mystery is a pervasive argument for the ancient alien’s theory.

All the news that’s fit to print

As journalists -- and yes, there are a few of us left -- what we choose to report is just as critical as how we report it.

We often have discussions, sometimes disagreements and occasionally outright arguments internally about what we cover, how we cover it and how we put it in front of you.

And, no, it’s not as bad, or as contentious, as it sounds. It’s actually healthy for journalists. It keeps us sharp honest, and often entertained. We clearly don’t get out much.

Just last week, we debated the administration’s press release touting how much consumers would save on premiums thanks to rate reviews as articulated in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. (A colleague actually weighed on in this here, so I won’t get into that.)

The point of contention was over the administration’s $1.2 billion figure, which grew out of some pretty creative math. As such, I refused to fall into their trap and we played the story straight, simply reporting the latest on the rate reviews, which you can check out here. The story wasn’t nearly as sexy as it could have been, but it kept us above the fray.

Two other stories broke today. One, the latest report from the U.S. Census Bureau, gives us the latest numbers on poverty and the uninsured in this country. I’ll weigh in on those figures tomorrow.

The other story stems from yet another self-congratulatory press release from Health and Human Services, which proclaimed how many millions will be able to get health insurance for less than $100 a month. Sounds great, but while the right hand of Kathleen Sebelius is showing us these great numbers, the left is stuck firmly behind her back. We have yet to see a clear, comprehensive list of exchange rates with open enrollment just of couple of weeks away. And, for the record, I don’t believe for a second that they don’t have a spreadsheets of actual costs stashed somewhere in their piles of paperwork.

For an administration so publicly -- and vocally -- big on transparency, they’re awfully bad at it in practice. We could sure use another Eric Snowden to jump up out of HHS and blow the whistle on what’s really going on with not only rates, but the security of their vaunted data hub and their realistic readiness for enrollment

Churches that follow a liturgical year (like my own Episcopal Church, the Methodists, the Lutherans, the Roman Catholics) set aside one day a year to dwell on the Divine Mystery. We call it Trinity Sunday. And that’s where we blow it. We would do ourselves a favor by calling it Mystery Sunday instead.

The Trinity is a mystery before it is a doctrine. But it’s not a mystery in the sense that a detective story is a mystery. Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple will solve this sort of mystery. Bring it to a close and tie up all the loose ends.

The word “mystery” means something else entirely when we’re talking about the Triune God. Who God is exceeds the bounds of finite human reason. Faith is not fundamentally about arriving at the right concepts. Instead, faith is about encountering and surrendering to an inexhaustible, unfathomable mystery.

The Trinity is certainly a doctrine. The central doctrine for Christians. And I will be among the last to deny the importance of thinking about God. Nevertheless, theology is, as Anselm put it, faith seeking understanding. Faith is recklessly abandoning ourselves to the love that relentlessly pursues us. Yielding to how that love shapes our comings and goings on this planet.

Our truest thinking about God emerges as a reflection upon our experience of being loved. Our words and our concepts are important. But they never adequately capture the depth and the breadth of infinite, eternal love.

Scripture teaches us that God is love. Consequently, everything that God does is an expression of love. The universe that we inhabit—into which we are intimately woven—issues from the Divine love.

Most of us were taught that God created all things out of nothing. And while I have no quarrel with this, I recognize that it can lead to a misconception about how God relates to life on Earth. We might think of God the Maker as over there. The created universe as over here. To borrow an image from Diana Butler Bass, God is so distant that God needs an elevator to get down to us from heaven.

For instance, the late 18th, early 19th century English clergyman and philosopher William Paley offered a proof for the existence of God. He argued that God is like a great clockmaker.

If you or I stumbled upon an intricate apparatus like a clock on a deserted beach

“A migrating bird has to be in top form, having the flight feathers in really good shape,” said Kimball L. Garrett, ornithology collections manager at the Museum of Natural History of Los Angeles County, who has not seen the picture from Ivanpah, but has long been concerned about bird deaths at large solar projects.

“If some of its flight feathers are damaged, what does that mean for the rest of the bird’s migration?” he said. “It weakens feathers. These are things people don’t study because — how can you?”

Trying to estimate how many birds could be injured or killed at large-scale solar projects, and what might be done to prevent mortalities — has become a pressing concern for solar developers and environmental agencies as these projects multiply across California.

Of the 34 birds reported dead or injured at Ivanpah in September, 15 had melted feathers. Dozens of other bird carcasses, not singed but with critical injuries, have been found in recent months at two solar projects about to go online on public land between Joshua Tree National Park and Blythe, a town of 20,800 on Interstate 10 near the Arizona border.

(Page 2 of 6)

Last month, 19 birds, 16 of them water fowl or marsh birds, were found dead at Desert Sunlight, a 550-megawatt photovoltaic plant about 50 miles east of Indio. The carcass of a Yuma clapper rail, a federally endangered, medium-sized marsh bird, was found at the project in May.

Environmentalists aired their concerns about potential bird deaths at Palen at a recent public hearing on the project, and days later, state officials issued a call for more information on how to minimize chances of birds being singed or burned.

A key question raised by the California Energy Commission in its Nov. 1 memorandum was how to measure when bird deaths might be “excessive” enough to consider a temporary shutdown of the plant.

The commission also asked whether the project might require official permits allowing the unintentional death of certain animals — called incidental take permits — under federal and state laws covering migratory birds, bald and golden eagles and other protected species.

BrightSource, federal, state and local agencies, and environmental and tribal groups are invited, but not required, to provide answers to the commission’s questions as part of legal briefs typically submitted during the permitting process for large solar plants

This week’s iteration is Smitten Kitchen’s Roasted Eggplant Soup. I actually managed to produce some eggplant in my own garden (or at least, on my balcony) this year, and I needed to use them up – voila, eggplant soup recipe! I call this Eggplant Tomato because the tomato flavour is pretty strong, but it’s also very garlicky and eggplanty and oniony, all with that richer flavour you get from roasting.

In electrolysis, water is split into its constituent elements – hydrogen and oxygen – using electricity. "The challenge in this particular project was linking the two components – high-temperature electrolysis and solar-thermal steam generation. The demands placed on the control technology are very high, which is why this combination has not previously been realised," summarised Günter Schiller, a researcher at the DLR Institute of Engineering Thermodynamics in Stuttgart.

High-temperature electrolysis has a very high efficiency – more than 90 percent. It is thus the most efficient type of hydrogen production, but requires temperatures of between 700 and 900 degrees Celsius. Processes at this temperature level are difficult to manage. Low-temperature electrolysis, on the other hand, operates at around 70 to 100 degrees Celsius and is already commercially available. However, it is characterised by a lower efficiency – between 60 and 80 percent.

To generate the steam required for electrolysis at approximately 750 degrees Celsius, researchers primarily used solar heat and the heat of the high-temperature electrolysis unit. To this end, a special solar heat absorber – the technical term being a receiver – captured the radiation from an artificial Sun in the solar simulator at the DLR Institute of Solar Research in Cologne. Water passing through the receiver turned into steam. 'The most difficult part was generating a steam supply that was as constant and stable as possible, because high-temperature electrolysis does not tolerate fluctuations in pressure. Changes in steam pressure can damage the cells in the electrolysis stack," explained Henrik von Storch from the Institute of Solar Research. Control technology was also required at this point, so that the miniature hydrogen power plant could be assembled and tested in an experiment.

From miniature power plant in the laboratory to application concepts

To guarantee a reliable supply of steam even when the Sun either does not shine or does not shine with sufficient intensity, the DLR energy researchers from the Institute of Engineering Thermodynamics also developed a concept for a suitable thermal store, and implemented this on a separate test stand.

Initial simulations have shown that hydrogen can be generated in a renewable manner at an overall efficiency of between 20 and 25 percent if high-temperature electrolysis and solar-thermal energy are combined. The size of solar-thermal installations can be scaled up relatively easily; electrolysis systems can be expanded in a modular manner. Therefore, the researchers have concluded that very large installations with capacities of more than 100 megawatts are feasible

Joe Zanger, an attorney in White House, has been the forensics coach at St. Joseph School in Madison for three years. His daughter, Clare, has been involved for the last four. “Forensics is worth becoming involved in because the students learn skills they can use for the rest of their lives,” said Zanger. “They learn to organize their thoughts, speak in front of crowds, and gain a self-confidence that simply cannot be achieved in any other activity.

“I’ve seen this manifest itself as Clare has interviewed during the high school admissions process this year,” Zanger continued. “She is confident, well-spoken and very much at ease with the adults who are talking to her.”

Those grown-up attributes don’t come without a great deal of discipline. The students practice every day, and occasionally, visit a younger group within their school to perform their pieces. “The children do much better if they have an audience, and the younger kids love it,” said Melton. “Sometimes the children critique each other. That’s an important part of forensics, to learn how to positively critique. And take it!”

The adult judges – mostly parent volunteers from the schools or the community at large – base their scores on a variety of items, depending on the type of competition: How does the student set the mood? Does he or she have a smooth delivery? They also discern the quality of student eye contact, volume, emphasis, intensity, enunciation, pacing, expressiveness and projection.

The topics of the competing presentations do not have to be of a Catholic nature, but, according to Melton, the program is working toward incorporating more faith into the events. “One category is called audition, and the student uses a piece of prose or a dialogue from a play,” said Melton. “We ask that those be from a Christian reading, or something with a virtue involved.”

Whatever the subject matter, the end result appears to be a more well-rounded student, who may someday make a positive contribution to the world beyond their school. “When you combine the challenging academic curriculum at our diocesan schools with the skills that forensics teaches, you produce a truly impressive young person that is equipped to tackle the next steps of their education,” said Zanger. “And, eventually, play significant leadership roles in our community.”

The diocesan forensics program is continually seeking judges, especially those who are not school

PITTSBURGH (AP) - At least once a month, Beth Tauberg gets a phone call from a frustrated parent whose child is newly diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.

Overwhelmed by a condition that causes their children to have trouble in school or feel like they don’t fit in, parents struggle to find answers.

“It’s really hard, when you first get that diagnosis, to find what direction you’re supposed to go in to help your child,” said Tauberg of O’Hara, who runs the Pittsburgh parent chapter of a national group known as CHADD, for Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.

The demand for services occurs as more people are diagnosed with ADHD. Researchers say about 2 million more children and adolescents were diagnosed in 2011, compared with 2003. Experts attribute the surge to better tools to identify the disorder and recognition by pediatricians of tell-tale symptoms - risk-taking, hyperactivity and distraction - as much more than “kids being kids.”

“In the past, parents were more likely to attribute problems to just laziness or being ‘bad,’ and not even bring this up to the physician,” said Dr. Oscar Bukstein, medical director of DePelchin Children’s Center in Houston and former director of the ADHD program at the University of Pittsburgh. “Behavioral and emotional problems as disease or disorder just was not considered.”

Dr. Kristin Hannibal, a pediatrician, said standards set in the past decade allow physicians to determine who should be diagnosed with ADHD.

“These kids were in the classroom when we were growing up, but they were not diagnosed,” said Hannibal, clinical director of the Child Development Unit at Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh.

The surge in cases prompted doctors nationwide to prescribe drugs to control the disorder. More than two-thirds of people with ADHD take stimulant medications such as Ritalin, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The drugs address core symptoms, but most children need other treatments, said Bukstein.

“The story that medication is all you need is absolutely a false one,” he said.

Marsha Zaleski of Franklin Park said medication plays an important part in the treatment of her son Mark, 14. Without it, the high school freshman can’t finish a chore, do homework or control his anger, she said.

Father, we ask you to fill our minds and hearts with the same burning
longing for unity with you and with each other that Jesus prayed for
the night before his crucifixion. We pray as Jesus prayed,
"May we be brought to complete unity" that the world may know your love
and that you sent Jesus.

We ask Lord that you would live in us and that you would give us the
hearts and minds to live in you and in the Father in the love and unity
you prayed that we would have.

Father may we be instruments of that love and unity and may we realize
this complete unity in our near life times, with no more delay.

In Jesus name we ask it. Amen and amen.

My name is Tony Murphy, and as I post this on GodAndUs.org February 7,
2007, I'm 63 years old. I've heard talk of Christian unity
since Pope John XXIII over four decades ago -- and though there have
been efforts towards that unity, it's just not happened -- certainly
not in any substantive way. This call is one I'm relaying,
not one I'm making. It is Jesus' call. It is his
prayer. He prayed for unity in him to happen. Who
are we to hinder or retard that for which the Son of God -- God in the
flesh -- prayed?

I dearly long to see Christianity well on the way to Jesus being
recognized for what he is in reality -- the Light of the World (Greek, kosmos),
Lord of lords, and King of kings. I eagerly look forward to
when we are immersed in Christian love and closely approaching or
having apprehended complete unity before I die. That is my
prayer. Please, let's all those who name the name of Christ
pray for it and as much as lies within us, make it happen.
Above all let's start living in Jesus Christ and relating to him
personally, us in him and he in us -- that's the only way it will
happen. In the final analysis complete Christian unity is not
something we can bring about but only something we can receive because
we live in Christ. This complete unity is a gracious gift
Jesus gives through the Holy Spirit living in us when we are living in
Jesus.

"There are those that look at things the way they are and ask,

Zach and I sat down and ate a Snickers to celebrate. Reaching the halfway point was a bit exciting at first. However, when the initial excitement wore off and we began hiking again, it felt a bit demoralizing. I imagined everything we had been through— the sand, the thirst, the mountains, the snow, the doubts, the fears, the discomfort, the sheer force of will to keep putting one foot in front of another— and thought, Oh man, we have to do that all over again. That thought was nearly unbearable. I consoled myself with the fact that the Sierra was supposed to be the hardest section of the trail, and Oregon the easiest. So even if we were halfway as far as mileage was concerned, in terms of actual days we were more than halfway.

We wound down the side of the mountain, hurrying through open patches and lingering in the shade to avoid the blazing sun. After a few miles, we stumbled upon Highway 36. Here we had the option of hitching into the town of Chester, but we saw no reason to. Plus, there were people giving out trail magic by the side of the road! This couple had thru-hiked in 2013 and had returned just for today to congratulate people on reaching the halfway point. I soon learned that the wife was an incredible baker, and ate several of her homemade cookies and banana bread. I was feeling so hot that I even drank a soda, which I don’t normally like.

As we were sitting on a log talking to the couple, a brown VW van pulled up and some hikers hopped out of the back. A young guy in a button-up shirt smiled at us from the driver’s seat. “Would you guys like a ride into town?” he asked.

Zach and I looked at each other, and figured that if an opportunity was just going to drop in our laps, we might as well take it. “Sure!”

We hopped into the back of the van, and the driver, who introduced himself as Ty, took us down the highway eight miles to the charming little town of Chester. It was big enough to have a few hotels and restaurants and a fairly long main street, but still a sleepy little town where hitchhiking looked like it would be easy. We sighted several hikers milling about.

“I’m the new pastor at the Lutheran church in Chester,” Ty said as

Books

We downsized our book collection when we moved into our apartment but sometimes, we still find our books not fitting all the way onto our bookshelf. Instead of getting a whole new bookshelf, we decided to donate books that we had duplicates of, or books that we knew we probably wouldn't read again.

BONUS TIP: Try taking your books to a local book store that buys back books. We went to Ukazoo and we were able to sell a lot of our books!

Fridge

Inside AND out. First, we looked at all our magnets and realized that it looked and felt way too cluttered. We decided to get rid of some of our magnets because we have A TON. We took down old pictures, flyers, Save the Dates, etc. that had been hanging on our fridge for what seems like forever.

Then, we ventured inside to toss anything with an expiration date. Any food that hadn't expired yet but we knew we weren't going to eat, we asked our neighbors and family if they would like it instead. Most of them gladly accepted our donations! This will help you be more reasonable next time you go grocery shopping.

Wallet

This is a big one for me. I always have so many random things in my wallet. I went through an took out all my receipts and tossed them. Then, I took out all my giftcards and called the number on the back to see how much was left on them. I tossed the ones that were empty and placed the ones that were filled in a basket near our door so that before I leave the house I can always grab a gift card I might need (simply because I'm a gift card hoarder and still have gift cards from years ago!) Then, I put all my extra change into our change jar, and got rid of random business cards. You'll feel so much lighter.

First, Do No HarmBy Senator Chris Lauzen

In the next six months, I anticipate that there will be a vote in the General Assembly to legalize spending $125,000,000 of taxpayer funds to conduct controversial and speculative embryonic stem cell research. Although financial experts have recently made the case that Illinois is insolvent considering only its current obligations, our attention will be diverted from education, property taxes, safe transportation, and reduction of pervasive corruption by seductive promises of cures for diseases like diabetes, Alzheimer's, and even cancer.

I support privately-funded stem cell research that does not destroy innocent human life. Obviously, we all want cures for diseases; the question is, "What are we willing to sacrifice to get them?"

A human embryo, a fertilized egg, unites the essential genetic material that defines an individual human being. In the process of embryonic stem cell research as it is currently practiced, scientists replace and discard the original life within the egg with foreign genetic material that they prefer to grow there instead. The unique identity of an individual human being vanishes for eternity.

Naturally, we all want cures for diseases. My grandfather suffered from diabetes. My brother suffers from it now. My sister survived juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. It was tragic to watch my father slowly debilitated by a neurodegenerative disease. Every person who reads this newspaper has a stake in the success of scientists, although eventually each of us will lose our struggle with immortality.

There are at least three major areas of reason why all conscientious legislators ought to hesitate before they leap onto the bandwagon of approving $125,000,000 of taxpayer money to fund embryonic stem cell research, i.e. moral compromise, scientific productivity and non-destructive alternatives, and fiscal irresponsibility.

Ask yourself the question, "When is the cure for my disease more important than your life or your individual human identity?" Responsible human beings have recognized from the beginning of medicine that there need to be limits to what some are willing to do to others in the name of research. Hippocrates, the Greek philosopher and father of medicine, taught the first medical ethic, "First, do no harm", in his Hippocratic Oath. The unique identity of an individual human being is the first casualty to this research as it is currently done.

The destruction of an embryo is not necessary to derive the greatest portion of research benefits in two ways. First, patients with 58 different medical conditions

So far so good, right!?. Now we need to go one step forward. My project has a console app and a unit test project and I need to build both prior to run the unit test project. To achieve this I will have to piggyback on MsBuild.

Here is the structure of my project:

Now I need to build the projects CountingWordsConsole and MapReduce.Tests together prior to the running of the tests. Here is my msbuild file to build my solution:

And here is the configuration in TeamCity:

I got rid of the previous build step for Visual Studio and this time I'm creating an MsBuild step that will target all my project files.

You will also notice that in the MsBuild file there is a shared argument between TeamCity and MsBuild called ReleaseFolder. This property is set up in TeamCity with the folder location of where my projects will be built. This will help us later as to identify where are our binaries and how we pick those up from TeamCity as artifacts.

Notice that in the MsBuild file the notation of this property is via $(ReleaseFolder) whereas in TeamCity is %system.ReleaseFolder%.

Now that we have the project up and running via MsBuild, it's time to set up NUnit and dotCover.

Setting up NUnit and dotCover1. Get the latest NUnit.
You can get the latest NUnit 3.2.1 from here. Download the .msi file and install the typical installation. This will leave the files in the following folder:

C:\Program Files (x86)\NUnit.org\nunit-console\

Add a new build step in TeamCity and configure it to run it for NUnit 3.x. As soon as you run the project you will get the following error:

This version of NUnit 3 is not a release version and is not compatible with TeamCity. Please update NUnit to a newer release version.

I even tried with NUnit 3.0 RC and NUnit 3.0 but the error never went away. How to fix this? via command line.

To make things a bit more exciting, I will configure directly dotCover as this one will run NUnit by default. dotCover comes automatically by default with TeamCity:
("C:\TeamCity\buildAgent\tools\dotCover") and you only need to configure your project

In information technology, big data is a collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications. The challenges include capture, curation, storage,search, sharing, analysis, and visualization. The trend to larger data sets is due to the additional information derivable from analysis of a single large set of related data, as compared to separate smaller sets with the same total amount of data, allowing correlations to be found to "spot business trends, determine quality of research, prevent diseases, link legal citations, combat crime, and determine real-time roadway traffic conditions.

Big data is difficult to work with using relational databases and desktop statistics and visualization packages, requiring instead "massively parallel software running on tens, hundreds, or even thousands of servers". What is considered "big data" varies depending on the capabilities of the organization managing the set, and on the capabilities of the applications that are traditionally used to process and analyze the data set in its domain. "For some organizations, facing hundreds of gigabytes of data for the first time may trigger a need to reconsider data management options. For others, it may take tens or hundreds of terabytes before data size becomes a significant consideration.

What is Big Data in Definition

Big data usually includes data sets with sizes beyond the ability of commonly-used software tools to capture, curate, manage, and process the data within a tolerable elapsed time. Big data sizes are a constantly moving target, as of 2012 ranging from a few dozen terabytes to many petabytes of data in a single data set. With this difficulty, a new platform of "big data" tools has arisen to handle sensemaking over large quantities of data, as in the Apache "Hadoop" Big Data Platform.

Some but not all MPP relational databases have the ability to store and manage petabytes of data. Implicit is the ability to load, monitor, back up, and optimize the use of the large data tables in the RDBMS.

The practitioners of big data analytics processes are generally hostile to slower shared storage[citation needed], preferring direct-attached storage (DAS) in its various forms from solid state disk (SSD) to high capacity SATA disk buried inside parallel processing nodes. The perception of shared storage architectures—SAN and NAS—is that they are relatively slow, complex, and expensive. These qualities are not consistent with big data analytics systems that

Vanderhurst has performed fieldwork in Nigeria for more than 10 years, and for this project she conducted participant observation embedding herself in the shelter for more than a year. During the past two decades the Nigerian government has stopped many young migrant women from trying to leave the country, often to Europe, identifying them as victims of human trafficking and referring them to shelters run by a federal anti-trafficking agency. At these shelters, counselors worked with women in an effort to reduce their vulnerability to be being trafficked again.

Vanderhurst said how religion came into play in her observations in daily interactions in the clinic surprised her.

"I thought people were going to use religion as a way to judge women's experiences. That still happens, but women were also talking about how God had a plan for them to enter migrant sex work," said Stacey Vanderhurst, KU assistant professor in the Department of Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies. "And I was surprised the counselors working in this space didn't necessarily tell them they were wrong but instead engaged in a deeper theological conversation about how to understand their situation and how to make good decisions."

Many of the women in the study had expressed the desire to leave the country, and they would equate an offer to travel to Italy or elsewhere as an answer to a prayer for direction, for example.

Shelter staff would mostly try to steer the women away from migrating or lifestyles that might put them at risk of human trafficking into more entrepreneurial work, such as hair styling or other careers, she said, suggesting that this transition in the shelter might be part of a divine plan for their lives.

"As an anthropologist, I'm less interested in who was right or wrong in these conversations, but instead want to know how they fit in with other patterns in Nigeria," Vanderhurst said. "How do government officials talk about and use state power, when no one trusts the government? They can force these women into the shelter, but what do they do next to convince them to change their lives?"

The conversations surrounding religion demonstrate how ad hoc relationships of governance can be forged among even fervently contested encounters between citizens and the state in Nigeria.

"Both in research and activism work, we do a good job talking about structural factors that make people vulnerable, but spend less time listening to people's own version of their experiences, especially when those stories are framed in religious discourses that we don't share" Vanderhurst said.

We have a consultant working for us that we would like to make an offer to.
However, due to internal equity issues, we are not able to offer him the
base he is looking for. What are some creative things we could offer him in
lieu of a higher base? Other than a sign on bonus, perhaps a retention
bonus, higher vacation accrual...is there anything else I""m not thinking of?

Consultants - you do not pay benefits, 401K, management costs are lower,
payroll taxes, etc. also, it is a need base. You can lay them off without
any compensation or wait periods which are offered to your employees. Also,
consultants, pay their own commuting and residential expenses when they go
to different jobs in different locations. All these aspects, when you add
up, equates to more than 50% of pay. Hence, on-paper it may seem like you
are paying more, in fact you are not. Also, you are contractors for a time
when you need a particular skill for the job

SGC Milwaukee!!

Hello there! I have been traveling all over for all sorts of printmaking goodness since the last post. The first big story to cover is SGCI's Conference in Milwaukee- this is the largest print conference in the US- only the 3rd one I've been to so far (since Philly and DC- sorry to miss St Louis and New Orleans!) although I did quite enjoy the mid-sized MAPC in the fall. I was lucky to drive up with Andrea Knarr, print prof of Northern Kentucky U and her former student, Carola Bell, now at the Cincy Art Museum.

first thing is the registration table, as always- getting oriented after driving in late the night before

and after a rush job to the printer, I got propaganda out for Tiger Lily press and the Ohio print co-ops. Look- someone is reading it right now!

the vendor's fair- always a little crazy first thing

they even had a second room- here is Takach press

the first lecture I went to- Leslie Dill, Tom Sleigh, Paul Wong and Peter Kruty talk about their collaboration for the book, "If I had a Blueprint of History"

luckily I caught Peter Kruty's demo of how he printed the plates for Leslie

they were thick metal-backed photopolymer plates printed on a magnetic bed

we even got to look at an original Leslie Dill drawing! interesting how he had to translate her beautiful washes, charcoal marks and smudges through photo-based letterpress

later that night we had the Open Portfolio session. very different as it was at night on the first night and spread out on 3 different floors. in my past experience it's been during the day on a Saturday, all squished into a giant ballroom

I always love the work that comes from my alma mater, Kutztown University, PA. here is Andrea with some amazing prints!

Josh Dannin, also from KU, now at Ohio University and often writes for Printeresting

Kathryn Polk- from Memphis- really love her work!

here is my table- I have the last time slot till 10pm. sooo tired! but a lot of folks come up to talk to me about Tiger Lily and print co-ops, so that was wonderful. and yes, some good feedback on the work.

me at my table-

Like its subsequent worlds, Dino Domain has a Trophy Race that the player can enter after they win against Tricky again. Also like the other worlds, T.T. walks around the center of Dino Domain's hub, and the player can bump into him to review their game progress.

Ancient Lake is set in a canyon. It has a rocky, gray road with grass patches and trees on the side. The second half of the level features a river and a wandering dinosaur. It occasionally cross the road and may trample over racers. Ancient Lake has the world's Wish Key, which is needed to unlock the world's Challenge Level, Fire Mountain.

Fossil Canyon is a sandy, dusty, and rugged area. Its race takes place during sunset. Another dinosaur appears in the stage, but it remains in the background and does not interfere with the race. Racers drive through a cave at one point, which can either be entered from the usual curved path or from a Zipper to shortcut across a lake just outside of the cave.

Jungle Falls is set in another rocky, rugged area. The course starts out relatively bumpy from large dinosaur footprints in the road. The path leads to a ditch, with two small waterfalls forming a lake into it. Racers can drive across the ditch from a bridge and some empty ruins just ahead. Racers encounter a large dinosaur skull shortly after they exit the ruins. They can use a Zipper below it to quickly reach the finish line. Jungle Falls is considered the shortest race track of the game.

Hot-Top Volcano takes place inside a volcanic cavern. It is the first course where racers use Planes and cannot use Cars. They have to pilot through a cave and even past a large dinosaur from the first two courses. Hot Top Volcano is filled with lava, but it does not effect the racers.

The player races against the world boss Tricky on a racetrack that spirals up a mountain and ends on its summit. The race features rolling boulders, and Tricky may knock over stone pillars that block part of the path. The racer must avoid these pillars or being trampled over by Tricky, both of which slow them down. Tricky provides the racer with part of the Wizpig Amulet after he loses at the rematch.

The player can access this Challenge Level after they obtain

1. I like the creativity about it, the what if's, although I do agree that most of the times it comes dwon to wish fulfillment.

2. I can be quite lazy at times, so there's sloth and when I do get angry, I have broken stuff around the house so there's wrath. As for the others, not so much, perhaps a little bit of envy.

Weight gain

Insomnia

Hair loss

Low libido

Acne

Abnormal digestion

Slowed metabolism

High cortisol levels can suppress other normal bodily functions and lead to fat storage, muscle breakdown, and slowed metabolism.

The most effective way to reduce your cortisol levels, and its impact on your body, is to reduce stress. Low impact exercise and more sleep can also help.

And a note for coffee drinkers (sorry!)… Caffeine can raise cortisol levels, so if you’re struggling with stress or hormone-related issues, consider cutting back or choosing decaffeinated options.

3. Ghrelin, the hunger messenger

While leptin tells you when you’re full, the hormone ghrelin lets you know when you’re hungry. At normal levels, it serves an important function, but too much ghrelin can make you crave foods and overeat.

Lack of sleep, stress, and other hormone imbalances can all lead to ghrelin spikes. If you’ve ever felt hungry when you’re stressed or close to your period, that’s a ghrelin spike.

Reproductive hormones raise ghrelin levels, and inevitably make it more difficult to maintain a balanced appetite and a healthy weight. If you find yourself continuously feeling hungry or craving certain foods, it’s important to check how your sex hormones are functioning.

4. Adiponectin, the protein hormone that regulates glucose levels

Adiponectin helps the body to maintain normal glucose levels. It’s another important hormone involved in weight loss because it helps to regulate insulin levels and the breakdown of fat. Having optimal levels of this hormone reduces your chances of getting diabetes.

Adiponectin is anti-inflammatory in nature, so the body releases it in situations where you need to combat inflammation. This means that junk foods, highly acidic foods, or injuries can result in over exposure to adiponectin.

When this happens, your body is prevented from burning fat efficiently as it tries to combat the effects of increased adiponectin and restore balance.

5. Insulin, the fat trapper and blood sugar regulator

Most people know this hormone through its reputation as being closely linked to diabetes. Its role in processing food, particularly sugar, makes it one of the most vital hormones in maintaining a healthy weight.

This is what leads to diabetes, as well as an impaired ability

Motorola won a German injunction against Apple in December over a patent on a "Method for Performing a Countdown Function During a Mobile-Originated Transfer for a Packet Radio System." In short, it meant that any Apple products that use 3G data would be affected, and Apple's removal of the 3G-equipped iPad 2, iPhone 3GS, and iPhone 4 on Friday were a result of the enforcement of the December decision.

So why wasn't the iPhone 4S included in this enforcement? As pointed out by FOSS Patents, the iPhone 4S uses a Qualcomm-made baseband chip that the previous 3G-equipped Apple devices do not have. It's likely that Motorola and Qualcomm's cross-licensing agreement extends to Apple in the case of the iPhone 4S, which is why that device remains unaffected by this particular injunction.

Shortly after the enforcement took place on Friday morning, Apple told All Things D that it planned to add the removed products back to its online store very soon. "Apple appealed this ruling because Motorola repeatedly refuses to license this patent to Apple on reasonable terms, despite having declared it an industry standard patent seven years ago," a spokesperson said. "All iPad and iPhone models will be back on sale through Apple’s online store in Germany shortly."

Indeed, almost immediately after that statement was published, the appeals court issued a temporary suspension of the injunction "after Apple made a new license payment offer."

iCloud injunction

Separately, the Mannheim Regional Court ruled on Friday that Apple had also infringed upon a different patent owned by Motorola that targets the use of iCloud to push and sync e-mail across multiple devices. The injunction is permanent—once it becomes time to start enforcing the ruling, those who use iCloud to sync their e-mail may be forced to look at other, non-push options.

(Some publications are implying that these two events—the removal of Apple's 3G devices from the online store and the iCloud injunction—are related, but they are not. They both just happened to occur on the same day from the same court.)

Moto delivering a beating

Apple has not been lucky lately in its legal battles against Motorola, and Moto isn't letting up anytime soon. The manufacturer has also pointed several lawsuits in Apple's direction in the US, with the most recent one targeting the iPhone 4S and iCloud. This is in addition

"To this observer, it seems that Liberals today don't stand for much in the way of principles. I have the impression that they will endorse anything and everything which might return them to power and nothing which won't, whatever the merits of either. It's all about getting to power, and it shows."

- Ambassador Robert Fowler, Canada 150

Fowler said what an awful lot of us have been thinking and saying for more than a year now. He only pointed out the obvious when he warned the Liberal Party is in danger of "losing its soul" in the direction it's been taking.

Will Ignatieff and all his IgLibs listen? Without restoring progressivism to the party, the new LPC will never be anything more than "conservative lite."

6 comments:

A good starting point would be the Tar Sands. Will he continue to support their expansion, or call for a moratorium on development pending "tough" new environmental regulations as he calls them? Will he continue to promise to strengthen Canada's position in the world with clean energy innovation while ignoring the ongoing pollution of air and water in northern Alberta?

CWTF, there's no doubt that Ignatieff has been divisive to the LPC. His approaches have probably been just fine for Bay Street but have fallen flat on Main Street, small town Canada.

LMA, I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for Iggy to reverse himself on the Tar Sands. "Clean energy" is a sop to environmentalism, a dodge promising grand future redemption while delivering nothing.

I'm just working through James Hansen's new book "Storms of My Grandchildren." Hansen says pols who talk about carbon caps or cap and trade solutions are deceiving their people. He says that we're at the point where we simply have to reconcile ourselves to the reality that remaining fossil fuels will simply have to be left underground, particularly coal.

Iggy's environmental approach is 20-years behind the science and padded with nonsense and platitudes.

You should read the Toronto Star article about the nonsense Ignatieff was spouting after the conference about decentralizing Canada's national decision-making mechanisms. He wants a conclave of "deciders" (a George W. Bush term) to shape policy. What ever happened to responsible, elected democracy? His inane babbling suggests he would sever government from the populace and allow the country to be st

1. Kings

2012-13: 27-16-5 (59 points)

5th in West

Losing defensive stalwart Rob Scuderi to free agency will hurt, and they'll need Jake Muzzin to step up. They also need Matt Frattin to boost their weak scoring from the left side. He likely will skate alongside Mike Richards and Jeff Carter. Jonathan Quick could be the U.S. Olympic team's starting goalie at the Sochi Olympics. Two concerns: Dustin Brown missed most of camp because of a hamstring pull, a bad start for a player who must be physical to be effective, and center Anze Kopitar must shake the scoring woes that plagued him last season.

2. Sharks

2012-13: 25-16-7 (57 points)

6th in West

The Sharks have become Logan Couture's team since the dynamic forward figuratively took the leadership reins from Joe Thornton. As always, they have tons of talent, a fine goalie in Antti Niemi (2.16 goals-against, .924 save percentage) and excellent centers. Maybe Couture and freewheeling Brent Burns, who ignited the team after he moved up from defense to wing, have the grit to carry the Sharks to the next level.

3. Coyotes

2012-13: 21-18-9 (51 points),

10th in West

Coach Dave Tippett and general manager Don Maloney worked wonders with a small budget while the NHL ran the Coyotes. New owners George Gosbee and Anthony LeBlanc have brought stability and agreed to sign proven center Mike Ribeiro to add scoring depth. Defensemen Oliver Ekman-Larsson and Keith Yandle are budding stars. The Coyotes should return to the playoffs after missing last season.

If Teemu Selanne regains the form he displayed early last season, if Dustin Penner is revived by being reunited with Ryan Getzlaf and Corey Perry, and if Jakob Silfverberg shows the skill that persuaded the Ducks to trade Bobby Ryan for him, this could be a good season. But that's a lot of ifs. And their defense has holes minus the injured She

Step Four: Make your rocky outcroppings… well… rocky.Using your cheap kitchen knife, use a combination of cuts and gouges to carve the rough edges of your rocky outcroppings. This can be done by sinking the edge of the knife into the foam at an angle and then tearing the section out, making a rough triangular shape. Do this at random to your edges EXCEPT YOUR FLAT EDGE until you are happy. Then, beat them unmerciful with your rock just like you did the large foam sheets. Treat them like they owe you lunch money. Do this to the edges as well (again, except the flat edge) so they also take the rock texture. If you are making a thicker outcropping with layers, then make sure that your angle cuts go into all of the layers to help make it look like one, large rock. Once the carving is done on layers, use the drywall filler to blend the seams together. You can easily do this by putting a bit on your finger and rubbing it onto the piece to get it to blend into the cracks. the filler can be smoothed or thinned with a bit of water applied to your finger and rubbed over the piece.

With this portion done, you may wish to add a bit of extra texture to the layered pieces to make it look a bit more realistic. Taking some white glue, place a dab down near the corners of the layers and place some small stones there. Once you get those in place, put more glue down and in between the stones and add the ballast. Let it all dry.

I will state it all again. LEAVE YOUR MEASURED FLAT EDGES ALONE! These are vital to help with the modular build.

Step Five: Paint all of the rocky portions, flat edges, and large squares in umber.Cover it all. Then, when dry, look for any exposed foam and cover it again. Then when that layer is dry, check for thin spots and any exposed areas you missed and paint them again. Repeat until it is all brown.

Step Six: Drybrush all of the rocky portions with the gray.I hope we all know to drybrush at this point. If not, add a dab of paint to the brush and wipe it until there is barely any paint on the brush. Then using even strokes, apply it to the pieces, catching all of the raised portions of the rocky sections. This may take a few
